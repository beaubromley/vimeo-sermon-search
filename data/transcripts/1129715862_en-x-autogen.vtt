1
00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:04.045
Is it too late to give a confidence monitor?

2
00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:19.525
That's what we,

3
00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:23.485
some of them might be on the way.

4
00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:28.245
I clue. I Oh, okay. Well, very good.

5
00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:49.685
Have you watched your, uh, sermons?

6
00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:52.565
Have your, your little left, your little cushion?

7
00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.205
I hadn't got to yet. No.

8
00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:56.965
How much time to that are they gonna give you?

9
00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:02.605
I'm not doing it tonight. Brad does it tonight. Who? Brad.

10
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:25.765
Air. So, well,

11
00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:28.565
the doors were closed to remember the,

12
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.885
before they got the new units.

13
00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.085
It took forever to get this place cooled off.

14
00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:36.525
Now it like that, it went from,

15
00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:38.485
it went from hypothermia.

16
00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:40.365
There have been times I've been actually

17
00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:47.805
took my hands off the camera for second, like, I couldn't,

18
00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.845
he never moves, moves.

19
00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:54.245
The one time I'm sitting there.

20
00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:07.845
No, I'm sorry. Hi.

21
00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:14.565
The one

22
00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:19.205
everything up to the air.

23
00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:21.645
I said I

24
00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:33.565
can't,

25
00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:40.285
it's here.

26
00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:41.485
One or the other. Right? It's here.

27
00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:43.885
You know Mike, Mike on production? Yeah.

28
00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:49.205
Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

29
00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:54.645
Or you stuff, or it's warm

30
00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:59.765
and there's no way to, um, some kind of

31
00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:02.765
goes down and then it comes back.

32
00:04:03.545 --> 00:04:04.005
You have a,

33
00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:18.045
I know it's a big space, but these

34
00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:21.365
units, they used to be hours.

35
00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:24.485
Remember hours.

36
00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:28.645
You came in here and said, Hey, everybody

37
00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:30.205
head over into the sanctuary.

38
00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:35.725
Sometime everybody would be going, uh oh. It's be warm.

39
00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:37.285
It's

40
00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:45.085
when it gets to a certain temperature to,

41
00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:55.605
oh, here it

42
00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:58.565
doesn't, David.

43
00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:05.045
Oh, really? I the door.

44
00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:10.445
Thank you. That's why I have,

45
00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:15.525
I mean, my hands are still cold.

46
00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:16.205
Yeah.

47
00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:55.445
Back row. People

48
00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:02.805
get all your time about today.

49
00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:09.405
Why?

50
00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:31.165
Okay.

51
00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:42.045
What's up?

52
00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:56.085
Anybody not have handouts? Hello?

53
00:08:02.955 --> 00:08:04.725
Anybody else not have handout?

54
00:08:09.815 --> 00:08:10.165
Scary?

55
00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:28.285
Is it working? No. No. I mean, I got, I've got it.

56
00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:31.365
There's no, there's no, I think it's worse.

57
00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:49.565
I told I don't do that. I sleep on my side,

58
00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:51.125
but I think I'm gonna try it again.

59
00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:01.685
Can't stand first. Then she rolls over and go.

60
00:09:02.545 --> 00:09:05.405
It blows out her mouth on me. Roll over.

61
00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:10.245
You don't, don't, you don't. That sucks.

62
00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:14.005
I'm surprised it doesn't bleed over into that.

63
00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:16.765
Maybe I do,

64
00:09:16.905 --> 00:09:21.125
but you did.

65
00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:26.045
I am used to not teach them without a microphone,

66
00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:28.285
but I've been told some of You're hard of hearing on the,

67
00:09:33.945 --> 00:09:35.085
so I'll use a microphone.

68
00:09:40.755 --> 00:09:42.205
Anybody not get a hand up?

69
00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:47.205
Very good. Well, we need to go ahead and get started

70
00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:52.005
and, uh, we'll jump right into our

71
00:09:52.005 --> 00:09:53.245
handout in just a few minutes.

72
00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:54.885
I'm gonna, I'm gonna share some things

73
00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:56.125
before we get to the handout.

74
00:09:57.145 --> 00:09:59.085
Uh, my name is Aaron Ferguson.

75
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:02.365
I'm, uh, privileged to be able to serve

76
00:10:02.365 --> 00:10:03.525
as one of your elders.

77
00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:08.445
And can I just say before I get started, we are so grateful

78
00:10:09.145 --> 00:10:12.405
for your participation in this semester of this class.

79
00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:15.965
We were just talking about this last night at our meeting,

80
00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:20.445
how encouraged we've been by your, uh, faithfulness

81
00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:22.405
to attend this class.

82
00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:23.925
And usually after fall break,

83
00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:27.005
it goes down very quickly and you're still here.

84
00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:29.245
So we're so thankful

85
00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:32.605
and just grateful that you guys are taking the time

86
00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:35.405
to invest in a really deep study

87
00:10:36.425 --> 00:10:38.645
on the doctrines of scripture.

88
00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:43.005
So thank you for that. Tonight is, is no less deep.

89
00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:45.405
It's maybe even deeper.

90
00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:48.125
And that's the topic of the providence of God.

91
00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:52.125
And if I could pick one attribute of God,

92
00:10:52.145 --> 00:10:55.605
that's my favorite, I don't know if that's fair to say.

93
00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.525
Can you have a favorite of your attributes of God?

94
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:02.005
I'm not sure, but I do. And it's, that's the providence

95
00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:03.245
of God for two reasons.

96
00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:09.565
One, this doctrine is profound. There's no doubt.

97
00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:14.805
But it's personal. It's profound, but it's personal.

98
00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:16.645
You don't know what providence is.

99
00:11:16.705 --> 00:11:20.365
The idea that God is sovereign over everything.

100
00:11:20.365 --> 00:11:25.245
He's in control over every molecule, every minute,

101
00:11:25.535 --> 00:11:30.325
every second, every nation, every event, every individual,

102
00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:31.965
all the minute details.

103
00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:36.765
And yet you and I have all this leeway to make decisions

104
00:11:36.765 --> 00:11:38.525
and do the things we want to do in a day.

105
00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:41.205
And somehow he makes it all work together

106
00:11:41.265 --> 00:11:42.525
for his good purposes.

107
00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:47.085
That is profound. Think about that for a second.

108
00:11:47.235 --> 00:11:48.325
That will blow your mind.

109
00:11:49.025 --> 00:11:51.445
But at the same time, it's personal.

110
00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:56.125
And he has this big plan for the whole universe.

111
00:11:58.145 --> 00:12:00.605
Who am I man? He's got a plan for you as well.

112
00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:05.245
And he has plans down to the, the

113
00:12:05.885 --> 00:12:07.245
smallest details in your life.

114
00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:10.925
It's personal and you're a part of his plan.

115
00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:14.245
That to me, that is, again,

116
00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:16.405
profound and personal.

117
00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:18.925
I love this. I love this doctrine.

118
00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:21.125
Second reason I love this doctrine is

119
00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:22.285
I get to teach it every day.

120
00:12:23.405 --> 00:12:24.525
I, uh, if you don't know,

121
00:12:24.605 --> 00:12:27.765
I teach at a little Christian school in Oklahoma City.

122
00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:31.285
Uh, I've been there 32 years, my 32nd year.

123
00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:33.725
And I get to teach history.

124
00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:38.165
And I have the leeway at CHA to teach

125
00:12:38.755 --> 00:12:42.445
history from a biblical perspective, which I was not taught.

126
00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.125
And my guess is, you either were you,

127
00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:46.645
but what does that mean to teach history

128
00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:48.005
from a biblical perspective?

129
00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:53.085
It means to teach it from a providential view.

130
00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.565
What does that mean? God's in control.

131
00:12:55.715 --> 00:12:58.405
He's in control of the whole story of history.

132
00:12:58.915 --> 00:13:02.365
He's got a plan from the beginning to the very end

133
00:13:02.505 --> 00:13:03.605
and everything in between.

134
00:13:03.665 --> 00:13:07.125
And he's got a purpose for every nation, every event,

135
00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:10.605
every individual I get to every day I get to,

136
00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:12.125
to, to talk about that.

137
00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:15.725
What was God's purpose for you? Fill in the blank.

138
00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:18.005
That's what I get to do every day.

139
00:13:18.025 --> 00:13:21.085
And it's, it brings history to life.

140
00:13:21.925 --> 00:13:25.005
I was not taught that way. I was taught, you know,

141
00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:28.805
about a bunch of dead people, uh, a long time ago,

142
00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:31.365
memorized these dates and yada, yada yada.

143
00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:33.965
And, uh, it was, it was boring.

144
00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:36.365
How many of you, oh, I shouldn't ask.

145
00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:40.205
How many of you were bored stiff in your history classes?

146
00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:43.085
And it was because you weren't taught from a

147
00:13:43.085 --> 00:13:44.445
providential perspective.

148
00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:47.885
If you walk into a history class, knowing

149
00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.485
everything we talk about has a purpose and a meaning,

150
00:13:51.585 --> 00:13:54.485
and God fits it into this giant plan.

151
00:13:55.595 --> 00:13:57.445
Okay, now I can get excited.

152
00:13:57.475 --> 00:13:59.485
What was God's purpose for Alexander the Gray?

153
00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:03.925
What's God's purpose for purpose? Abraham Lincoln?

154
00:14:05.165 --> 00:14:09.185
What's God's purpose for me, that brings history to life.

155
00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:10.465
And that's why I love this.

156
00:14:11.265 --> 00:14:14.505
I, uh, was 23 when I came to CHA, right outta college.

157
00:14:15.075 --> 00:14:16.705
Never even heard the word providence.

158
00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:20.065
I grew up in a, in the church.

159
00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:21.785
I grew up in a Christian family.

160
00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:25.425
No one ever taught the doctrine of providence

161
00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:27.865
on a public school product.

162
00:14:28.065 --> 00:14:30.545
I didn't hear providence in public schools.

163
00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:34.145
So I'm 23, I come to CHA, they put me in a class

164
00:14:34.255 --> 00:14:36.745
with a video from RC sprawl.

165
00:14:37.005 --> 00:14:40.105
Mm-hmm. Called the Providence of God.

166
00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:43.065
And that was my introduction to this doctrine.

167
00:14:43.645 --> 00:14:46.665
And I was like, how come I've never heard this before?

168
00:14:47.895 --> 00:14:50.985
Mind blowing profound and personal.

169
00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:53.165
And then I came to realize,

170
00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:54.605
after studying all these years,

171
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:58.325
our forefathers were very familiar with this doctrine.

172
00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:02.965
They used the word providence almost

173
00:15:03.825 --> 00:15:05.085
in everything they said.

174
00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:09.125
And so it's very fun for me to point out the use

175
00:15:09.285 --> 00:15:10.565
of providence in history.

176
00:15:10.715 --> 00:15:14.325
It's unbelievable. They called it the hidden hand, the hand

177
00:15:14.325 --> 00:15:17.165
of God, the invisible hand providence.

178
00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:19.645
Unbelievable. So our forefathers been

179
00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:20.885
to this doctrine, thank you.

180
00:15:21.145 --> 00:15:22.685
And it's come to life for me,

181
00:15:22.685 --> 00:15:25.085
and I can't wait to, to get to share some of it with you.

182
00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.845
I'm gonna start, before we get to our,

183
00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:32.725
before we get to our handout, I'm gonna start

184
00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:36.165
with my favorite providential passage.

185
00:15:37.025 --> 00:15:38.485
And so if you have your bibles,

186
00:15:38.825 --> 00:15:40.245
I'm gonna ask you to open your Bibles.

187
00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:42.845
What Bible study? Yes.

188
00:15:43.705 --> 00:15:47.125
I'm gonna ask you to open your Bibles. Isaiah chapter 46.

189
00:15:48.275 --> 00:15:51.205
It's my favorite providential passage.

190
00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:53.325
Isaiah 46.

191
00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:59.565
If you have not underline, lined this verse, these passages,

192
00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:03.885
starred these passages, highlighted these passages.

193
00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:08.005
I would encourage you to do this, Isaiah 46

194
00:16:09.825 --> 00:16:11.565
verses nine through 11.

195
00:16:12.385 --> 00:16:14.165
And just in case you didn't bring your Bible,

196
00:16:15.025 --> 00:16:16.605
or if you're like me, you can't read

197
00:16:17.795 --> 00:16:20.525
your Bible anymore without glasses, uh,

198
00:16:20.565 --> 00:16:21.685
I put it on the screen for us.

199
00:16:22.235 --> 00:16:23.885
This is from the New American standard,

200
00:16:23.885 --> 00:16:26.565
nothing against the ESB, which we use here at church.

201
00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:29.685
I, I'm a big fan of the NASB.

202
00:16:29.865 --> 00:16:33.485
And so here is Isaiah 46, my favorite

203
00:16:34.205 --> 00:16:35.565
providential passage.

204
00:16:35.565 --> 00:16:36.565
Alright, here we go.

205
00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:42.885
Remember the former things long past out,

206
00:16:44.645 --> 00:16:46.165
remember the former things long pass?

207
00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:50.885
What do I do for a living? I love this verse already.

208
00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:53.365
I teach history, right?

209
00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:57.645
Remember the things from former, uh, former things,

210
00:16:57.795 --> 00:17:01.005
long pass for I am God

211
00:17:02.145 --> 00:17:03.525
and there is no other.

212
00:17:04.155 --> 00:17:07.485
Wait a minute. Why should we remember the things from the

213
00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.995
past, Brian?

214
00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:11.675
God? And there is no other.

215
00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:14.595
In other words, we remember things from the past

216
00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:18.955
to remind us of what God has done.

217
00:17:19.165 --> 00:17:23.435
Again, I love history. I am God.

218
00:17:23.435 --> 00:17:28.075
And there is no one like me declaring the end from the

219
00:17:28.075 --> 00:17:32.355
beginning and from ancient times, things which have not

220
00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:34.315
been done.

221
00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:36.875
I'm gonna keep going here in just a minute,

222
00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:39.355
but let that sink in just for a minute.

223
00:17:40.975 --> 00:17:43.715
God declares the end from the beginning

224
00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:47.555
and from ancient times, things which have not been done.

225
00:17:48.815 --> 00:17:50.125
Why is that profound?

226
00:17:55.155 --> 00:17:58.725
That is profound. Yes. Why? He's not bound by time.

227
00:17:59.115 --> 00:18:01.405
He's not bound by time he knows

228
00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:02.565
what's gonna happen in the end.

229
00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:06.405
And by the way, he knows what's gonna happen in the

230
00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:07.565
end while he's standing.

231
00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:08.685
Where At the beginning.

232
00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:11.165
At the beginning, I already know

233
00:18:11.165 --> 00:18:12.525
what the story is all about.

234
00:18:13.565 --> 00:18:16.045
'cause I wrote it. Alright?

235
00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:18.725
He, he's declaring the end from the beginning.

236
00:18:18.745 --> 00:18:21.885
He knows it all from ancient times,

237
00:18:21.945 --> 00:18:23.565
things which haven't even been done.

238
00:18:23.595 --> 00:18:27.405
That is, that's profound. Again, profound.

239
00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:30.525
But hold on, it's personal. Let's keep going.

240
00:18:32.265 --> 00:18:34.845
My purpose will be established

241
00:18:35.065 --> 00:18:37.925
and I will accomplish all my good pleasure

242
00:18:39.315 --> 00:18:42.085
calling a bird of prey from the east

243
00:18:42.305 --> 00:18:44.725
and the man of purpose from a far country.

244
00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:49.725
Truly, I have spoken. And truly I will bring it to pass.

245
00:18:51.075 --> 00:18:54.755
I have planned it. Surely I will do it.

246
00:18:57.535 --> 00:18:58.915
Do the events in your life

247
00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:02.955
and the events of the world around us happen by accident?

248
00:19:03.735 --> 00:19:05.955
No. How do we know that from this verse?

249
00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:10.275
How do we know that? What words? Gimme a word.

250
00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:16.515
I've planned it. He planned it. God has a plan. I'll do it.

251
00:19:17.065 --> 00:19:20.875
I'll do it. I'll accomplish, I'm gonna accomplish my plan.

252
00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:22.435
Whatever He's already,

253
00:19:22.575 --> 00:19:24.875
he already knows the plan he's gonna accomplish.

254
00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:25.835
He's gonna work it out

255
00:19:28.255 --> 00:19:30.355
my purposes.

256
00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:32.955
Nothing happens by accident.

257
00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:38.685
We're not victims of fate or chance or circumstance.

258
00:19:39.155 --> 00:19:42.165
He's got a purpose. And by the way,

259
00:19:42.225 --> 00:19:44.765
his purposes are good.

260
00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:49.325
Good. I'm gonna accomplish my pleasure, my purposes.

261
00:19:49.385 --> 00:19:52.125
And by the way, they're good. Mm-hmm. Okay.

262
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.565
We could spend the rest

263
00:19:54.565 --> 00:19:56.125
of the night on this passage right here.

264
00:19:56.355 --> 00:20:00.205
This is phenomenal, is profound,

265
00:20:00.585 --> 00:20:01.925
but it's personal.

266
00:20:02.465 --> 00:20:04.645
And that is the providence of God.

267
00:20:06.465 --> 00:20:08.965
Uh, we'll get into the pray from the e, the, the bird

268
00:20:08.965 --> 00:20:11.325
of pray from the East and the man of purpose and all that.

269
00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:12.405
What in the world does that mean?

270
00:20:12.575 --> 00:20:14.645
We'll get into that in the, in the study.

271
00:20:15.425 --> 00:20:18.405
But let's start with a word of prayer.

272
00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:21.965
Now that we've kind of set the stage here for our study.

273
00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:24.445
Lord, we're grateful for tonight.

274
00:20:25.105 --> 00:20:27.485
I'm grateful for these friends who have taken time

275
00:20:27.585 --> 00:20:31.965
to be here and to study and to learn.

276
00:20:33.105 --> 00:20:36.485
But it is much more than just learning about you.

277
00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:40.275
Our head can only, you know,

278
00:20:40.335 --> 00:20:42.315
our head can only keep so much knowledge.

279
00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:45.315
It's not about just learning about you.

280
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:48.485
It's about falling in love with you

281
00:20:48.785 --> 00:20:51.045
and learning to experience you.

282
00:20:52.025 --> 00:20:55.245
And so tonight, I pray that it's not just the, the facts

283
00:20:55.425 --> 00:20:56.965
of the doctrine of providence,

284
00:20:56.985 --> 00:20:59.645
but that you would click in our hearts

285
00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:02.165
and our minds to, to trust you more

286
00:21:03.035 --> 00:21:06.525
because of what we learn in this doctrine tonight.

287
00:21:07.665 --> 00:21:09.365
So thank you God. I pray you'll bless

288
00:21:09.365 --> 00:21:10.605
this time in Jesus' name.

289
00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:14.005
Amen. Alright,

290
00:21:15.345 --> 00:21:16.405
the providence of God.

291
00:21:16.555 --> 00:21:17.725
I've given you a handout.

292
00:21:17.825 --> 00:21:20.725
I'm gonna follow the handout as best I can here.

293
00:21:23.105 --> 00:21:26.805
Uh, but the handout is actually broken down into

294
00:21:27.315 --> 00:21:28.445
five sections.

295
00:21:28.535 --> 00:21:29.885
We're gonna talk about where,

296
00:21:30.035 --> 00:21:31.925
what is providence, where did it come from?

297
00:21:33.145 --> 00:21:37.645
And the, uh, systematic theology root

298
00:21:37.645 --> 00:21:41.485
and breaks providence into three sections, preservation,

299
00:21:41.835 --> 00:21:44.205
concurrence, and government.

300
00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:46.205
And then we're gonna apply it at the end.

301
00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:49.485
What are some applicant, how do we walk away from this

302
00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:50.685
study and apply this?

303
00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:53.205
This is kind of how this is all broken down.

304
00:21:53.265 --> 00:21:54.285
So let's jump right in.

305
00:21:54.285 --> 00:21:56.565
Is providence, even in the Bible, in the,

306
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.645
find the word providence in the Bible, uh,

307
00:21:59.645 --> 00:22:02.165
you will not find the word providence in the Bible.

308
00:22:02.265 --> 00:22:05.645
We made this word up to summarize

309
00:22:07.105 --> 00:22:10.765
the concept of God working all things for good.

310
00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:14.565
And so you, if you did a really quick search for providence,

311
00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:16.525
you're not gonna find, it's kinda like the word trinity.

312
00:22:16.725 --> 00:22:18.725
I wrote in the notes. It's kind of like the word trinity.

313
00:22:19.075 --> 00:22:22.525
It's not in the Bible, but the concept is, right?

314
00:22:23.065 --> 00:22:27.645
So, okay, we made this word up. And so, alright, what is it?

315
00:22:28.115 --> 00:22:31.405
It's from a Latin, two Latin words put together pro

316
00:22:31.545 --> 00:22:35.925
and theo, you should recognize Theo, we, we,

317
00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:37.925
we say video, right?

318
00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:42.365
Pro means before. And the day of video means to see.

319
00:22:42.505 --> 00:22:45.365
So put those two together, pro eo

320
00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:47.885
to see something before it happens.

321
00:22:49.225 --> 00:22:50.925
Uh, we might say foresight.

322
00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:56.325
We see before it happens, uh, very in a,

323
00:22:56.325 --> 00:22:58.085
in a very small degree, we see

324
00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:00.525
that there's a hundred percent chance of rain on Friday.

325
00:23:02.105 --> 00:23:03.805
So I should wear my rain jacket

326
00:23:03.905 --> 00:23:05.205
or I should carry my umbrella.

327
00:23:05.225 --> 00:23:06.765
That's foresight. Is

328
00:23:06.765 --> 00:23:08.845
that what's being described by providence?

329
00:23:08.985 --> 00:23:10.365
God can see that it's gonna rain.

330
00:23:11.265 --> 00:23:13.805
Uh, no, there's much more to it than that.

331
00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.845
But that's what probe AEO means.

332
00:23:16.585 --> 00:23:20.525
And so, Webster, I love to go to Webster's 1828 dictionary.

333
00:23:21.145 --> 00:23:22.805
Elders give me a hard time about this.

334
00:23:23.165 --> 00:23:26.645
'cause I, I love this dictionary. First American dictionary.

335
00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:28.805
And Noah Webster was a Christian.

336
00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:30.245
He writes the dictionary,

337
00:23:30.345 --> 00:23:32.525
the definitions from a biblical worldview.

338
00:23:33.395 --> 00:23:34.845
It's what?

339
00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:38.685
And he gives, uh, places in scripture find his definitions.

340
00:23:38.845 --> 00:23:41.885
I mean, okay, so why would you not use this dictionary?

341
00:23:42.705 --> 00:23:44.405
And, uh, they have an app. Mm-hmm.

342
00:23:45.265 --> 00:23:47.645
Uh, the 1820 eight's about that big.

343
00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:50.285
But you can, you have an app.

344
00:23:50.385 --> 00:23:52.325
You just, anyway, I use it every day in my,

345
00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:55.645
my just my quiet time run across a word.

346
00:23:55.645 --> 00:24:00.165
What does that mean? Anyway, so Webster's 1828,

347
00:24:00.165 --> 00:24:01.245
that's why I'm using this.

348
00:24:01.425 --> 00:24:03.045
The act of providing

349
00:24:03.145 --> 00:24:06.285
or preparing for future use, providing advance

350
00:24:07.275 --> 00:24:09.495
is a good definition of providence.

351
00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:13.855
Timely care. And remember foresight eo,

352
00:24:14.395 --> 00:24:17.095
he says active foresight.

353
00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:19.895
That's different than just, I can see

354
00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:21.375
that it's gonna rain on Friday.

355
00:24:21.595 --> 00:24:24.335
Active foresight means, uh,

356
00:24:24.595 --> 00:24:26.575
God doesn't just know what's gonna happen.

357
00:24:26.755 --> 00:24:29.415
He can bring it about the way he wants it to happen

358
00:24:29.675 --> 00:24:31.455
to meet his good pleasure.

359
00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:34.255
That's active foresight. You and I can't do that.

360
00:24:35.235 --> 00:24:37.575
Timely care, active foresight, accompanied

361
00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:41.455
with the procurement that the gathering of what is necessary

362
00:24:41.595 --> 00:24:45.095
for future use or with suitable preparation, okay?

363
00:24:45.095 --> 00:24:49.135
So provide an advance, even has a definition in theology.

364
00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:51.215
The care and superintendents, which

365
00:24:51.795 --> 00:24:54.375
God exercises over his creatures.

366
00:24:54.675 --> 00:24:58.185
And here's what I love about, uh, Noah Webster.

367
00:24:58.205 --> 00:24:59.705
He adds this little comment.

368
00:25:00.445 --> 00:25:02.545
He that acknowledges a creation

369
00:25:02.805 --> 00:25:04.425
and denies a providence,

370
00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:06.425
involves himself in a contradiction.

371
00:25:07.045 --> 00:25:09.825
The same power which caused a thing to exist.

372
00:25:10.285 --> 00:25:13.665
God is necessary to continue its existence.

373
00:25:14.895 --> 00:25:18.065
What are you gonna find? A dictionary that talks like that.

374
00:25:18.925 --> 00:25:20.785
That's why you use the 1828.

375
00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:24.705
But what he's saying is God has to continue to be there

376
00:25:24.765 --> 00:25:27.065
for us to continue to exist.

377
00:25:27.855 --> 00:25:30.825
Okay? So that's Webster's definition of providence.

378
00:25:30.825 --> 00:25:33.785
How does brodo and systematic theology define this?

379
00:25:34.765 --> 00:25:36.585
God is, uh, continually involved

380
00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:38.625
with all created things in such a way.

381
00:25:38.775 --> 00:25:40.545
Note the three sections.

382
00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:44.305
These are the three sections we're gonna break up this,

383
00:25:44.365 --> 00:25:45.385
uh, topic into.

384
00:25:45.805 --> 00:25:47.225
He keeps them existing

385
00:25:47.225 --> 00:25:49.585
and maintaining the properties with which he created them.

386
00:25:49.885 --> 00:25:53.745
So he keeps, he cooperates with created things

387
00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:56.825
and every action directing their properties to cause them

388
00:25:56.845 --> 00:25:58.145
to act as they do.

389
00:25:59.045 --> 00:26:01.065
So he keeps, he cooperates

390
00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:05.625
and then he directs, he directs them to fulfill

391
00:26:06.165 --> 00:26:07.345
his purposes.

392
00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:10.305
So what I've done in your notes here is we're gonna break

393
00:26:10.305 --> 00:26:13.105
this into, he keeps preservation.

394
00:26:13.445 --> 00:26:15.905
He cooperates, concurrence,

395
00:26:16.445 --> 00:26:18.545
he directs government.

396
00:26:18.685 --> 00:26:21.825
So that's the next three sections here. Alright?

397
00:26:21.845 --> 00:26:23.585
So let's dive into preservation.

398
00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:25.665
Uh, these are big words,

399
00:26:25.885 --> 00:26:29.905
but don't be scared of these words that the, uh, you know,

400
00:26:29.925 --> 00:26:32.145
the theologians have to use these big terms.

401
00:26:32.365 --> 00:26:33.665
But don't, don't be scared of these

402
00:26:33.895 --> 00:26:35.545
what is meant by preservation.

403
00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:39.345
Again, let's go back to Webster, the act of preserving

404
00:26:39.345 --> 00:26:42.625
or keeping preservation preserved to keep.

405
00:26:43.305 --> 00:26:44.805
And Gruden says the same thing.

406
00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:48.525
God keeps all created things existing,

407
00:26:48.925 --> 00:26:51.645
maintaining the properties with which he created them.

408
00:26:51.665 --> 00:26:54.485
So we're talking about God keeping, sustaining

409
00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:57.085
that which he has created.

410
00:26:57.905 --> 00:27:00.245
So where do we observe this in scripture?

411
00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:01.965
I've listed some verses there.

412
00:27:02.065 --> 00:27:03.725
Let me put 'em on the screen for you.

413
00:27:03.725 --> 00:27:05.205
We won't take time to look these up.

414
00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:08.915
But Nehemiah says, you are the Lord.

415
00:27:09.135 --> 00:27:11.435
You alone, you have made the heavens

416
00:27:11.435 --> 00:27:12.755
and the earth and all that is in them.

417
00:27:13.335 --> 00:27:16.675
And you preserve them all. You keep them all.

418
00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:18.555
You keep all of creation.

419
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:23.395
Acts 17, Paul says, for in him, we live and move and exist.

420
00:27:23.795 --> 00:27:27.755
Remember Noah Webster, we can't exist unless God exists.

421
00:27:27.945 --> 00:27:32.875
Okay? So in him, we exist, Colossians chapter one,

422
00:27:32.935 --> 00:27:34.355
he is before all things.

423
00:27:34.415 --> 00:27:38.115
And in him, all things hold together in holding,

424
00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:39.355
keeping present.

425
00:27:40.255 --> 00:27:43.915
And then in Hebrews chapter one, he upholds all things

426
00:27:44.135 --> 00:27:45.755
by the word of his power.

427
00:27:46.295 --> 00:27:49.595
So you keep seeing this, keep, preserve, uphold.

428
00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:53.355
That is the doctrine of preservation.

429
00:27:53.815 --> 00:27:56.875
That's a part of providence. Okay?

430
00:27:57.055 --> 00:27:59.955
So, uh, preservation, very simple.

431
00:28:01.295 --> 00:28:04.755
God has to continue to sustain what he's created.

432
00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:09.435
Otherwise, we would all cease to exist. It's pretty simple.

433
00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:13.435
This is much more profound concurrence.

434
00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:17.515
Here's your big word for the day, concurrence.

435
00:28:18.095 --> 00:28:19.955
But you need to add this to your vocabulary

436
00:28:19.955 --> 00:28:21.515
because this is phenomenal.

437
00:28:22.345 --> 00:28:24.475
What in the world is concurrence?

438
00:28:25.005 --> 00:28:26.635
Again, let's go back to Wester.

439
00:28:27.385 --> 00:28:28.755
It's a combination of events.

440
00:28:28.855 --> 00:28:30.635
He says circumstances or events,

441
00:28:30.855 --> 00:28:32.635
or excuse me, agents or events.

442
00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:35.755
When, when two or more things come together,

443
00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:38.875
like this room right here where we have 30 people,

444
00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:42.515
40 people in here, you all were going your various

445
00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:43.755
directions today.

446
00:28:43.895 --> 00:28:47.435
But at six 15, we all came together in this room.

447
00:28:47.905 --> 00:28:51.555
Concurrence took place for all of us to sit in this class.

448
00:28:52.145 --> 00:28:55.915
However, there's much more to it than that.

449
00:28:56.465 --> 00:28:58.875
Concurrence. Two or more things working together.

450
00:28:58.895 --> 00:29:00.355
Here's how Grham says it.

451
00:29:01.255 --> 00:29:04.475
God cooperates with created things in every action,

452
00:29:05.425 --> 00:29:09.635
directing their distinctive properties to cause keyword,

453
00:29:10.325 --> 00:29:14.875
cause them to act as they do cause God causes.

454
00:29:15.985 --> 00:29:19.915
Okay? But we also cause things.

455
00:29:20.815 --> 00:29:23.235
So there's, you are causing things

456
00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:24.755
and God is causing things.

457
00:29:25.445 --> 00:29:28.555
We're both causing things. That's concurrence.

458
00:29:29.105 --> 00:29:32.035
They're both a combination of

459
00:29:32.675 --> 00:29:34.355
cau causation that's happening here.

460
00:29:34.895 --> 00:29:39.635
So, okay, God is the primary cause, Perdu says,

461
00:29:40.375 --> 00:29:43.765
and his creatures that's us, are the secondary cause

462
00:29:44.785 --> 00:29:46.805
You make decisions all day long,

463
00:29:48.265 --> 00:29:52.605
but God somehow causes your decisions to align

464
00:29:52.605 --> 00:29:53.765
with his purposes.

465
00:29:53.765 --> 00:29:56.605
That again, profound. How does he do that?

466
00:29:57.155 --> 00:30:00.645
He's got to be sovereign in control

467
00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.885
of everything to do that.

468
00:30:01.885 --> 00:30:03.325
That's why he's gone. And we're not,

469
00:30:04.195 --> 00:30:06.445
both agents work simultaneously.

470
00:30:07.475 --> 00:30:09.805
Okay? So where do we see examples

471
00:30:09.805 --> 00:30:11.085
of concurrence in scripture?

472
00:30:11.115 --> 00:30:12.445
This is where it really gets spun.

473
00:30:13.185 --> 00:30:14.845
Uh, you can talk about these things,

474
00:30:14.945 --> 00:30:16.965
but let's find 'em in the Bible.

475
00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:18.885
How, how do we see these things in the Bible?

476
00:30:19.705 --> 00:30:22.565
And, uh, grham lists five ways

477
00:30:22.715 --> 00:30:26.405
that we see concurrence in scripture creation,

478
00:30:26.545 --> 00:30:27.605
the animals random

479
00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:30.565
or chance events, nations and individuals.

480
00:30:31.105 --> 00:30:33.285
I'd like to kind of take these one by one

481
00:30:33.285 --> 00:30:35.725
and I want to ask you for some examples.

482
00:30:35.785 --> 00:30:38.245
Here's where you're gonna get to participate.

483
00:30:39.695 --> 00:30:42.205
Where do we see concurrence in scripture creation?

484
00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:45.885
So let's just think creation here for a minute.

485
00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:47.365
I wrote there for you.

486
00:30:47.555 --> 00:30:50.965
Snow, rain, lightning, wind, grass, flowers.

487
00:30:51.065 --> 00:30:53.045
You get creation things he's created.

488
00:30:54.145 --> 00:30:57.765
Uh, Matthew five, your father in heaven causes the son

489
00:30:57.785 --> 00:31:00.085
to rise on the evil in the good causes.

490
00:31:01.345 --> 00:31:04.245
He created the son to rise and, and set on its own,

491
00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:08.045
but he's also causing it to rise

492
00:31:08.185 --> 00:31:09.845
and set on its own concurrence.

493
00:31:10.825 --> 00:31:13.725
He also sends rain on the righteous in the unrighteous.

494
00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:18.085
But wait, isn't there this process of evaporation

495
00:31:18.145 --> 00:31:20.285
and, and the water cycle.

496
00:31:20.485 --> 00:31:22.685
I mean, he made it that way, yes,

497
00:31:23.625 --> 00:31:25.805
but he can say, Hey, go rain over there.

498
00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:27.645
Right? He sends rain.

499
00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:31.125
So concurrence, where do we see an example in scripture?

500
00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:33.365
I'm sure you may be thinking about it already,

501
00:31:33.815 --> 00:31:36.045
where God exhibits this in creation.

502
00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:38.565
His, uh, sovereignty over creation.

503
00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:39.885
This happens all over the Bible.

504
00:31:39.945 --> 00:31:42.205
If you're paying attention to scripture,

505
00:31:42.315 --> 00:31:43.445
this happens all the time.

506
00:31:45.045 --> 00:31:48.025
The flood. Okay, very good. Made the sun stand still.

507
00:31:48.405 --> 00:31:51.145
He made the sun stand still during a battle.

508
00:31:51.285 --> 00:31:55.825
So win the battle, the big fish. Swallow the big fish.

509
00:31:56.095 --> 00:31:59.065
Yeah, fish. Fish eat things that are in front of them.

510
00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:01.105
Fish with money in mouth.

511
00:32:01.205 --> 00:32:03.985
But God said, Hey fish, go over there and swallow that guy.

512
00:32:04.615 --> 00:32:07.785
Okay, so there's concurrence. I'm sorry, go ahead. David.

513
00:32:07.855 --> 00:32:11.265
Fish with money in the mouth. Yeah, with money.

514
00:32:11.915 --> 00:32:14.385
Jesus said, uh, hey, it's starting to pay our taxes.

515
00:32:14.435 --> 00:32:15.785
Would you go down and catch a fish?

516
00:32:16.005 --> 00:32:17.585
My taxes are gonna be in his mouth.

517
00:32:18.765 --> 00:32:20.825
And so the disciples go down and get the fish.

518
00:32:20.825 --> 00:32:22.665
Sure enough, there's a coin in there for his taxes.

519
00:32:23.265 --> 00:32:27.385
Wouldn't that be nice? Uh, that's, I don't know.

520
00:32:27.785 --> 00:32:30.265
I can't say that's cheating because he's the son of God.

521
00:32:32.175 --> 00:32:34.105
That doesn't seem fair. You know,

522
00:32:34.405 --> 00:32:36.385
he walked on water, he walks on water.

523
00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:39.105
What does he do to the storm? It's, it's storming.

524
00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:41.885
And he says, cease be still.

525
00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:45.165
H Okay, so we see this all in scripture.

526
00:32:45.825 --> 00:32:49.765
Uh, creation just continues to, to, to, to go.

527
00:32:49.905 --> 00:32:51.685
But he also can't control it.

528
00:32:51.915 --> 00:32:53.565
Concurrence, one

529
00:32:53.565 --> 00:32:55.405
of my favorites is the tree that he withers.

530
00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:58.805
You know what I'm talking about? Cursed.

531
00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:01.125
You're, there's nothing to eat on this tree.

532
00:33:01.795 --> 00:33:04.005
What good are you? And he curses the tree and it die.

533
00:33:04.205 --> 00:33:07.245
I mean, uh, why is that my, one of my favorites?

534
00:33:08.515 --> 00:33:11.205
There's a lot to that story, but, okay, you get the idea.

535
00:33:12.755 --> 00:33:15.805
Animals, uh, look at the birds of the air.

536
00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:18.565
They don't sow or reap or gathering at the barns,

537
00:33:18.565 --> 00:33:20.645
and yet your heavenly father feeds them.

538
00:33:21.445 --> 00:33:24.045
Remember, this is personal. We got birds everywhere,

539
00:33:24.265 --> 00:33:26.205
but God is in the details.

540
00:33:26.785 --> 00:33:27.925
Hey birds, there's, uh,

541
00:33:28.085 --> 00:33:29.365
somebody spilled a bunch of stuff over here.

542
00:33:29.365 --> 00:33:32.885
Why don't you eat it? Concurrence. Okay?

543
00:33:32.905 --> 00:33:34.365
So this is, this is amazing.

544
00:33:34.735 --> 00:33:37.285
Where do you see God using animals?

545
00:33:39.525 --> 00:33:41.985
We said the big fish. Daniel and the lions.

546
00:33:42.005 --> 00:33:43.465
Daniel and the lions den.

547
00:33:43.715 --> 00:33:45.505
Lions heat people, especially when they're hungry.

548
00:33:46.295 --> 00:33:49.585
BA's hungry BA's donkeys speaking through the donkey.

549
00:33:49.855 --> 00:33:54.465
Yeah, Elijah and MCC crows. The crows bringing Elijah food.

550
00:33:55.205 --> 00:33:58.465
The bears and the bears, yeah. Sick them.

551
00:33:58.665 --> 00:34:02.985
I mean, yeah, there's some amazing stories about animals

552
00:34:03.045 --> 00:34:06.025
and how God orchestrates these animals.

553
00:34:06.325 --> 00:34:08.505
Uh, it's really fascinating when you think about it.

554
00:34:09.765 --> 00:34:12.265
He has control over his creation

555
00:34:12.485 --> 00:34:15.585
and he's using animals, just do animal things.

556
00:34:15.765 --> 00:34:19.825
But he is able to, to use them to do his good bid.

557
00:34:19.825 --> 00:34:21.145
What, what about the flood?

558
00:34:22.685 --> 00:34:27.025
Uh, animals just showed up at the a.

559
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:31.625
Wait a minute, what, why twos, how's he doing that?

560
00:34:33.115 --> 00:34:35.735
And just enough to build the arc in the space they have.

561
00:34:35.935 --> 00:34:40.135
I mean, okay, this is profound, but this is amazing.

562
00:34:41.475 --> 00:34:44.335
Uh, random or chance events.

563
00:34:44.675 --> 00:34:48.535
You know, God is in control of random or chance events.

564
00:34:50.075 --> 00:34:51.575
You need to be really careful.

565
00:34:52.085 --> 00:34:55.375
I've been careful when I learned this at age 23.

566
00:34:55.515 --> 00:35:00.015
One of the things RC Spro drilled into my brain was,

567
00:35:01.795 --> 00:35:03.585
don't use the word luck.

568
00:35:05.735 --> 00:35:08.705
That was lucky, man.

569
00:35:08.905 --> 00:35:13.625
I, I'm having a string of bad luck, or that was an accident

570
00:35:14.125 --> 00:35:15.305
or a coincidence.

571
00:35:16.605 --> 00:35:20.105
Uh, you gotta eliminate those things from your, now I know

572
00:35:20.105 --> 00:35:21.105
what we mean by that.

573
00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:23.385
Nobody, you know, we,

574
00:35:23.385 --> 00:35:24.705
we don't really mean a whole lot by that.

575
00:35:24.725 --> 00:35:25.985
But sometimes some people do.

576
00:35:27.215 --> 00:35:29.825
They believe in luck or whatever happen stands.

577
00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:34.305
Uh, if you believe that God is in control of all things

578
00:35:34.525 --> 00:35:36.225
and has a purpose for everything,

579
00:35:36.225 --> 00:35:38.365
there's no no such thing as luck.

580
00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:42.325
There's no such thing as an accident.

581
00:35:43.385 --> 00:35:47.045
Ooh, we just had an accident. We know what that means.

582
00:35:47.385 --> 00:35:49.205
We didn't mean to do that. It was unplanned,

583
00:35:49.315 --> 00:35:51.045
unplanned from our end.

584
00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:53.565
It was an accident from his end.

585
00:35:54.515 --> 00:35:57.685
There's no accident that, okay, this,

586
00:35:59.195 --> 00:36:00.645
this will blow your mind.

587
00:36:00.655 --> 00:36:01.885
Right? This is profound.

588
00:36:03.225 --> 00:36:05.245
Now, what's the most random thing we could do?

589
00:36:05.345 --> 00:36:09.415
Is take a paradise, roll 'em across the floor,

590
00:36:11.455 --> 00:36:13.995
and then trust whatever the dice says

591
00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:17.395
to be a decision to be made.

592
00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:19.035
And let's just say we have a big decision.

593
00:36:19.135 --> 00:36:23.715
Should we change the next apostle?

594
00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.235
Choose the next apostle.

595
00:36:28.615 --> 00:36:30.675
The disciples have Juda has killed himself.

596
00:36:30.675 --> 00:36:33.855
We gotta replace him. How are we gonna cheat?

597
00:36:33.915 --> 00:36:36.375
We put some guys up here, the boat,

598
00:36:38.275 --> 00:36:39.455
and they picked Mattias.

599
00:36:41.005 --> 00:36:45.895
Wait, how? What? Yeah. Proverbs says, the lot is cast.

600
00:36:45.995 --> 00:36:47.615
We don't necessarily use lots,

601
00:36:47.615 --> 00:36:48.775
but in Old Testament they did.

602
00:36:49.195 --> 00:36:52.695
We use dice. You can cast the dice,

603
00:36:52.715 --> 00:36:54.255
but every decision's from the Lord.

604
00:36:55.085 --> 00:36:58.815
What? There's no such thing as luck.

605
00:36:59.955 --> 00:37:02.935
That's crazy. Remember when, uh, Joshua

606
00:37:03.195 --> 00:37:05.175
and the Israelites attacks Jericho

607
00:37:05.175 --> 00:37:06.855
and they weren't supposed to take anything from Jericho.

608
00:37:06.945 --> 00:37:08.535
Haken take something from Jericho

609
00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:10.815
and they lose the next battle.

610
00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:13.335
And Josh was like, what in the world's going on here?

611
00:37:14.635 --> 00:37:17.975
Who did it? Nobody would say anything. So what did they do?

612
00:37:17.975 --> 00:37:19.015
They brought out the lots.

613
00:37:20.395 --> 00:37:23.255
Not that tribe next, not that tribe next.

614
00:37:24.315 --> 00:37:25.575
And they got all the way down to eighth.

615
00:37:27.165 --> 00:37:31.895
What that is, that's God's providence. This is crazy.

616
00:37:32.675 --> 00:37:35.935
How did Saul become king? They chose the different tribes.

617
00:37:35.935 --> 00:37:38.415
Came all the way down to King. Saul. Jonah.

618
00:37:39.255 --> 00:37:41.055
Remember Jonah, who's causing this storm?

619
00:37:41.145 --> 00:37:43.255
Let's cast lots and find out. Oh, it's Jonah.

620
00:37:44.635 --> 00:37:46.215
He says, yeah, throw me overboard.

621
00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:50.735
Okay, so this, this is, this is crazy.

622
00:37:51.365 --> 00:37:53.335
Yeah, the dice are cast

623
00:37:53.515 --> 00:37:55.295
and yet every decision is from the Lord.

624
00:37:55.315 --> 00:37:57.215
By the way, these aren't just fun Bible stories.

625
00:37:58.315 --> 00:37:59.735
Uh, Christopher Columbus

626
00:38:01.105 --> 00:38:03.085
and his journals, they had a big storm

627
00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:04.605
Who's causing this storm?

628
00:38:04.995 --> 00:38:08.525
This is in the 14 hundreds. Guess what they did?

629
00:38:10.105 --> 00:38:14.125
It came down to him. He said, no, something's wrong here.

630
00:38:14.535 --> 00:38:18.365
We'll do this tomorrow. Next day came down

631
00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:19.525
to him causing the storm.

632
00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:25.445
We do this tomorrow. Three times came down to him.

633
00:38:25.515 --> 00:38:28.525
What are the chances? What are the odds of that one

634
00:38:28.525 --> 00:38:30.405
of us needs to go to Vegas, right?

635
00:38:31.145 --> 00:38:32.165
Uh, no.

636
00:38:32.465 --> 00:38:36.405
God is in control even of these random events.

637
00:38:36.405 --> 00:38:37.645
There's no such thing as random.

638
00:38:38.925 --> 00:38:40.525
I, uh, coached volleyball for many years.

639
00:38:40.525 --> 00:38:41.645
Some of you heard this story.

640
00:38:42.665 --> 00:38:44.685
And, uh, this other coach would always come up

641
00:38:44.685 --> 00:38:46.085
before the game and say, good luck.

642
00:38:47.285 --> 00:38:48.805
I mean, good providence. You're not.

643
00:38:49.725 --> 00:38:52.205
'cause I know y'all don't believe in luck around here.

644
00:38:53.025 --> 00:38:54.565
And he was always giving me a hard time,

645
00:38:55.015 --> 00:38:56.045
which I, that's fine.

646
00:38:56.245 --> 00:38:58.445
'cause we always beat his team. Uh,

647
00:38:58.585 --> 00:39:00.685
but anyway, I he's right.

648
00:39:00.825 --> 00:39:02.805
We don't believe in luck. I don't believe in luck.

649
00:39:02.895 --> 00:39:07.085
God's in control even of random and chance events, nations.

650
00:39:07.085 --> 00:39:08.325
He's got control of nations.

651
00:39:08.365 --> 00:39:12.445
I mean, we're talking millions of people. You bet he is.

652
00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:14.725
He made from one man every nation

653
00:39:15.705 --> 00:39:18.165
to live on the earth and watch this.

654
00:39:18.465 --> 00:39:22.845
He determined their time. When will they rise?

655
00:39:23.115 --> 00:39:26.045
When will they fall? Where are the Romans today?

656
00:39:28.245 --> 00:39:30.445
Thousand years. And when they're gone.

657
00:39:30.955 --> 00:39:34.085
Alright, where are the Greeks today? Right?

658
00:39:34.865 --> 00:39:36.125
Uh, he determines their times.

659
00:39:36.265 --> 00:39:39.525
And by the way, their boundaries, Persians,

660
00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:41.085
you can go all this far.

661
00:39:41.085 --> 00:39:44.085
And then they invaded, uh, Europe three times.

662
00:39:44.665 --> 00:39:47.285
And they, they did not succeed. God said, this is it.

663
00:39:47.945 --> 00:39:52.765
No, no, past this record. God's in control of nations.

664
00:39:53.235 --> 00:39:55.525
Even says the king's heart is in my hand.

665
00:39:55.765 --> 00:39:57.765
I can turn it like rivers of water.

666
00:39:59.285 --> 00:40:00.945
So nations, no big deal.

667
00:40:01.205 --> 00:40:03.505
And uh, Daniel, he says, nations are like a drop

668
00:40:03.505 --> 00:40:06.505
of buck in a bucket, drop of water in a bucket.

669
00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:10.705
No problem has God in control of the United States.

670
00:40:13.135 --> 00:40:14.665
He's in control of all nations.

671
00:40:15.565 --> 00:40:17.705
Uh, one day people are gonna say, man,

672
00:40:17.845 --> 00:40:20.145
the United States, where is it?

673
00:40:20.955 --> 00:40:24.345
Right? He, when he's done with us, he's in control.

674
00:40:25.365 --> 00:40:26.705
He determines the time.

675
00:40:27.685 --> 00:40:30.905
So yes, uh, he is sovereign over these things.

676
00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:33.785
This is concurrence. What about individuals?

677
00:40:33.785 --> 00:40:37.365
Now we're getting personal man may plan his way,

678
00:40:38.465 --> 00:40:41.085
but the Lord directs his steps.

679
00:40:41.625 --> 00:40:44.725
How is that an example of concurrence? Jesus.

680
00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:49.085
Judas, we'll get to Ju Yeah, very good Judas.

681
00:40:49.295 --> 00:40:53.085
We'll get to Judas in just a second from that verse.

682
00:40:53.185 --> 00:40:58.005
How do you see concurrence? It's a combination.

683
00:40:58.635 --> 00:41:01.285
He's not saying don't plan, but we do make a plan.

684
00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:02.965
We do plan. But ultimately he

685
00:41:02.985 --> 00:41:04.765
steers, he steers how that happens.

686
00:41:07.025 --> 00:41:09.805
We have a, we've been keeping up with all the football games

687
00:41:09.805 --> 00:41:11.645
that are being changed on Friday

688
00:41:12.275 --> 00:41:15.325
because the weather's coming in,

689
00:41:16.345 --> 00:41:17.445
man may plan his way.

690
00:41:19.945 --> 00:41:21.525
God brings the rain.

691
00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:26.245
And so now we've gotta change our plans. Concurrence.

692
00:41:26.305 --> 00:41:27.485
We plan all day long,

693
00:41:27.625 --> 00:41:31.765
but God is the one who orchestrates your steps.

694
00:41:32.755 --> 00:41:36.085
Alright, concurrence, this is, uh, this is phenomenal.

695
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:37.445
Now, question.

696
00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:40.045
And you might be thinking, if God's in control

697
00:41:40.985 --> 00:41:45.005
of everything, including me, are my choices real?

698
00:41:45.265 --> 00:41:46.725
Do my choices really matter?

699
00:41:47.665 --> 00:41:51.565
And the answer to that is obviously yes.

700
00:41:52.585 --> 00:41:54.125
You go jump off a tall building,

701
00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:58.045
you're gonna find out your choices matter.

702
00:41:58.595 --> 00:42:00.085
Okay? You run out of the highway

703
00:42:01.265 --> 00:42:03.965
and slap your choices matter.

704
00:42:04.745 --> 00:42:06.525
So now, wait a minute. My choices matter.

705
00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:08.245
My choices have consequences.

706
00:42:09.505 --> 00:42:14.005
Yes, but God's still in control

707
00:42:14.065 --> 00:42:18.965
and he uses my choices, all of our choices to weave

708
00:42:19.825 --> 00:42:21.525
and work his purposes.

709
00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:24.485
That is that again, that's profound.

710
00:42:26.025 --> 00:42:27.325
Our choices do matter.

711
00:42:28.185 --> 00:42:30.805
Now, a question we may al also also get

712
00:42:30.905 --> 00:42:32.125
is do we have free will?

713
00:42:33.185 --> 00:42:37.005
Uh, do we, do we really have free will if God is in control?

714
00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:40.525
Good question. Uh,

715
00:42:41.635 --> 00:42:43.845
free should be in quotation marks there.

716
00:42:44.365 --> 00:42:47.405
'cause we really, we are free. You get to make choices.

717
00:42:47.585 --> 00:42:49.325
You made a thousand choices today,

718
00:42:50.465 --> 00:42:52.245
but your will is really not free.

719
00:42:52.305 --> 00:42:56.485
You can't determine to do anything outside

720
00:42:56.485 --> 00:42:59.645
of God's control, right?

721
00:43:00.425 --> 00:43:02.325
Uh, there's a, there's a universe

722
00:43:02.345 --> 00:43:04.725
and you can't act outside of that universe.

723
00:43:04.905 --> 00:43:08.565
You, you, you're bound by his sovereignty.

724
00:43:09.185 --> 00:43:12.485
So you're really not free and you're a sinner at heart.

725
00:43:12.745 --> 00:43:14.405
You're, the Bible tells us

726
00:43:14.405 --> 00:43:17.125
that we are enslaved before Christ.

727
00:43:17.305 --> 00:43:18.605
We are enslaved to sin.

728
00:43:18.605 --> 00:43:20.365
You're really, your will is not free.

729
00:43:20.365 --> 00:43:22.645
It's bound by your simple nature.

730
00:43:23.525 --> 00:43:26.465
So free really should be in quotation mark there.

731
00:43:26.485 --> 00:43:28.385
But yes, you and I of any

732
00:43:28.385 --> 00:43:31.345
of the creatures God has created are the most free,

733
00:43:31.995 --> 00:43:33.745
given the most freedom to do

734
00:43:34.705 --> 00:43:36.105
whatever we want to do in a day.

735
00:43:36.125 --> 00:43:37.785
Nobody told you what to do today.

736
00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:41.785
Well, maybe your boss, you have to go to work, right?

737
00:43:41.845 --> 00:43:44.105
Or your spouse. You gotta do these errands.

738
00:43:45.545 --> 00:43:47.025
Somebody may have told you what to do today,

739
00:43:47.025 --> 00:43:49.865
but most of us get to decide what to do in a day.

740
00:43:51.315 --> 00:43:52.415
You have free will,

741
00:43:52.635 --> 00:43:56.135
but it's not free in the sense that I can do anything I want

742
00:43:57.125 --> 00:43:58.535
outside of God's control.

743
00:43:58.605 --> 00:44:00.575
That that's not, you don't have that type of freedom.

744
00:44:01.915 --> 00:44:03.815
Here's how RC Spro says it in

745
00:44:03.815 --> 00:44:05.855
that video I was telling you about earlier.

746
00:44:06.315 --> 00:44:08.015
If God's not in control of all things,

747
00:44:08.085 --> 00:44:09.415
then he's not sovereign.

748
00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:12.145
He's not sovereign, then he's not God.

749
00:44:13.605 --> 00:44:17.105
And if our free will can trump divine providence,

750
00:44:17.105 --> 00:44:18.785
then who's ultimately God, we are,

751
00:44:21.055 --> 00:44:23.265
that conclusion is unacceptable to anyone

752
00:44:23.265 --> 00:44:24.425
with a biblical worldview.

753
00:44:24.485 --> 00:44:28.585
In other words, if, if our will, if God doesn't know,

754
00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:30.945
God's sitting up there going, what's he gonna do today?

755
00:44:32.185 --> 00:44:34.125
You're really in charge and not him.

756
00:44:34.545 --> 00:44:38.245
That's what's gonna say divine providence does not

757
00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:39.325
destroy our freedom.

758
00:44:39.685 --> 00:44:42.285
RC says, rather divine providence takes

759
00:44:42.285 --> 00:44:43.365
our freedom into account.

760
00:44:44.065 --> 00:44:46.285
And the infinite wisdom of God sets our course

761
00:44:46.285 --> 00:44:47.325
to fulfill his will.

762
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:54.725
Anybody understand that? No, but we know it's true.

763
00:44:55.755 --> 00:44:58.485
Okay, so the million dollar question then, what about evil?

764
00:44:59.715 --> 00:45:02.285
What about evil? Uh, good question.

765
00:45:03.235 --> 00:45:06.165
This is, uh, the million dollar question.

766
00:45:06.225 --> 00:45:08.805
You know, the atheist always likes to throw out Christians.

767
00:45:09.945 --> 00:45:11.445
Uh, there's so much evil in the world.

768
00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:12.645
How can God be in control?

769
00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:17.225
Okay, keep in mind we have dual agents here.

770
00:45:17.355 --> 00:45:20.225
God's a cause and a man's a cause.

771
00:45:21.005 --> 00:45:23.865
And God is not responsible for evil.

772
00:45:23.965 --> 00:45:28.025
The Bible says he he can't do anything that's,

773
00:45:28.765 --> 00:45:30.105
uh, not good.

774
00:45:30.815 --> 00:45:35.025
Good is who he is, but man is responsible for evil.

775
00:45:35.805 --> 00:45:38.985
And, uh, God, though we know from scripture allows

776
00:45:39.245 --> 00:45:43.665
or ordains evil to occur, but he still sovereign over it.

777
00:45:44.365 --> 00:45:45.945
Now, this is, this is really tough

778
00:45:45.945 --> 00:45:47.865
because man can do some wicked things

779
00:45:48.685 --> 00:45:51.585
and yet God still comes in sovereign over it.

780
00:45:51.585 --> 00:45:52.825
That's, that's amazing.

781
00:45:53.645 --> 00:45:57.745
So he's able to use evil for his good purposes.

782
00:45:58.575 --> 00:46:00.625
That you just take those three right there

783
00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:02.145
and think on those three for a little bit.

784
00:46:02.285 --> 00:46:06.325
And, and that is some, that's some rich stuff right there.

785
00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:09.205
But we know scripturally that this is true.

786
00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:14.025
Uh, Joseph is a perfect example.

787
00:46:14.165 --> 00:46:16.105
That's probably my favorite story when

788
00:46:16.105 --> 00:46:17.185
it comes to Providence.

789
00:46:18.045 --> 00:46:22.025
Uh, his brothers just happened

790
00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:25.785
to sell into Egypt, into slavery.

791
00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:30.665
He just happened to end up in Potiphar's house whose

792
00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:33.265
wife just happened to come on to him.

793
00:46:33.285 --> 00:46:34.745
So he just happened to flee.

794
00:46:34.805 --> 00:46:36.145
So he just happened to get arrested

795
00:46:36.145 --> 00:46:37.585
and just happened to get thrown into prison.

796
00:46:38.865 --> 00:46:41.245
And he just happened to run into two guys working

797
00:46:41.505 --> 00:46:42.645
for Pharaoh and,

798
00:46:43.345 --> 00:46:46.005
and just happened to interpret their dreams.

799
00:46:46.225 --> 00:46:49.645
And then he ends up, just happened to interpret

800
00:46:50.675 --> 00:46:52.925
Pharaoh's dreams and just happened

801
00:46:52.925 --> 00:46:54.965
to save the whole world from a family.

802
00:46:56.585 --> 00:46:59.885
That's a whole lot of bad things that just, he had a lot

803
00:46:59.885 --> 00:47:01.325
of bad luck there, didn't he?

804
00:47:02.385 --> 00:47:04.525
But we know at the end of Genesis,

805
00:47:06.985 --> 00:47:09.965
he tells his brothers what you meant for evil against me.

806
00:47:10.065 --> 00:47:13.725
God meant for good. These guys are

807
00:47:13.725 --> 00:47:15.245
responsible for the things they did.

808
00:47:16.305 --> 00:47:20.205
And Nick, God was able to use that and turn into good.

809
00:47:20.235 --> 00:47:24.485
That, that's just unbelievable. Pharaoh was evil.

810
00:47:24.585 --> 00:47:26.725
He did evil things to the Israelites.

811
00:47:27.505 --> 00:47:30.445
And God told Moses to tell Pharaoh, for this reason,

812
00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:32.005
I've allowed you to remain.

813
00:47:32.845 --> 00:47:35.165
I allowed evil to remain,

814
00:47:36.055 --> 00:47:38.035
to show you my power.

815
00:47:38.375 --> 00:47:39.595
I'm gonna bring down Egypt

816
00:47:40.375 --> 00:47:42.275
to proclaim my name through all the earth.

817
00:47:42.585 --> 00:47:43.915
Everybody's gonna know my name

818
00:47:43.915 --> 00:47:47.475
because of you, Pharaoh, so evil.

819
00:47:48.015 --> 00:47:50.275
You can exist. But God is in control.

820
00:47:51.595 --> 00:47:55.935
Joe, the Lord gave the Lord took away everything from Joe,

821
00:47:55.935 --> 00:47:57.255
blessed it be the name of the Lord.

822
00:47:57.255 --> 00:48:00.615
He says through all this Job 1 22, he did not sin

823
00:48:00.615 --> 00:48:01.655
and did not blame God.

824
00:48:02.485 --> 00:48:06.655
Evil men do evil things, but he doesn't blame God.

825
00:48:07.555 --> 00:48:08.815
God does not do evil.

826
00:48:09.915 --> 00:48:12.135
Uh, so we're accountable for our decisions.

827
00:48:12.285 --> 00:48:14.455
Evil is, uh, something we're responsible

828
00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:16.375
of, responsible for.

829
00:48:16.885 --> 00:48:20.375
Luke 22, the son of man will go as it has been determined,

830
00:48:20.395 --> 00:48:24.215
but woe to the man by whom he is betrayed.

831
00:48:24.855 --> 00:48:26.575
Somebody point out the concurrence there.

832
00:48:27.915 --> 00:48:30.895
If it wasn't for Judas, Jesus would possibly

833
00:48:30.895 --> 00:48:31.895
Die. If

834
00:48:31.895 --> 00:48:34.615
it wasn't for Judas, you wouldn't have been arrested

835
00:48:35.315 --> 00:48:37.255
and you wouldn't end up dying on the cross.

836
00:48:37.515 --> 00:48:40.545
She said, good. What's the concurrence though?

837
00:48:41.045 --> 00:48:43.305
It concurrence is it was determined.

838
00:48:43.605 --> 00:48:46.785
It was determined Who determined it. God did.

839
00:48:47.605 --> 00:48:51.025
But woe to the man who betrays him.

840
00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:55.705
In other words, Judas is responsible for his own decisions.

841
00:48:56.735 --> 00:48:59.185
This is okay, this is concurrence. This is evil.

842
00:48:59.285 --> 00:49:00.505
How God uses evil.

843
00:49:01.565 --> 00:49:06.345
Ran across a poem long time ago, just is phenomenal

844
00:49:07.245 --> 00:49:10.025
by a pastor, a theologian named Arthur Pearson.

845
00:49:10.605 --> 00:49:12.785
And, uh, it's on the left hand margin there.

846
00:49:12.865 --> 00:49:15.865
I know it's very small. Uh, so I put it on the screen.

847
00:49:17.325 --> 00:49:19.705
Listen to these words. This is, this is excellent.

848
00:49:20.455 --> 00:49:23.585
Back of all that foes had plotted behind all

849
00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:26.585
that foes had plotted back of all that saints have planned

850
00:49:27.375 --> 00:49:29.025
back of schemes by men

851
00:49:29.205 --> 00:49:31.825
or demons, moves a higher hidden hand.

852
00:49:32.685 --> 00:49:35.905
In other words, behind all these things, God is working.

853
00:49:37.535 --> 00:49:38.625
Warp and woo,

854
00:49:39.605 --> 00:49:42.865
are heavens making time out warping what in the world.

855
00:49:44.015 --> 00:49:48.185
This is, uh, when somebody is knitting warping woo warping,

856
00:49:48.205 --> 00:49:49.345
woo, warping woo.

857
00:49:49.735 --> 00:49:53.825
When you make a pattern warping, woo, that's a, those are,

858
00:49:54.365 --> 00:49:56.225
that's a terminology that's being used here.

859
00:49:56.325 --> 00:50:00.385
God is weaving, making something from our

860
00:50:01.525 --> 00:50:02.865
events, from our lives.

861
00:50:03.015 --> 00:50:04.505
Warping move for heaven's making.

862
00:50:04.655 --> 00:50:06.185
He's making a pattern out of us.

863
00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:09.545
All the pattern good and wise, though on earth,

864
00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:10.985
side off perplexing.

865
00:50:10.985 --> 00:50:14.985
We don't understand clear and right to heavenly eyes.

866
00:50:16.195 --> 00:50:20.175
All Earth's agents act with freedom. We have free will.

867
00:50:21.055 --> 00:50:24.455
Choosing whether love or hate faith in God and

868
00:50:24.675 --> 00:50:28.525
or bold defiance, none are shackled slaves of faith.

869
00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:29.925
Nobody's telling you what to do.

870
00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:35.005
Yet the hand that guides is hidden, moving secret

871
00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:38.045
and unseen firmly guiding life's great drama.

872
00:50:38.615 --> 00:50:43.285
Every act and shifting seen even human wrath,

873
00:50:43.835 --> 00:50:48.805
unknowing serves that all controlling will man proposes

874
00:50:49.705 --> 00:50:52.805
God disposes all things his designed

875
00:50:53.035 --> 00:50:55.325
fulfill to that goal.

876
00:50:55.345 --> 00:50:58.325
Of all the ages, all of his history's windings tend,

877
00:50:58.355 --> 00:50:59.805
they all end up in the same place.

878
00:51:00.705 --> 00:51:02.085
And despite all foes

879
00:51:02.085 --> 00:51:06.005
or factions, God proves victor in the end, mysteries,

880
00:51:06.095 --> 00:51:09.685
which hurt and baffle past our power to understand,

881
00:51:09.905 --> 00:51:12.605
we just don't get it in the end.

882
00:51:12.705 --> 00:51:15.885
Our turn to blessing by that sovereign hidden hand

883
00:51:17.675 --> 00:51:20.085
that is the doctrine of providence, as best

884
00:51:20.085 --> 00:51:22.765
as I could put it in a poem that, that's amazing.

885
00:51:23.505 --> 00:51:25.485
Arthur Pearson. Well done.

886
00:51:26.595 --> 00:51:31.085
Alright, let's wrap up with the last section here,

887
00:51:31.625 --> 00:51:35.125
the government of Providence.

888
00:51:35.555 --> 00:51:37.565
What is meant by the government of Providence?

889
00:51:38.185 --> 00:51:40.445
Uh, here's what grew them says here,

890
00:51:40.665 --> 00:51:42.525
God has a purpose in all that he does.

891
00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:44.845
And he providentially, governs

892
00:51:45.025 --> 00:51:47.685
or directs all things to accomplish his purposes.

893
00:51:47.695 --> 00:51:50.685
We've kind of been saying that already with concurrence,

894
00:51:51.415 --> 00:51:54.955
but uh, back to Isaiah, my purpose

895
00:51:55.135 --> 00:51:56.795
and my pleasure, I will accomplish.

896
00:51:57.385 --> 00:51:58.835
He's, he's governing

897
00:51:58.835 --> 00:52:02.395
and directing everything to meet his goodwill.

898
00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:04.795
That's, that's the governance of providence.

899
00:52:05.385 --> 00:52:08.275
Alright, but doesn't providence encourage my laziness?

900
00:52:08.615 --> 00:52:12.995
If God's in control, why do I need to do anything? Right?

901
00:52:13.655 --> 00:52:16.035
So my students say, I didn't study last night

902
00:52:16.035 --> 00:52:19.035
because God's in control

903
00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.875
and he's gonna help me do well on my test.

904
00:52:21.825 --> 00:52:23.995
Good luck with that. I shouldn't say good luck.

905
00:52:23.995 --> 00:52:25.035
Good providence with that.

906
00:52:27.015 --> 00:52:29.435
Uh, Gruden gives the example of a farmer.

907
00:52:30.295 --> 00:52:32.995
The farmer says, God, give me a crop.

908
00:52:34.135 --> 00:52:38.675
But he doesn't do any work. It's not gonna happen. So, okay.

909
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:42.395
And by the way, laziness is frowned

910
00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:43.715
upon in scripture, right?

911
00:52:43.765 --> 00:52:45.235
We're we're supposed to be hard workers.

912
00:52:45.835 --> 00:52:47.875
Diligent laziness is a sin.

913
00:52:48.575 --> 00:52:51.275
He does not work, shall not heeds.

914
00:52:51.575 --> 00:52:55.075
So, okay, Providence does not

915
00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:56.755
encourage laziness.

916
00:52:57.255 --> 00:53:00.355
But what we can be assured of is when we work hard

917
00:53:00.375 --> 00:53:03.995
and do things under the Lord, we also can be rest assured

918
00:53:03.995 --> 00:53:08.035
that he's working to bless our efforts as we go.

919
00:53:09.015 --> 00:53:10.595
How does Providence intersect with prayer?

920
00:53:11.695 --> 00:53:13.635
And this is a good question as well.

921
00:53:14.495 --> 00:53:17.035
Uh, if God's in control and he knows all things

922
00:53:17.055 --> 00:53:18.995
and he's working all things, why do I need to pray?

923
00:53:20.625 --> 00:53:23.475
Okay? That's what the question is here.

924
00:53:24.415 --> 00:53:27.845
God is ordained prayer, uh, for says to be a means

925
00:53:27.865 --> 00:53:30.125
to bring about results in the world.

926
00:53:30.905 --> 00:53:33.885
He knows our needs Before we ask Matthew six,

927
00:53:33.915 --> 00:53:36.125
your father knows what you need before you ask him.

928
00:53:36.545 --> 00:53:38.845
If he knows what I need, why should I pray and ask him?

929
00:53:39.875 --> 00:53:42.035
Well, keep reading scripture.

930
00:53:42.215 --> 00:53:44.915
We have not because we asked for him.

931
00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:47.235
He knows what you need, but you didn't ask for it.

932
00:53:49.135 --> 00:53:52.075
Oh, until now you've asked for nothing and ask

933
00:53:52.075 --> 00:53:53.155
and you shall receive.

934
00:53:54.135 --> 00:53:58.315
Oh, okay. So that's why we pray it's much more than that.

935
00:53:59.455 --> 00:54:00.875
But, uh, we'll get to that in just a minute.

936
00:54:00.945 --> 00:54:02.715
Paul says, pray without ceasing.

937
00:54:02.715 --> 00:54:05.315
Okay, but wait, God's in control. He knows everything.

938
00:54:05.345 --> 00:54:07.235
He's working everything. Why do I need to pray?

939
00:54:08.535 --> 00:54:10.395
And Paul says, pray without ceasing.

940
00:54:11.455 --> 00:54:14.755
Uh, there's a, what's interesting here is

941
00:54:15.615 --> 00:54:16.675
why, why do we need to pray?

942
00:54:17.215 --> 00:54:18.955
One of the one

943
00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:22.955
of the misconceptions about prayer is we think that we're

944
00:54:23.505 --> 00:54:25.435
talking God into doing something.

945
00:54:27.255 --> 00:54:29.475
God, you know, would you do this for me?

946
00:54:30.055 --> 00:54:34.195
Uh, prayer is not for him. This is our sprawl here.

947
00:54:34.195 --> 00:54:37.315
Prayer's not for his good, but for for yours.

948
00:54:38.015 --> 00:54:41.675
Prayer reminds us, uh, excuse John.

949
00:54:42.655 --> 00:54:45.655
Uh, prayer's not so much for him.

950
00:54:45.795 --> 00:54:47.375
He, he already knows what he's gonna do.

951
00:54:47.995 --> 00:54:50.495
But it's to remind us where our source is,

952
00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:52.015
where our health comes from.

953
00:54:52.955 --> 00:54:55.855
We are to pray to constantly keep our eyes on him.

954
00:54:56.045 --> 00:54:57.215
It's not, it's

955
00:54:57.215 --> 00:55:00.495
because he goes, oh, I didn't know you needed

956
00:55:00.525 --> 00:55:02.655
that until you pray.

957
00:55:03.075 --> 00:55:06.215
He also loves and he loves it. He loves for us to talk.

958
00:55:06.245 --> 00:55:09.735
It's a conversation with him. Absolutely. So, okay.

959
00:55:09.735 --> 00:55:11.935
That's how providence and prayer work together.

960
00:55:13.355 --> 00:55:15.255
Let me wrap up and then I'm gonna hand this over

961
00:55:15.255 --> 00:55:16.815
to Brad here in just a second.

962
00:55:17.645 --> 00:55:20.655
What are some ways we can apply this?

963
00:55:21.075 --> 00:55:23.615
Uh, I put some things in there. This is not from groom.

964
00:55:24.665 --> 00:55:25.855
These are things that, uh,

965
00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:27.935
I've read in other books on Providence.

966
00:55:29.075 --> 00:55:31.855
But let's apply this to our lives. Providence is personal.

967
00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:36.575
Uh, if God has a big grand story

968
00:55:37.115 --> 00:55:40.615
for everything, then you're a part of that story.

969
00:55:41.555 --> 00:55:44.975
He has a purpose for you and for me.

970
00:55:45.195 --> 00:55:47.215
And he's working all these things out in your

971
00:55:47.215 --> 00:55:48.535
life as part of that story.

972
00:55:48.605 --> 00:55:52.415
Even the smallest details. Uh, it's personal.

973
00:55:52.735 --> 00:55:53.975
I told you at the very beginning.

974
00:55:53.975 --> 00:55:57.895
Providence is profound and personal at the same time.

975
00:55:58.385 --> 00:56:01.015
Providence is punchable. We don't like this.

976
00:56:01.195 --> 00:56:03.215
We want God to work on our timetable,

977
00:56:03.875 --> 00:56:05.095
but he's always on time.

978
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.415
If you think about it from his

979
00:56:07.415 --> 00:56:08.975
perspective, he's always on time.

980
00:56:10.125 --> 00:56:13.495
He's not on our time, but he's always on time.

981
00:56:13.645 --> 00:56:17.375
He's punctual. You can always count on him to do,

982
00:56:18.435 --> 00:56:21.175
uh, what he says he's gonna do on time.

983
00:56:22.945 --> 00:56:24.605
Uh, providence is probably my favorite,

984
00:56:24.685 --> 00:56:26.205
produces a peace of mind.

985
00:56:26.965 --> 00:56:29.605
I don't have to fear or fret or worry

986
00:56:30.465 --> 00:56:34.125
or dread circumstances

987
00:56:34.875 --> 00:56:37.005
because I know he's in control

988
00:56:37.265 --> 00:56:40.365
and he's working all things for my good, good.

989
00:56:40.625 --> 00:56:43.965
You all know this. So when I think about those things,

990
00:56:44.065 --> 00:56:46.085
it gives me a piece of mind.

991
00:56:46.545 --> 00:56:49.205
Others may fear all kinds of things.

992
00:56:49.465 --> 00:56:53.285
You and I don't have to because of providence.

993
00:56:53.865 --> 00:56:55.285
It also encourages our faith.

994
00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:59.765
I know God's gonna come through 'cause I know he's working.

995
00:56:59.955 --> 00:57:02.485
He's sovereign. He will do it. He said he would.

996
00:57:03.625 --> 00:57:08.485
It also breeds humility. I'm not in control. What?

997
00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:10.525
I'm not in control and neither are you.

998
00:57:11.725 --> 00:57:14.445
Somebody else is in control that that humbles me.

999
00:57:16.225 --> 00:57:20.405
So the Bible says, we don't say I'm gonna do this and such.

1000
00:57:21.225 --> 00:57:22.325
We say, what do we say?

1001
00:57:23.385 --> 00:57:25.765
If the Lord wills, I'll do this and such, right?

1002
00:57:26.345 --> 00:57:27.405
I'm not in control of God.

1003
00:57:27.425 --> 00:57:29.365
If you would let me today, I would love to,

1004
00:57:30.145 --> 00:57:31.405
to do X, Y, and Z.

1005
00:57:31.625 --> 00:57:33.045
It breeds humility in us

1006
00:57:33.945 --> 00:57:37.045
and it encourages patience and suffering.

1007
00:57:37.045 --> 00:57:39.405
You're going through something hard, difficult,

1008
00:57:39.795 --> 00:57:42.125
painful, and we all have been there.

1009
00:57:43.785 --> 00:57:46.725
We can be patient because we know God is working these

1010
00:57:46.725 --> 00:57:47.925
things out for our good.

1011
00:57:49.025 --> 00:57:52.685
And so I don't have to, you know, I don't have to, uh,

1012
00:57:52.705 --> 00:57:54.165
to get angry at God.

1013
00:57:55.365 --> 00:57:58.025
I don't have to demand

1014
00:57:58.025 --> 00:57:59.665
that he tell me why things are happening.

1015
00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:03.185
I can just be patient because I know he's

1016
00:58:03.185 --> 00:58:04.305
working all these things out.

1017
00:58:04.595 --> 00:58:07.665
Providence is very application, uh,

1018
00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:09.625
applicable to our lives.

1019
00:58:10.335 --> 00:58:13.025
I'll finish with, this is my summary of the doctrine.

1020
00:58:13.765 --> 00:58:17.225
God cooperates with his creation to accomplish his will

1021
00:58:18.205 --> 00:58:19.665
and good purposes.

1022
00:58:20.165 --> 00:58:22.945
Can we fully understand this doctrine? Absolutely not.

1023
00:58:23.015 --> 00:58:25.305
It's profound. It's beyond our minds.

1024
00:58:25.965 --> 00:58:28.465
But can we trust that it's true? Absolutely.

1025
00:58:28.465 --> 00:58:30.905
It's in his word. We know it's true.

1026
00:58:32.145 --> 00:58:34.425
Proverbs tells us, trust the Lord with all your heart

1027
00:58:35.485 --> 00:58:38.905
and lean not on your own understanding.

1028
00:58:40.925 --> 00:58:44.305
My last, uh, slide here and I'll hand this over to Brad.

1029
00:58:45.685 --> 00:58:48.425
Uh, my challenge to you tonight when you go to bed tonight

1030
00:58:49.765 --> 00:58:54.505
is to reflect on God's progress in your life.

1031
00:58:54.575 --> 00:58:57.025
Even today, God's been at work.

1032
00:58:58.805 --> 00:59:01.345
What's he been up to today? You've been so busy.

1033
00:59:01.575 --> 00:59:03.385
I've been so busy running and doing

1034
00:59:03.485 --> 00:59:05.385
and living on no margin at all.

1035
00:59:06.645 --> 00:59:11.545
But when you lay down at night, reflect on your day.

1036
00:59:11.935 --> 00:59:13.705
What has God been up to today?

1037
00:59:13.705 --> 00:59:16.705
What are the little evidences of Providence?

1038
00:59:17.205 --> 00:59:18.505
One of my favorite books on

1039
00:59:18.505 --> 00:59:19.865
Providence, the mystery of Providence.

1040
00:59:19.865 --> 00:59:21.845
John Flail, uh, he

1041
00:59:21.845 --> 00:59:24.005
who believes in providence will have providences

1042
00:59:24.025 --> 00:59:25.605
to note you.

1043
00:59:25.745 --> 00:59:27.685
If you're mindful of providence,

1044
00:59:27.685 --> 00:59:29.285
you'll always see it everywhere.

1045
00:59:29.435 --> 00:59:32.085
That was providential. That was providential.

1046
00:59:32.265 --> 00:59:35.045
We say that was a God thing, but guess what?

1047
00:59:35.045 --> 00:59:40.005
Everything's a God thing. But do you have evidences

1048
00:59:40.005 --> 00:59:42.325
in your life today when you lay down at night?

1049
00:59:44.985 --> 00:59:47.005
God, show me what you did today.

1050
00:59:48.085 --> 00:59:52.365
I wasn't even paying attention. Show me what you did today.

1051
00:59:53.615 --> 00:59:55.725
Years ago, uh, we were poor.

1052
00:59:56.965 --> 01:00:00.445
I was working at CHA, Annie was home with four kids.

1053
01:00:00.585 --> 01:00:01.845
Our air conditioner went out

1054
01:00:02.905 --> 01:00:05.285
and we were told $3,000 to fix it.

1055
01:00:06.225 --> 01:00:07.365
We didn't have that kind of money.

1056
01:00:08.265 --> 01:00:09.805
And so we were like, what are we gonna do?

1057
01:00:10.465 --> 01:00:14.925
We didn't tell anybody. This not one person, two people,

1058
01:00:15.665 --> 01:00:20.525
one a friend and another family member sensed that

1059
01:00:21.395 --> 01:00:22.885
they needed to bless us somehow.

1060
01:00:23.865 --> 01:00:24.885
We didn't tell 'em a thing.

1061
01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.205
They both sent us a check for $1,500.

1062
01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:33.445
That was lucky.

1063
01:00:37.785 --> 01:00:39.045
So here's my second challenge.

1064
01:00:39.895 --> 01:00:42.045
Providence has happened all the time around you.

1065
01:00:42.515 --> 01:00:44.245
He's always at work. Where is he?

1066
01:00:45.365 --> 01:00:48.065
You have Providence as to know you do have some today.

1067
01:00:48.085 --> 01:00:49.225
You might have some this week,

1068
01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:50.265
you might have some this year.

1069
01:00:51.725 --> 01:00:54.945
Do you celebrate God's providence in your life?

1070
01:00:55.045 --> 01:00:57.425
Do you market somehow?

1071
01:00:58.885 --> 01:01:02.425
We put a big sign next to our thermostat. God is cool.

1072
01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:07.065
So every time I walked down the hall, God is cool.

1073
01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:12.505
I remember that story. God's at work.

1074
01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:14.505
What will you do when you lay your head down tonight?

1075
01:01:16.565 --> 01:01:21.145
And are you marking the providences in your life?

1076
01:01:21.935 --> 01:01:23.985
It's an amazing, amazing doctrine.

1077
01:01:24.455 --> 01:01:27.345
It's not just to know more about God, it's to experience him

1078
01:01:29.055 --> 01:01:30.185
fall more in love with him.

1079
01:01:31.045 --> 01:01:32.665
So thank you Brad.

1080
01:01:32.805 --> 01:01:36.265
Uh, Sylvester is gonna come and lead us in some discussion.

1081
01:01:36.835 --> 01:01:37.185
Thank

1082
01:01:49.645 --> 01:01:50.645
You. You glad?

1083
01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:51.345
Yes.

1084
01:01:51.655 --> 01:01:55.345
That we have elders like Aaron

1085
01:01:55.525 --> 01:01:58.425
and some of these guys sitting in the background

1086
01:01:59.485 --> 01:02:02.505
who can not only lead and care

1087
01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:08.545
and protect, teach Thank

1088
01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:10.145
you masterclass.

1089
01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:12.505
And we've had them every year.

1090
01:02:13.965 --> 01:02:15.865
So back to levels.

1091
01:02:17.655 --> 01:02:19.365
Providences to note.

1092
01:02:22.335 --> 01:02:26.805
Would anybody like to share their own providence

1093
01:02:27.305 --> 01:02:29.325
to note a time

1094
01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:32.565
or an experience of

1095
01:02:32.735 --> 01:02:37.085
where you saw God's providence happen in your life?

1096
01:02:40.335 --> 01:02:41.335
Floor is open.

1097
01:02:42.185 --> 01:02:46.125
How much time do we have? Not much.

1098
01:02:54.075 --> 01:02:56.045
Brad, do you want a long story or a short story?

1099
01:02:56.475 --> 01:02:57.885
I've got nine minutes. Okay.

1100
01:02:59.265 --> 01:03:04.045
Um, so this is a, an evidence

1101
01:03:04.045 --> 01:03:06.485
of God's providence in my life, in the life

1102
01:03:06.505 --> 01:03:07.885
of his providence.

1103
01:03:07.945 --> 01:03:11.245
But, um, 15 years ago,

1104
01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:15.085
I found myself at a year of training in St.

1105
01:03:15.085 --> 01:03:18.445
Louis. That was my last choice of places to go

1106
01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:19.765
to study what I do.

1107
01:03:20.225 --> 01:03:21.285
And I didn't want to be there.

1108
01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:23.765
And I'll say that I enjoyed

1109
01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:24.845
it while I was there, but I didn't wanna go.

1110
01:03:25.195 --> 01:03:26.445
Halfway through the year

1111
01:03:27.305 --> 01:03:29.325
was when the giant earthquake happened in Haiti.

1112
01:03:29.945 --> 01:03:33.325
And uh, and I felt this just urging in my heart,

1113
01:03:34.095 --> 01:03:36.045
God's urging my heart to go and serve there.

1114
01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.245
So I followed that.

1115
01:03:37.635 --> 01:03:40.005
There's the long version is how he opened all those doors.

1116
01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:41.165
But I found myself there

1117
01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:42.845
and there was a young boy

1118
01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:45.765
who was about 12 years old at the time,

1119
01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.525
who had his leg crushed.

1120
01:03:49.065 --> 01:03:52.005
And the word I received was a

1121
01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.285
don't need to take this kid's leg.

1122
01:03:54.285 --> 01:03:56.165
We're gonna try and save it. Okay?

1123
01:03:56.785 --> 01:03:58.925
So we took care of him, had a bunch of other kids

1124
01:03:59.145 --> 01:04:00.485
and a lot of stories.

1125
01:04:02.025 --> 01:04:05.845
And, um, two weeks went by. I went back to St.

1126
01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:09.045
Louis the day after I got back, went to work the next day.

1127
01:04:09.865 --> 01:04:11.325
And uh, they said, Hey,

1128
01:04:11.445 --> 01:04:13.405
TR there's a kid coming from the hospital.

1129
01:04:13.425 --> 01:04:16.605
You were in Haiti to have his leg reconstructed here.

1130
01:04:17.445 --> 01:04:18.645
I said, oh, that's a lot.

1131
01:04:19.865 --> 01:04:23.565
And so the Lord had constructed for him to come to to St.

1132
01:04:23.565 --> 01:04:24.965
Louis to have that procedure done.

1133
01:04:25.505 --> 01:04:28.525
And so he stayed there and had that was successful.

1134
01:04:29.545 --> 01:04:33.845
Um, and in the process, learning English was cared for

1135
01:04:33.985 --> 01:04:36.845
by a family who took care of him, cared for his needs,

1136
01:04:36.855 --> 01:04:39.445
physically, spiritually, all the things.

1137
01:04:40.385 --> 01:04:43.005
Um, fast forward 15 years,

1138
01:04:44.275 --> 01:04:47.405
that same young man is now a fourth year medical student

1139
01:04:48.265 --> 01:04:50.845
who is here in Oklahoma City today rotating

1140
01:04:50.985 --> 01:04:52.605
as a medical student

1141
01:04:52.745 --> 01:04:56.125
for orthopedic surgery resident at ou.

1142
01:04:56.185 --> 01:04:59.565
So I mean, that's looking back on the Walgreens,

1143
01:04:59.565 --> 01:05:00.805
there's a hundred evidences

1144
01:05:00.805 --> 01:05:02.365
of God's providence all through that.

1145
01:05:08.555 --> 01:05:12.325
Anybody else? You can't make that up. You can't.

1146
01:05:17.265 --> 01:05:20.245
Yes. I used to be a surveyor back in the day.

1147
01:05:20.425 --> 01:05:21.965
Worked international mostly.

1148
01:05:23.025 --> 01:05:27.805
Uh, I was about 2122 on my first hit in Africa.

1149
01:05:28.385 --> 01:05:30.205
Uh, just hit court.

1150
01:05:30.585 --> 01:05:35.485
I'd been working offshore and uh, it was probably midnight

1151
01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:39.205
and, uh, I was heading out to go get a cab people

1152
01:05:39.585 --> 01:05:42.485
to the hotel that we had in there in town.

1153
01:05:43.225 --> 01:05:44.565
And I'm walking over to a cab

1154
01:05:45.185 --> 01:05:48.165
and one of the fellas in the building

1155
01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:52.245
and the locals saw me, came running out and grabbed me

1156
01:05:53.225 --> 01:05:57.965
and he said, not go in that ca go into that cab.

1157
01:05:59.585 --> 01:06:03.005
And I just, I, I was tired.

1158
01:06:03.105 --> 01:06:07.925
And I just remember the one he he sent me to

1159
01:06:07.925 --> 01:06:10.765
and he went over, he talked to the, the caddy, uh,

1160
01:06:10.955 --> 01:06:13.645
when I got in and the guy took me back to the hotel.

1161
01:06:14.755 --> 01:06:19.695
Uh, and it turned out that there were a lot of folks

1162
01:06:20.045 --> 01:06:23.415
that were closing these caddies and taking people to alleys

1163
01:06:23.435 --> 01:06:26.015
and beating the heck out 'em and taking the money

1164
01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:28.495
and killing some people in the process of a few cases.

1165
01:06:29.275 --> 01:06:33.055
Uh, found out the next morning guy from the same crew had

1166
01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.735
gotten off and was in the hospital, uh,

1167
01:06:35.735 --> 01:06:37.655
after that happened to him that night.

1168
01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:41.495
Uh, so I count that as a,

1169
01:06:51.095 --> 01:06:52.255
I agree with Aaron.

1170
01:06:52.915 --> 01:06:55.215
Um, I believe the doctrine

1171
01:06:55.835 --> 01:07:00.495
of Providence has changed my life except for the Bible.

1172
01:07:04.155 --> 01:07:05.855
The greatest book that I've ever read is

1173
01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.215
Providence by John Viper.

1174
01:07:09.695 --> 01:07:12.055
I would highly recommend you reading.

1175
01:07:13.755 --> 01:07:18.215
It will change your life. It's big. It's 711 pages.

1176
01:07:20.135 --> 01:07:24.295
I read it twice 'cause it takes a little bit to absorb.

1177
01:07:26.155 --> 01:07:29.815
But if you look at life through the lens

1178
01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:31.775
of God's purposeful,

1179
01:07:32.185 --> 01:07:36.415
purposeful sovereignty over everything, oh,

1180
01:07:37.155 --> 01:07:40.615
the peace and the joy and the comfort

1181
01:07:41.355 --> 01:07:42.495
and the lack of fear

1182
01:07:43.275 --> 01:07:44.935
and the perfect trust

1183
01:07:47.725 --> 01:07:48.815
that will change your life.

1184
01:07:49.855 --> 01:07:51.935
I dare you. I dare you read. I dare you.

1185
01:07:53.575 --> 01:07:56.215
I have a bunch of true false questions.

1186
01:08:00.905 --> 01:08:05.725
Is God purposefully sovereign

1187
01:08:07.235 --> 01:08:08.325
over President Trump?

1188
01:08:09.475 --> 01:08:10.925
True or false? True.

1189
01:08:14.425 --> 01:08:17.765
Is he accomplishing all of his good pleasure

1190
01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:21.125
over President Putin?

1191
01:08:23.595 --> 01:08:26.125
True. The Taliban

1192
01:08:27.795 --> 01:08:28.795
True.

1193
01:08:30.295 --> 01:08:32.045
Hamas True.

1194
01:08:34.715 --> 01:08:35.325
Your boss,

1195
01:08:41.825 --> 01:08:46.125
if you believe in the doctrine, the problem he gives

1196
01:08:47.385 --> 01:08:50.645
all the good, all the bad, all the warts.

1197
01:08:51.415 --> 01:08:55.565
There is a primary causation and it is God.

1198
01:08:57.145 --> 01:09:00.965
Are we morally, responsibly responsible agents? We are.

1199
01:09:01.775 --> 01:09:05.645
We're on the hook. God is causing all those things.

1200
01:09:11.115 --> 01:09:11.725
Next question.

1201
01:09:16.275 --> 01:09:18.845
Does anybody know Romans 8 28

1202
01:09:21.305 --> 01:09:24.365
causes all things to work out.

1203
01:09:30.715 --> 01:09:33.565
What then is the for my good

1204
01:09:34.985 --> 01:09:38.645
in Romans A 28, if all

1205
01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:40.045
that happens to me is

1206
01:09:40.225 --> 01:09:45.045
Bad, Like

1207
01:09:45.045 --> 01:09:49.445
for instance are our baby dies,

1208
01:09:51.865 --> 01:09:53.725
my wife gets stricken by cancer,

1209
01:09:55.785 --> 01:09:58.645
my mom passes away, I lose my job.

1210
01:10:02.245 --> 01:10:07.085
Hmm. How was

1211
01:10:07.085 --> 01:10:08.165
that for my good?

1212
01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:11.275
Yes sir.

1213
01:10:11.935 --> 01:10:14.735
I may be wrong, but I think the passage says all things

1214
01:10:14.805 --> 01:10:18.335
work together for good.

1215
01:10:19.165 --> 01:10:21.535
That doesn't mean that individual good,

1216
01:10:23.245 --> 01:10:26.775
crucified on the cross didn't make for very pleasant,

1217
01:10:29.635 --> 01:10:32.855
but it worked together for good.

1218
01:10:33.725 --> 01:10:37.575
Because now that person crucified is sitting

1219
01:10:37.675 --> 01:10:40.535
and throwing the universe for our,

1220
01:10:50.395 --> 01:10:54.895
You can say the same for Paul, but thorn hurt,

1221
01:10:57.715 --> 01:10:59.135
but thorn didn't feel good.

1222
01:11:00.235 --> 01:11:02.055
But who gave Paul thorn?

1223
01:11:08.235 --> 01:11:12.295
If you look at the next verse actually goes back to

1224
01:11:12.955 --> 01:11:14.325
what our elder has said.

1225
01:11:16.825 --> 01:11:19.005
In my opinion, the answer is in the next verse,

1226
01:11:20.665 --> 01:11:23.045
to be conformed to the image of his son.

1227
01:11:26.785 --> 01:11:31.645
As bad as it, as bad as the cru fiction was

1228
01:11:33.545 --> 01:11:35.045
as bad as filling the blank.

1229
01:11:40.035 --> 01:11:44.605
Last question. Why even study this

1230
01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:52.045
Experiences a lot of the deeper sense Because

1231
01:11:52.945 --> 01:11:54.325
all things work together for good.

1232
01:11:54.705 --> 01:11:58.125
But at the end of that is that for his purposes

1233
01:11:58.705 --> 01:12:01.765
and if he internally loves us, we're part of his purpose,

1234
01:12:04.285 --> 01:12:06.085
I will accomplish all my purpose.

1235
01:12:06.505 --> 01:12:09.645
And in the Hebrew that means all my good pleasure.

1236
01:12:11.545 --> 01:12:13.885
So if you believe God

1237
01:12:13.945 --> 01:12:15.125
and you trust God,

1238
01:12:16.635 --> 01:12:19.085
then we can feel confident in that.

1239
01:12:19.155 --> 01:12:21.045
Like he's looking out for me.

1240
01:12:22.945 --> 01:12:25.325
It might have to be for my eternal good.

1241
01:12:26.765 --> 01:12:28.325
'cause you can't say to the martyrs,

1242
01:12:30.355 --> 01:12:31.885
well no man, it's for your good.

1243
01:12:32.985 --> 01:12:35.125
You can't that it's not good.

1244
01:12:36.015 --> 01:12:37.805
Think of all the things that aren't good

1245
01:12:38.435 --> 01:12:41.085
burning at the stake that doesn't, that is not good,

1246
01:12:42.945 --> 01:12:47.285
but it's for their eternal good or somebody else's or mine.

1247
01:12:48.725 --> 01:12:52.765
I mean, who knows? And so

1248
01:12:54.145 --> 01:12:57.845
it is that strengthening of faith and love and joy

1249
01:12:57.865 --> 01:13:00.285
and trust and rest.

1250
01:13:01.235 --> 01:13:05.765
Contentness you become fearless.

1251
01:13:06.995 --> 01:13:09.485
It's not cavalier.

1252
01:13:11.275 --> 01:13:15.965
It's like Aaron said it. It is. You've got to be kidding.

1253
01:13:17.665 --> 01:13:20.245
The dependence that I have on you, it's stunning.

1254
01:13:25.555 --> 01:13:25.775
So

1255
01:13:30.055 --> 01:13:31.095
I have one question.

1256
01:13:34.695 --> 01:13:36.535
I thank you

1257
01:13:47.525 --> 01:13:49.935
Mark, uh, has a song for us to close.

1258
01:13:51.275 --> 01:13:52.535
See if I can get this work.

1259
01:13:54.075 --> 01:13:56.135
Uh, while we stand, we'll, we'll sing this together.

1260
01:14:23.035 --> 01:14:24.525
This is my

1261
01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:53.845
he,

1262
01:16:31.075 --> 01:16:31.885
This is,

1263
01:17:22.525 --> 01:17:23.525
Let's pray Again.

1264
01:17:23.825 --> 01:17:26.675
Lord, thank you for this reminder tonight

1265
01:17:26.865 --> 01:17:29.195
that this is your world, not ours.

1266
01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.675
You're in control, not us.

1267
01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:34.195
Pray as we leave

1268
01:17:34.855 --> 01:17:36.635
and as we lay our head down tonight,

1269
01:17:36.765 --> 01:17:38.635
we'll remember these things.

1270
01:17:39.425 --> 01:17:42.235
What you did today, what you did this week, what you've done

1271
01:17:42.295 --> 01:17:44.555
for us our entire lives.

1272
01:17:45.855 --> 01:17:49.115
You've been working and doing,

1273
01:17:50.145 --> 01:17:51.435
they're paying attention.

1274
01:17:53.455 --> 01:17:55.315
So great. Tonight we'll reflect on that.

1275
01:17:55.565 --> 01:18:00.555
We'll mark the ways that we see providence in our lives

1276
01:18:01.655 --> 01:18:04.595
and let us live in the knowledge that you're in.

1277
01:18:04.595 --> 01:18:06.635
Control your work at all.

1278
01:18:11.165 --> 01:18:12.955
Thank you all for being here today. Thank.
