WEBVTT

1
00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:38.255
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:40.895
Uh, I can't tell you how much I was looking forward

3
00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:42.655
to being together today.

4
00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:46.895
Uh, we always need to be held up by brothers

5
00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.095
and sisters in the church,

6
00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:50.135
but some days you just feel it more than others.

7
00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:52.895
And so today is one of those days,

8
00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.415
and, uh, many of you have been aware that over the last

9
00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.655
few years, uh, my family, extended family has been going

10
00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:01.335
through, uh, a long season

11
00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.495
of trial involving my older sister.

12
00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:06.415
And so some of you don't know,

13
00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:07.855
some bring you up to speed a little bit.

14
00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:09.775
Uh, this is a picture of her

15
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.135
with my hero grandpa at her high school graduation.

16
00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:17.895
And, um, 15 years ago

17
00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.775
after having her second child, my sister had a stroke

18
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:23.335
that no one could explain.

19
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:27.775
And so it affected her movement a little bit on one side,

20
00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:29.535
but mostly her personality changed.

21
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.855
And, and so it wasn't terribly bad.

22
00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:36.215
But then six years ago, it was a,

23
00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:39.175
another stroke, much bigger this time,

24
00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:42.975
and one that changed the course of life for her

25
00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:46.335
and for her family and for our extended family.

26
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:48.775
Uh, it was actually on a Sunday morning

27
00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:53.135
and, uh, six years ago, I, I preached and then we left

28
00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.335
and went to the hospital in Tulsa to see her.

29
00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:58.255
And so she spent months in the hospital,

30
00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:00.095
extended specialty care.

31
00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:02.775
For a long time, she never really gained her ability

32
00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:03.855
to speak back

33
00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:07.975
and, uh, demanded 24 7 care more or less.

34
00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:12.575
And, and then just, yeah, uh, in

35
00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:14.935
and outta the hospital repeatedly over the last six years.

36
00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:18.535
And so a couple times we thought this was the end,

37
00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.295
and then she'd come back strong.

38
00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:23.625
And, and just a few months ago though, uh,

39
00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.785
it finally became clear that her body was shutting down.

40
00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:30.065
And, uh, till just a couple days ago, Friday evening,

41
00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:33.905
she died peacefully bringing to an end that, uh,

42
00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:35.665
long journey of suffering.

43
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:40.425
And so, uh, many of you have prayed for her

44
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:43.145
and for our family over the last six years.

45
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:46.025
And just wanted to say, I can't tell you

46
00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:47.105
how much that's meant to us.

47
00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:49.905
Um, really say thank you

48
00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:52.425
for you who've journeyed that with us.

49
00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:54.905
It's been a, a long journey,

50
00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:57.265
but incredibly encouraging

51
00:02:57.285 --> 00:02:59.340
to watch the body be the, the body.

52
00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:02.565
Uh, it, it's hard, a very public position of course.

53
00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.685
And so it's hard to, to suffer privately, uh,

54
00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.285
when you can't hide some things.

55
00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:11.045
And so to watch church become

56
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.125
deeper church together has been neat.

57
00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:18.725
So thank you for that. But it has required a lot from her

58
00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:21.965
husband, from my mom, from her kids, uh, a lot

59
00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:24.845
of other people like just to watch so many people

60
00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:30.125
really dive in and care for her and, uh, support us

61
00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:31.405
and them along the way.

62
00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:33.125
It's been neat to watch that,

63
00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:35.765
but especially I wanted

64
00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:38.485
to highlight two people in this journey

65
00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.445
that I've been really thankful for.

66
00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:44.845
My, my brother-in-law, uh, her husband, you know, if you've,

67
00:03:44.865 --> 00:03:47.685
if you know anything about strokes and,

68
00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:52.085
and, um, traumatic brain injuries, often the spouse,

69
00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:56.365
not often, sometimes the spouse doesn't stick around.

70
00:03:57.385 --> 00:03:59.485
Uh, it's hard. It's really hard.

71
00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:03.925
And so my brother-in-law has stayed steady

72
00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:06.325
and I'm thankful for that to care for my sister.

73
00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.245
Well, and then my mom, uh, she,

74
00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.445
I've talked about my mom a lot

75
00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:13.125
because she's an incredible warrior for the Lord

76
00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:15.405
and for me and our family.

77
00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:21.085
And she has walked this journey with such joy, uh,

78
00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:24.725
not through no tears and, and pain and sorrow,

79
00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:27.845
but she has walked this road with, with a measure

80
00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:29.925
of hope and joy.

81
00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:31.725
And, um, so this week,

82
00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:34.085
if you'd keep us in your prayers, Thursday's, the funeral.

83
00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:39.755
So I say all that because it's really funny how God works.

84
00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:46.105
If you were here six years ago on

85
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.145
that morning, our stroke happened.

86
00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:49.905
We, I preached and we left,

87
00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:53.385
but we just happened to be that summer.

88
00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:56.145
It was nearly six years ago, like two weeks ago.

89
00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:59.105
That summer was when we started this decades long

90
00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:00.185
journey through the Psalms.

91
00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:02.105
If you remember, we started it way back then.

92
00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:05.745
Uh, Psalm two was that morning.

93
00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:09.305
But then that week we didn't know was she

94
00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:10.505
gonna make it all this process.

95
00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:13.465
The next Sunday was Psalm three,

96
00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:15.825
just going through an order, right?

97
00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:19.425
Psalm three is the first Psalm of lament.

98
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:22.385
And God just set it up for us.

99
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:24.385
Like here, we're gonna lament together.

100
00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:27.785
I was grieving, we were grieving, you were grieving with us.

101
00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:29.305
And so God just set that up.

102
00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:31.505
And, and, and I shouldn't be surprised

103
00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:37.495
because today, like

104
00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:41.775
we're walking through Romans 12 months ago, we set up

105
00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:43.695
what we're gonna preach in order and these kind of things.

106
00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:50.015
Last week was all about rejoicing in hope.

107
00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:54.385
Something more eternity, future we can have joy today.

108
00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:58.485
Well, today we're talking about patience

109
00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:00.485
in the middle of tribulation.

110
00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:03.685
I don't think this is an accident.

111
00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:09.005
The Lord In his funny sovereignty worked all this out

112
00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:13.685
for us today to talk about how we can endure

113
00:06:14.405 --> 00:06:17.645
difficulties, how we can wait well

114
00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:20.565
through the trials of life.

115
00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:25.655
I shouldn't be surprised, but here we are.

116
00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:29.215
And here's why this is important, not just for me,

117
00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:32.135
like again, this is, this is just raw, right?

118
00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:36.015
Uh, it's important for me to hear these things

119
00:06:36.035 --> 00:06:37.055
and to believe these things

120
00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:38.415
and to be remind these things of course.

121
00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:41.135
But it's important I think for all of us

122
00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:42.335
because I've heard it said this way.

123
00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:48.455
You're either coming out of a trial in the middle

124
00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:52.175
of a trial or about to go a trial

125
00:06:54.885 --> 00:06:58.795
like every one of us has been

126
00:06:58.975 --> 00:07:00.195
is or will suffer.

127
00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:07.455
Difficulties will come. It might not be as heavy as

128
00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:08.935
as a, a family loss or,

129
00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:11.175
or persecution directly or world war.

130
00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:12.975
It might not be any of that stuff.

131
00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:15.535
But all of us, none of us are immune

132
00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:18.295
to difficulties coming our way.

133
00:07:21.105 --> 00:07:24.465
I mean, Jesus said it himself, John 1633.

134
00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:27.185
He said, in the world you will have tribulation.

135
00:07:28.525 --> 00:07:32.265
Not you might you will. Trouble will come.

136
00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:35.145
Difficulties will come for every one of us.

137
00:07:39.465 --> 00:07:41.485
And if that's true, then we better

138
00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:42.685
know how we're gonna handle it.

139
00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:48.405
We better know what we're gonna do to, to be able to endure

140
00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:51.045
underneath the trial that's coming.

141
00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:54.205
And we can do that with joy and with hope

142
00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:56.645
and with with faithfulness when it happens,

143
00:07:56.705 --> 00:07:57.845
we better know how to handle that.

144
00:07:58.025 --> 00:08:00.165
We have to pre decide how we can handle that.

145
00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:04.575
Build up the faith we need, almost like vitamins today so

146
00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:08.255
that when the things come later we can handle it.

147
00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.495
How we can be patient in the middle. That's the question.

148
00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:14.335
'cause here's the other option. Like we can,

149
00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:15.375
we can pursue that.

150
00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:17.135
Or the other option is

151
00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:19.455
that we could crumble when the hard things come.

152
00:08:21.345 --> 00:08:23.955
We could bail on faith.

153
00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:25.875
We could bail on all of this

154
00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:28.275
because our life isn't comfortable like we

155
00:08:28.365 --> 00:08:29.515
hoped God would make it.

156
00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:33.605
That that's really, I mean those are extremes.

157
00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:35.405
Those are two options we have really.

158
00:08:35.425 --> 00:08:36.805
And so today we're gonna see this,

159
00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:38.125
this side patient endurance.

160
00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:41.205
That's what we want. And how

161
00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:44.965
that patient endurance reveals true faith actually reveals

162
00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:46.685
it to us and to the world.

163
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:50.165
But also it is actually how God sanctifies us.

164
00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:54.605
How he reveals his glory to the world is by changing us

165
00:08:55.145 --> 00:08:58.655
in the middle of the journey through trials.

166
00:08:59.075 --> 00:09:00.375
That's why this is so important.

167
00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:05.655
And we'll especially see that as we look at Romans 12,

168
00:09:05.705 --> 00:09:08.495
verse 12, just the second phrase of that verse.

169
00:09:08.505 --> 00:09:10.135
We're gonna keep going phrase by phrase

170
00:09:10.135 --> 00:09:11.535
through this chapter.

171
00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:14.975
But what we're gonna see, the phrase is be

172
00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:16.215
patient in tribulation.

173
00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:17.655
We're gonna look at what

174
00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:20.495
that word be patient meant originally.

175
00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:24.255
It's gonna teach us a lot about this idea of endurance

176
00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.335
Because, 'cause we hear patience

177
00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:29.895
and we might think like just, you know,

178
00:09:29.895 --> 00:09:32.415
sitting at a red light, being able to not get angry.

179
00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:36.895
Like that's yes, but we're talking about something more than

180
00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:40.375
that because that word be patient originally meant

181
00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:43.655
to remain under like an umbrella.

182
00:09:43.675 --> 00:09:46.135
If you want to remain dry, you remain under the umbrella,

183
00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:49.455
but, but actually it's also to remain under a trial,

184
00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:52.655
remain under a difficulty, a, a struggle,

185
00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:58.255
a test you are facing that you're not looking to escape it,

186
00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:01.335
not just looking for the way out,

187
00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:05.255
but in a God-honoring way, you are eager to learn the lesson

188
00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:07.295
that it was sent to teach you

189
00:10:10.895 --> 00:10:14.585
that bravely, calmly you endure.

190
00:10:15.285 --> 00:10:18.145
That's what it means to remain under, to be patient.

191
00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:22.415
And really that kind of active endurance

192
00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:25.935
is a litmus test for authentic faith.

193
00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:31.685
Said another way, it reveals the genuineness of your faith.

194
00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:36.445
Like to remain steady, to remain underneath,

195
00:10:36.705 --> 00:10:40.565
to remain under the trial is, is endurance

196
00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:42.485
showing faith?

197
00:10:44.715 --> 00:10:47.655
Is it genuine or not? Is it real or not?

198
00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:51.215
If God has allowed this trial in your

199
00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:52.735
life for a purpose, right?

200
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:54.375
God doesn't do anything without a purpose.

201
00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:57.655
If he's allowed this in your life for a purpose,

202
00:10:58.165 --> 00:11:02.695
will you remain under it as you trust him, as you look

203
00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:03.975
to him and say, okay, God, I don't understand,

204
00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:06.255
but I'm gonna trust you or will you bail?

205
00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:10.455
Because sadly,

206
00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:14.655
not all faith is true.

207
00:11:14.655 --> 00:11:18.725
Faith, you might have heard the news

208
00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:22.725
all the time, talk about people of faith around the world.

209
00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:30.135
Well if they have faith, quote unquote in a false God

210
00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:33.385
or in a false picture of the true God,

211
00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:34.945
that's not gonna sustain them.

212
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.785
That's not true. Faith, that doesn't last.

213
00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:38.345
That's not sufficient.

214
00:11:39.605 --> 00:11:41.985
So not all faith is true faith.

215
00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:44.145
This reveals the genuineness of it.

216
00:11:44.165 --> 00:11:46.345
But you also, not only just people of faith

217
00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:48.745
around the world, you also have many people within churches

218
00:11:49.245 --> 00:11:51.425
who don't have true faith

219
00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:56.525
because sadly there's been a lot of false gospels presented

220
00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:58.445
in America especially

221
00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:02.605
that just says something like God's this cosmic vending

222
00:12:02.605 --> 00:12:04.645
machine that if you just pull the right levers

223
00:12:04.645 --> 00:12:08.765
and have enough faith, enough belief, then God will give you

224
00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:12.525
whatever you want, healthy, wealthy wise, all those things.

225
00:12:12.535 --> 00:12:15.485
He'll give it to you. If you just have enough belief you

226
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.925
believe hard enough, listen,

227
00:12:17.995 --> 00:12:20.205
that doesn't have any framework for difficulties.

228
00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:21.765
It doesn't have any framework

229
00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:23.245
for when trials come in your life.

230
00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:24.605
It only causes doubts

231
00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:25.685
'cause then you're like, I'm questioning

232
00:12:25.685 --> 00:12:26.445
myself at that point.

233
00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:29.085
I don't have enough faith 'cause I'm having a hard time.

234
00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:31.045
That is false.

235
00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:39.785
Or maybe you have people sitting in churches all

236
00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:43.935
around our country, especially who,

237
00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:46.455
because it's easy to be a Christian in America.

238
00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:50.965
That's why they believe. When you got places

239
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.525
around the world where it's really hard, it's costly

240
00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:57.525
to believe in Jesus, to follow him, to say,

241
00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:00.245
you're a Christian, they have to be all in.

242
00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:03.095
We don't have that here.

243
00:13:03.395 --> 00:13:07.775
And that breeds this churchianity kind of feeling that

244
00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:08.935
that isn't true faith.

245
00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:14.255
Because here's the reality, true faith endures.

246
00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:17.915
True faith endures.

247
00:13:17.975 --> 00:13:19.515
Now, I'm not saying you can't ask questions,

248
00:13:19.615 --> 00:13:21.155
I'm not saying it won't feel really dry

249
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.915
or dark like it does right now for us as a family or,

250
00:13:23.975 --> 00:13:25.555
or it might not hurt a little bit.

251
00:13:25.655 --> 00:13:27.035
It might have to question some things,

252
00:13:27.175 --> 00:13:30.235
but patient endurance through it all it,

253
00:13:30.255 --> 00:13:32.155
it reveals a couple things.

254
00:13:34.905 --> 00:13:38.035
When you're patiently enduring trial, it shows

255
00:13:38.035 --> 00:13:40.435
that your faith is rooted in something much

256
00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:41.635
greater than circumstances.

257
00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.115
We talked about that last week with this.

258
00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:48.315
This joy and hope that you have a hope

259
00:13:48.315 --> 00:13:50.155
and something that's not just all of this work

260
00:13:50.155 --> 00:13:52.955
and outright everything's gonna be like I want it to be.

261
00:13:53.175 --> 00:13:54.595
No, my hope is in eternity.

262
00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:56.355
My hope is in a risen savior,

263
00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:58.315
a resurrected, ascended savior.

264
00:13:58.575 --> 00:14:00.315
My hope is in a return of God

265
00:14:00.315 --> 00:14:02.115
to bring his kingdom on earth as is in heaven.

266
00:14:02.295 --> 00:14:05.275
That's my hope. That's where we can patiently endure.

267
00:14:05.415 --> 00:14:07.635
It shows our hope's not here.

268
00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:11.895
This is not good. This is painful, this is hard.

269
00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:16.005
My hope's not here. Patient endurance reveals that.

270
00:14:16.985 --> 00:14:20.925
It also reveals that you believe God's promises more than

271
00:14:20.925 --> 00:14:25.045
you see your present pain in, in how it affects you.

272
00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:30.795
Like you're able to say whatever hardship I'm

273
00:14:30.795 --> 00:14:32.755
experiencing, it won't win.

274
00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:36.045
It might win in this temporary life,

275
00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:37.685
but it won't win when Jesus returns,

276
00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:39.485
it won't win on the other side of death.

277
00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:44.785
Pain doesn't win, death doesn't win. Jesus wins.

278
00:14:46.045 --> 00:14:47.905
He already has and he will.

279
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:50.705
Whatever hardship doesn't have the final say.

280
00:14:50.705 --> 00:14:53.765
That's what patient endurance shows the world.

281
00:14:57.795 --> 00:15:01.895
It also reveals your treasure's in heaven. Not here like if.

282
00:15:02.275 --> 00:15:03.895
If you're really focused,

283
00:15:03.895 --> 00:15:06.455
if I'm really focused on just making sure everything orders

284
00:15:06.555 --> 00:15:09.175
out and works out here, my treasure's here,

285
00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:10.455
which means my heart is here.

286
00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:12.535
Jesus says, no, we want a treasure to be in heaven

287
00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:14.335
where our heart then is in heaven.

288
00:15:14.525 --> 00:15:16.655
It's with him. It's something that can't be touched

289
00:15:16.955 --> 00:15:20.575
by circumstances or world wars or cancer in this world.

290
00:15:22.895 --> 00:15:25.905
It's beyond our treasures in heaven.

291
00:15:26.245 --> 00:15:30.185
If we are patiently enduring, whatever comes our way today,

292
00:15:30.405 --> 00:15:31.865
we have a treasure in heaven not here.

293
00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:39.035
And finally, it reveals that Christ

294
00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:43.195
is more precious to you than any easy life would be.

295
00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:47.895
I love how the apostle Paul wrote it.

296
00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:49.455
Philippians one 20

297
00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:54.075
and 21 May Christ be honored in my body,

298
00:15:54.465 --> 00:15:58.995
whether by life or by death, for to me to live as Christ

299
00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:02.635
and to die His gain, like his whole goal.

300
00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.915
He's like, I just want Christ to be honored.

301
00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:07.155
I don't care what happens to me, whether I live

302
00:16:07.315 --> 00:16:10.195
or die, whatever comes my way, Christ be honored,

303
00:16:10.805 --> 00:16:11.955
Jesus over everything.

304
00:16:11.955 --> 00:16:14.795
That's what he was about. Do whatever you want to me.

305
00:16:14.895 --> 00:16:15.835
As long as Christ is

306
00:16:15.835 --> 00:16:20.445
honored, is that our perspective?

307
00:16:22.575 --> 00:16:26.245
Again, patience in tribulation is one

308
00:16:26.245 --> 00:16:29.805
of the major tests of genuine faith.

309
00:16:31.965 --> 00:16:35.245
I mean Jesus said it multiple times. This is one example.

310
00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:39.405
Mark 13. 13, the one who endures to the end will be saved

311
00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:44.195
like the one who remains under everything God

312
00:16:44.195 --> 00:16:45.635
allows, doesn't bail.

313
00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:47.875
Just says, okay God, I'm in. I'm in.

314
00:16:47.995 --> 00:16:50.475
I don't know what this is. I don't like this, but I'm in.

315
00:16:51.315 --> 00:16:53.395
I believe you. I believe you're better. I'm in.

316
00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:56.825
Lemme just think of Job.

317
00:16:57.765 --> 00:17:02.345
The Old Testament example of job that God allowed Satan

318
00:17:02.445 --> 00:17:04.745
to test job in massive ways

319
00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:07.665
Like job job's.

320
00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:10.665
A wealthy man like Job is the picture of everything

321
00:17:11.185 --> 00:17:13.465
American dream wants, right?

322
00:17:13.495 --> 00:17:15.025
He's got all the money, he's got a great

323
00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:16.385
family, he's got the reputation.

324
00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.385
He's known well for being.

325
00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:19.865
He's got it all together

326
00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:23.525
and then God allows Satan to test him

327
00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:26.045
and he loses everything.

328
00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:30.525
He loses his children. He has boils on his skin.

329
00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:34.765
All of that. And yet listen to job,

330
00:17:37.305 --> 00:17:38.445
job 1315.

331
00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:43.005
Though he slay me, I will hope in him

332
00:17:46.495 --> 00:17:48.465
like even if

333
00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:54.005
the worst thing comes where I am killed,

334
00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:57.845
I'm gonna remain under the trial

335
00:17:58.635 --> 00:18:02.245
because I'm trusting my God for resolution.

336
00:18:03.645 --> 00:18:05.645
I dunno what it looks like. Even if it means I died.

337
00:18:05.665 --> 00:18:08.165
The resolution is I get to be with him.

338
00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:10.325
I'll see my redeemer face to face.

339
00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:13.925
He said later like, that's his hope not in man.

340
00:18:13.925 --> 00:18:16.285
I hope I get my family back. I hope I get my stuff back.

341
00:18:17.715 --> 00:18:18.775
No God, I'm trusting you.

342
00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:22.015
Even if it means the worst, I'm trusting you.

343
00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:24.775
I will praise you in the trial

344
00:18:27.925 --> 00:18:30.025
or or think of how God's word describes people

345
00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:31.065
who are killed for their faith.

346
00:18:31.335 --> 00:18:33.905
This is the, the word martyr is thrown around.

347
00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.385
That's what people are killed for their faith.

348
00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:39.305
Revelation 12, 11 says they loved not their lives,

349
00:18:39.455 --> 00:18:40.465
even unto death.

350
00:18:42.095 --> 00:18:46.935
Like They counted their life as nothing, even

351
00:18:47.045 --> 00:18:50.255
with the the whatever coming their way

352
00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:51.495
that was about to take their life.

353
00:18:53.515 --> 00:18:57.405
Like, ah, that's not it. I'm gonna die. This isn't it?

354
00:18:57.475 --> 00:19:00.565
This isn't all there is. I love him more. I love Jesus more.

355
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.205
I see Jesus better. I'm willing

356
00:19:02.205 --> 00:19:05.805
to endure whatever it is here because Jesus is better.

357
00:19:05.905 --> 00:19:06.965
Is that our perspective?

358
00:19:10.705 --> 00:19:12.445
And so think about what kind of trials

359
00:19:12.545 --> 00:19:14.525
and tribulations are you facing right now.

360
00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:18.905
Could be any number of things, right?

361
00:19:19.145 --> 00:19:20.425
I don't know all the stories in this room.

362
00:19:20.465 --> 00:19:22.905
I know some, but like what are you facing right now?

363
00:19:22.935 --> 00:19:25.145
What trials, struggles, tribulations,

364
00:19:25.545 --> 00:19:27.265
difficulties are you facing right now?

365
00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:28.265
It could be a whole lot of things.

366
00:19:28.265 --> 00:19:30.185
Doesn't have to be as big as this that I'm talking.

367
00:19:30.245 --> 00:19:31.345
It could be all kinds.

368
00:19:31.935 --> 00:19:36.745
What are you facing when you think about your

369
00:19:37.225 --> 00:19:39.065
response to those difficulties though?

370
00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:45.255
What is that teaching you about the depth of your faith?

371
00:19:46.075 --> 00:19:49.345
How Are you responding to those trials?

372
00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:55.805
Are you remaining under it with joy?

373
00:19:57.415 --> 00:19:59.605
Maybe not always a smile on your face, but

374
00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:01.085
but with hope in the Lord.

375
00:20:01.085 --> 00:20:02.165
Are you remaining under it? Say,

376
00:20:02.165 --> 00:20:03.205
God, okay, I don't understand.

377
00:20:03.225 --> 00:20:04.325
I'm gonna follow you.

378
00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:09.075
Or are you complaining?

379
00:20:10.495 --> 00:20:15.355
Are you wanting to bail? Are you doubting God's goodness?

380
00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:21.975
What's your response show about the depth of your faith?

381
00:20:24.665 --> 00:20:26.025
I once heard somebody say it this way.

382
00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:30.865
I never understood that Christ was all I needed

383
00:20:32.345 --> 00:20:34.615
until Christ was all I had left.

384
00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:40.755
Everything else is gone. Everything is stripped away.

385
00:20:42.645 --> 00:20:45.505
All you have is Christ. That's when you learn.

386
00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:47.965
He's All, all I needed anyway.

387
00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:51.655
Take all this others, take the rest of it all.

388
00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:53.255
I don't need anything but him.

389
00:20:53.355 --> 00:20:55.815
He is sufficient and so lean into him.

390
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:03.145
But listen, I get it. I'm not standing up here

391
00:21:03.145 --> 00:21:04.185
saying, I got all this figured out.

392
00:21:05.805 --> 00:21:07.105
I'm in process with you.

393
00:21:07.245 --> 00:21:11.615
And it can be difficult to endure sufferings,

394
00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:14.535
to endure tribulations patiently.

395
00:21:16.595 --> 00:21:20.545
Especially when you have trouble seeing the purpose

396
00:21:21.925 --> 00:21:24.575
day to day, right?

397
00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.215
We ask that question a lot over the last six years.

398
00:21:26.215 --> 00:21:31.175
Like, what? What? What are you doing? God, why? Why?

399
00:21:31.685 --> 00:21:34.455
That question? Why comes up a lot, doesn't it?

400
00:21:37.855 --> 00:21:40.025
Well, I wrote this down because I need to remember this

401
00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:42.625
and I assuming you need to remember this too.

402
00:21:44.715 --> 00:21:46.705
Those trials and tribulations that we face

403
00:21:47.525 --> 00:21:52.255
Are Not meaningless in the economy of a good God.

404
00:21:54.305 --> 00:21:56.995
They're not just happenings, they're not just stuff.

405
00:21:57.025 --> 00:22:00.595
They're not just hardship. They are with a purpose.

406
00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:05.385
And so, so listen, the main

407
00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:09.665
hardship is God's workshop

408
00:22:10.485 --> 00:22:12.705
for spiritual formation in our lives.

409
00:22:17.655 --> 00:22:21.225
It's one of the main ways that God uses to refine

410
00:22:21.885 --> 00:22:24.305
us into the image of Christ.

411
00:22:24.365 --> 00:22:28.825
And when we patiently endure, we take this up,

412
00:22:28.845 --> 00:22:30.705
we remain under it, we patiently endure

413
00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:32.225
and we're walking through it.

414
00:22:32.445 --> 00:22:34.225
That's how God is accomplishing

415
00:22:34.225 --> 00:22:36.945
that refining work in our hearts, in our lives.

416
00:22:36.945 --> 00:22:38.905
That's what he's doing. It's how he's doing it.

417
00:22:41.705 --> 00:22:44.155
Like they're his tools. This is his workshop.

418
00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:46.955
Trials are God's purposeful tools

419
00:22:46.975 --> 00:22:48.835
to conform us into the image of Christ.

420
00:22:50.475 --> 00:22:51.525
They're not meaningless.

421
00:22:53.845 --> 00:22:57.975
It's the primary way that he is realigning us, right?

422
00:22:58.045 --> 00:23:00.735
He's realigning us back to the perfect vertical of Jesus.

423
00:23:01.155 --> 00:23:02.975
His trials. It's sufferings.

424
00:23:02.975 --> 00:23:04.535
That is the primary way He does

425
00:23:04.535 --> 00:23:09.125
that 'cause.

426
00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:10.165
Think about how he does it.

427
00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:12.925
Think about what he does through trials in our lives.

428
00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:18.285
He uses tribulations to make us more humble.

429
00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:23.715
Again, it's hard for me to suffer privately.

430
00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:25.675
You've seen this over the last few years, right?

431
00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:30.665
The vertigo thing, When I had vertigo for months,

432
00:23:30.805 --> 00:23:32.385
God was using that to humble me.

433
00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:34.545
My knee year and a half, still not right.

434
00:23:34.575 --> 00:23:36.185
Like what's going on there? I don't know.

435
00:23:36.205 --> 00:23:37.625
But you know what God was teaching me?

436
00:23:37.695 --> 00:23:39.905
He's saying, Hey, stop trusting yourself, brother.

437
00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:43.515
Stop trusting your body being right.

438
00:23:43.515 --> 00:23:46.645
Like it's not about that. It's it's about me. My strength.

439
00:23:46.705 --> 00:23:48.205
In fact, this is what Paul says.

440
00:23:48.305 --> 00:23:52.605
Second Corinthians chapter 12, listen to how he says it.

441
00:23:54.435 --> 00:23:56.575
So to keep me from becoming conceited

442
00:23:56.575 --> 00:23:58.615
because of the surpassing greatness, the revelations,

443
00:23:58.935 --> 00:24:01.175
a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan

444
00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:03.615
to harass me, to keep me from becoming

445
00:24:03.615 --> 00:24:06.135
conceited, to humble me.

446
00:24:06.155 --> 00:24:11.095
He says, now notice it's not wrong to pray for

447
00:24:11.095 --> 00:24:12.215
that thorn to be removed.

448
00:24:12.225 --> 00:24:13.735
Three times I pleaded

449
00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:15.695
with the Lord about this, that it should leave me.

450
00:24:16.525 --> 00:24:19.735
It's not sinful to to plead with the Lord to remove pain.

451
00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:23.325
It's okay, but watch the response.

452
00:24:23.905 --> 00:24:27.765
But he said to me, my grace is sufficient for you,

453
00:24:28.585 --> 00:24:30.725
for my power is made perfect in weakness.

454
00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:35.635
Therefore, Paul says, I will boast all the more gladly

455
00:24:35.815 --> 00:24:37.595
of my weaknesses so that the power

456
00:24:37.615 --> 00:24:40.195
of Christ may rest upon me.

457
00:24:41.695 --> 00:24:46.275
He has to humble us so that his power can show off more

458
00:24:46.275 --> 00:24:47.395
through our weakness.

459
00:24:47.655 --> 00:24:48.955
Why do we stand up here and think,

460
00:24:49.095 --> 00:24:50.955
why do you stand up in life and think like, man,

461
00:24:50.955 --> 00:24:52.035
I gotta put it all together.

462
00:24:52.035 --> 00:24:52.835
I gotta make sure everybody else

463
00:24:52.835 --> 00:24:53.715
thinks I have it all together.

464
00:24:54.055 --> 00:24:57.155
No, his powers made perfect through our weakness.

465
00:24:59.195 --> 00:25:03.015
Trials humble us so that he is shown

466
00:25:03.675 --> 00:25:05.735
to be more and more powerful.

467
00:25:09.105 --> 00:25:12.565
Trials conform us in our character.

468
00:25:13.835 --> 00:25:16.565
This is how Romans five, three through five says it.

469
00:25:17.465 --> 00:25:20.845
Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings

470
00:25:22.305 --> 00:25:25.155
knowing that suffering produces endurance.

471
00:25:26.235 --> 00:25:29.965
Endurance produces character. And character produces hope.

472
00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:31.605
And hope does not put us to shame

473
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:33.605
'cause God's love's been poured into our hearts

474
00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:36.565
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

475
00:25:37.835 --> 00:25:41.605
He's making us more like Jesus through suffering,

476
00:25:41.815 --> 00:25:45.125
which then leads to patient endurance, which leads

477
00:25:45.145 --> 00:25:49.785
to character characters like Jesus leading

478
00:25:49.785 --> 00:25:54.115
to our hope being in something more than this world, right?

479
00:25:54.115 --> 00:25:57.115
That's what he's doing. He's doing that through suffering

480
00:25:57.255 --> 00:26:00.675
and he's doing it so that we would know Christ more deeply.

481
00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:02.675
And we know Christ more deeply

482
00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:06.075
as we actually share his sufferings.

483
00:26:06.075 --> 00:26:09.475
That's Philippians three, verse 10 that I may know him

484
00:26:09.855 --> 00:26:11.555
and the power of his resurrection.

485
00:26:11.555 --> 00:26:16.435
We want that of course, and may share his sufferings

486
00:26:18.305 --> 00:26:20.465
becoming like him in his death.

487
00:26:25.385 --> 00:26:29.125
So you see God's good purpose in trials.

488
00:26:31.405 --> 00:26:32.465
He, he's got a purpose.

489
00:26:36.335 --> 00:26:38.115
We can't bail on the process though,

490
00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:42.475
because if we bail on the process, we short circuit

491
00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:46.965
what God was intending to do in our lives through the pain.

492
00:26:49.805 --> 00:26:54.025
That's why I love James chapter one verses two through four.

493
00:26:54.205 --> 00:26:55.625
It talks about this process.

494
00:26:56.605 --> 00:27:00.425
He says, count it all joy my brothers, when you meet trials

495
00:27:00.425 --> 00:27:03.465
of various kinds, I count it joy.

496
00:27:03.645 --> 00:27:07.975
Do we do that? Hey, here comes a trial.

497
00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:11.455
Yes. Like, is that what we're no. Or like, that's not us.

498
00:27:11.595 --> 00:27:12.975
But watch this counter at all joy.

499
00:27:12.975 --> 00:27:15.335
When you meet trials of various kinds for you know

500
00:27:15.685 --> 00:27:19.175
that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness

501
00:27:19.175 --> 00:27:22.815
endurance and let steadfastness have its

502
00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:26.155
full effect that you may be perfect

503
00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:28.555
and complete lacking in nothing.

504
00:27:30.705 --> 00:27:32.805
It sounds like remaining under the trial, right?

505
00:27:32.835 --> 00:27:35.125
Like Romans 12 says, remain under it.

506
00:27:35.345 --> 00:27:38.645
Let it have its full effect. In other words, don't bail.

507
00:27:39.785 --> 00:27:42.845
Let it work. Let it do what it's going to do. Why?

508
00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:46.285
Because you want what God is intending for you to have

509
00:27:46.435 --> 00:27:48.405
that you would be full, complete,

510
00:27:48.675 --> 00:27:50.845
lacking nothing in your spiritual life.

511
00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:53.645
How do you get to that point? You gotta walk the journey.

512
00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:56.125
You gotta walk the process.

513
00:27:56.585 --> 00:28:00.805
You can't, like Mario Kart shortcuts across the the river

514
00:28:01.065 --> 00:28:03.885
to get to the, my kids were beating me by like 30 seconds

515
00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:06.085
and I don't know how they shortcut everything, okay?

516
00:28:06.305 --> 00:28:08.085
But this is what we can't do in life.

517
00:28:10.225 --> 00:28:11.765
We can't short circuit

518
00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:15.845
shortcut the work God is doing in your life

519
00:28:15.845 --> 00:28:19.125
because then you're gonna miss what God is teaching you

520
00:28:19.355 --> 00:28:20.355
Through it.

521
00:28:24.275 --> 00:28:28.935
And I know, I know that can hurt. It can hurt real bad.

522
00:28:31.295 --> 00:28:35.315
That's why I love Hebrews the way Hebrews

523
00:28:35.315 --> 00:28:36.555
12 verse 11 says it.

524
00:28:37.985 --> 00:28:39.915
This is talking about disciplining our sin,

525
00:28:40.035 --> 00:28:43.275
but think discipline of, of formation of life.

526
00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:45.355
It applies here, watch this for the moment.

527
00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:50.235
All discipline seems painful rather than pleasant.

528
00:28:51.255 --> 00:28:54.875
But later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness

529
00:28:55.655 --> 00:28:57.355
to those who have been trained

530
00:28:57.855 --> 00:28:58.855
By it.

531
00:28:59.785 --> 00:29:02.155
Like that's, that's a process training.

532
00:29:03.625 --> 00:29:05.915
It's not fun in the middle of it,

533
00:29:06.895 --> 00:29:10.755
but it yields fruit on the other side in big ways.

534
00:29:14.515 --> 00:29:18.015
You might not be aware of how they refine and purify gold.

535
00:29:18.895 --> 00:29:21.095
I didn't, so I had to look it up.

536
00:29:21.095 --> 00:29:23.375
There's a process called the miller process.

537
00:29:26.335 --> 00:29:28.455
'cause gold doesn't come outta the ground pure.

538
00:29:29.915 --> 00:29:31.415
It has impurities in it.

539
00:29:32.315 --> 00:29:34.295
And so what they do is they, they put

540
00:29:34.295 --> 00:29:38.055
that crude gold in a container and then they heat it

541
00:29:38.395 --> 00:29:39.735
and they melt it down.

542
00:29:40.275 --> 00:29:42.365
And then they treat that with chloride

543
00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:45.485
because the chloride mixes with the zinc

544
00:29:45.585 --> 00:29:46.925
and the copper and the iron.

545
00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:49.565
That's all in that crude ore.

546
00:29:49.785 --> 00:29:51.765
And those things link to the chloride.

547
00:29:51.785 --> 00:29:55.325
And what that does is it leeches out of the gold as draws.

548
00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:58.565
And so as it's heated up, that stuff rises to the surface

549
00:29:58.665 --> 00:29:59.765
and they scrape it off.

550
00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:04.455
And what is left behind progressively more pure

551
00:30:05.165 --> 00:30:08.765
gold, heat it up, melted down,

552
00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:10.365
mix the chloride in there.

553
00:30:10.505 --> 00:30:13.045
It leeches out the bad stuff. They scrape it off.

554
00:30:13.515 --> 00:30:16.085
More pure, more pure, more pure gold.

555
00:30:21.015 --> 00:30:24.595
Listen to one Peter one

556
00:30:25.455 --> 00:30:29.035
verses six and seven describe a similar process

557
00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:32.785
in our lives in this.

558
00:30:32.805 --> 00:30:35.585
You rejoice though now for a little while if necessary.

559
00:30:35.585 --> 00:30:38.505
You have been grieved by various trials

560
00:30:40.575 --> 00:30:44.275
so that the tested genuineness of your faith

561
00:30:45.505 --> 00:30:49.075
more precious than gold, that perishes, though it is tested

562
00:30:49.295 --> 00:30:54.065
by fire, may be found a result in praise and glory

563
00:30:54.065 --> 00:30:56.985
and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

564
00:30:57.525 --> 00:30:58.625
Did you see what he said?

565
00:30:58.845 --> 00:31:03.265
He said, God is using the trials in our lives as the heat

566
00:31:03.725 --> 00:31:04.745
to refine us

567
00:31:05.045 --> 00:31:09.505
and purify us, removing the sinful dross in our lives

568
00:31:09.845 --> 00:31:13.305
so that we look progressively more like Jesus.

569
00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:19.835
Your trials have a purpose.

570
00:31:22.355 --> 00:31:26.975
Your trials are meant by God to refine you.

571
00:31:30.965 --> 00:31:34.105
But there's one more way that God works through our trials,

572
00:31:36.385 --> 00:31:39.835
through our patient endurance in the trial, God uses that

573
00:31:40.215 --> 00:31:43.235
to display his glory to the world.

574
00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:49.345
He displays his glory through our patient endurance

575
00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:51.825
to the world around us.

576
00:31:55.375 --> 00:31:56.995
The Bible uses another word elsewhere

577
00:31:57.095 --> 00:31:58.515
for this idea of patience.

578
00:31:58.905 --> 00:32:00.715
It's the word long suffering.

579
00:32:01.995 --> 00:32:03.295
We don't use that very often,

580
00:32:03.435 --> 00:32:05.575
but it's, it is a,

581
00:32:07.195 --> 00:32:11.035
a very accurate term, long suffering.

582
00:32:13.205 --> 00:32:16.295
Hear me, your long suffering

583
00:32:17.475 --> 00:32:20.975
is a powerful apologetic for Christianity.

584
00:32:22.235 --> 00:32:24.655
It is a defense of our faith.

585
00:32:24.725 --> 00:32:28.895
When you suffer long, when Christians endure trials

586
00:32:28.965 --> 00:32:32.895
with patient faith, they become living demonstrations

587
00:32:33.155 --> 00:32:35.295
of God's sustaining power

588
00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:38.575
and his supreme worth to a world that's watching

589
00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:43.185
Like you are a example of what it means.

590
00:32:43.185 --> 00:32:45.425
It's like it's evangelism through suffering.

591
00:32:47.595 --> 00:32:49.655
And I think, man, why is my life so hard?

592
00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:51.135
Maybe it's like, no, instead,

593
00:32:51.395 --> 00:32:53.775
why did God give you such a platform from which

594
00:32:53.835 --> 00:32:55.615
to speak about his glory and goodness?

595
00:32:57.655 --> 00:33:01.205
Evangelism through suffering an easy life may not have the

596
00:33:01.205 --> 00:33:04.045
best platform, but a hard life struggle trial

597
00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:07.765
that shows the Lord off to the world around us.

598
00:33:08.075 --> 00:33:10.325
It's like what Paul said, two Timothy two 10.

599
00:33:10.325 --> 00:33:12.685
He said, I'm gonna endure everything for the sake

600
00:33:12.685 --> 00:33:15.445
of the elect, like for the sake of evangelism

601
00:33:15.505 --> 00:33:17.365
to see the gospel go to those people,

602
00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.965
that God's ordained to be saved.

603
00:33:19.235 --> 00:33:21.365
I'll endure whatever, everything,

604
00:33:21.605 --> 00:33:23.445
I don't care, whatever you would do to me.

605
00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:28.015
As long as people hear about the the gospel, man,

606
00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:33.335
that's, that's a heart we want to have.

607
00:33:34.855 --> 00:33:37.185
I'll endure everything for the sake

608
00:33:37.685 --> 00:33:39.425
of the gospel going forth.

609
00:33:40.225 --> 00:33:43.515
Because here's what, here's what patient endurance does.

610
00:33:43.515 --> 00:33:46.075
Here's how it glorifies God at first.

611
00:33:46.175 --> 00:33:49.835
It shows God's power, super na, your supernatural ability

612
00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:52.635
to endure it just proves that God's in you.

613
00:33:52.845 --> 00:33:54.875
God's grace is with you that you can make it

614
00:33:55.155 --> 00:33:57.275
'cause people look at you like, how in the world did you go

615
00:33:57.275 --> 00:33:59.475
through that and still have joy?

616
00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:04.205
Only God? It proves God's grace

617
00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:06.645
and God's glory and God's power as you endure,

618
00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:09.125
it demonstrates God's worth.

619
00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:12.245
Like you think about persecution, your willingness

620
00:34:12.245 --> 00:34:16.325
to suffer rather than deny God is actually

621
00:34:16.495 --> 00:34:17.965
testifying to his glory.

622
00:34:21.155 --> 00:34:23.075
I, I wrote that and I, I thought of Peter,

623
00:34:25.175 --> 00:34:26.355
you remember Peter on the night,

624
00:34:26.355 --> 00:34:27.635
Jesus was betrayed the night

625
00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:30.675
before he was crucified, Jesus was taken and he arrested

626
00:34:30.675 --> 00:34:32.355
and he went through all these series of trials.

627
00:34:33.305 --> 00:34:36.555
Well, there was one scene where Peter was like outside

628
00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:38.755
around a fire with a bunch of people

629
00:34:40.015 --> 00:34:41.915
and these people look across the fire

630
00:34:42.415 --> 00:34:43.555
at Peter and they're like,

631
00:34:44.855 --> 00:34:47.915
Hey, I, I think you were with him, weren't you?

632
00:34:49.745 --> 00:34:53.205
How did Peter respond? I don't know him.

633
00:34:53.785 --> 00:34:55.245
No man, I don't know that guy.

634
00:34:56.965 --> 00:34:59.005
I swear I never spent any time with him.

635
00:34:59.125 --> 00:35:03.085
I don't know who that guy is. What was Peter doing?

636
00:35:05.055 --> 00:35:07.915
Of course, he was denying Jesus, but he was, what was he?

637
00:35:07.915 --> 00:35:09.275
What was he want? I'm right there with him, man.

638
00:35:09.275 --> 00:35:10.435
Like what was he wanting to avoid?

639
00:35:11.745 --> 00:35:13.635
Getting arrested and getting crucified

640
00:35:13.635 --> 00:35:14.835
like Jesus was about to get.

641
00:35:15.455 --> 00:35:16.875
He was wanting to avoid suffering.

642
00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:20.195
He was just saying, man, that's gonna cost me a lot for me

643
00:35:20.195 --> 00:35:21.355
to stand up in the moment.

644
00:35:22.015 --> 00:35:24.315
But listen, in the moment, he didn't see Jesus

645
00:35:24.495 --> 00:35:25.955
as his most valuable treasure.

646
00:35:27.715 --> 00:35:30.015
He instead wanted comfort to protect, to

647
00:35:30.735 --> 00:35:31.735
Shield.

648
00:35:33.095 --> 00:35:37.565
When we endure patiently, what we show the world is

649
00:35:37.565 --> 00:35:40.245
that God is worth everything.

650
00:35:43.915 --> 00:35:47.605
Another way it reveals God's character like

651
00:35:47.605 --> 00:35:49.005
so think someone's oppressing,

652
00:35:49.005 --> 00:35:50.685
think someone's bringing a trial in your life.

653
00:35:51.075 --> 00:35:53.445
Your patient love for them

654
00:35:54.715 --> 00:35:58.965
even when they're attacking you is an illustration

655
00:35:58.985 --> 00:36:01.885
of God's patient, love for us as his enemy,

656
00:36:03.355 --> 00:36:04.365
that he loved us.

657
00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:06.685
We don't deserve it, we shouldn't be loved, but he did.

658
00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:08.885
Anyway. When you take someone who's coming at you

659
00:36:08.905 --> 00:36:12.485
and you love them like Jesus loved you, think of the way

660
00:36:12.485 --> 00:36:14.805
that shows God off to the world.

661
00:36:18.395 --> 00:36:22.285
Finally, it points to future glory like your hope

662
00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:24.925
and suffering today testifies to eternity.

663
00:36:25.405 --> 00:36:27.405
Remember, Jesus did say, you will have trouble

664
00:36:27.595 --> 00:36:28.925
here, but he didn't stop there.

665
00:36:29.065 --> 00:36:31.765
He says, you'll have trouble in this world, but take heart.

666
00:36:32.325 --> 00:36:34.885
I have overcome this world.

667
00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:38.445
There is a hope that is future.

668
00:36:38.735 --> 00:36:41.765
There is something that we're hoping and trusting

669
00:36:41.765 --> 00:36:44.805
and leaning on that is far beyond all this working out here.

670
00:36:45.065 --> 00:36:46.965
It is future oriented

671
00:36:47.235 --> 00:36:51.125
that only comes when we have hope in him.

672
00:36:52.945 --> 00:36:56.965
Future glory, your patient endurance points to God's glory.

673
00:36:57.185 --> 00:36:59.845
So hear me, unbelievers are watching

674
00:37:00.225 --> 00:37:02.245
how Christians respond

675
00:37:02.665 --> 00:37:07.665
to tribulation. So what are they seeing?

676
00:37:08.675 --> 00:37:11.865
What Are they looking at?

677
00:37:12.045 --> 00:37:14.545
How are, how are they seeing Christians

678
00:37:15.215 --> 00:37:17.145
respond to trial?

679
00:37:20.345 --> 00:37:22.245
Do they see Christians flying off the handle,

680
00:37:25.805 --> 00:37:29.005
spouting off speaking negatively about groups of people,

681
00:37:29.475 --> 00:37:32.765
like really angry about things, complaining about this

682
00:37:32.825 --> 00:37:34.845
or that or the way the state of the world is?

683
00:37:34.865 --> 00:37:36.125
Are they seeking revenge?

684
00:37:36.585 --> 00:37:38.645
Are they manipulating to get victory?

685
00:37:38.955 --> 00:37:41.365
Like are, are they seeing Christians act like that

686
00:37:45.705 --> 00:37:50.325
or do they see believers with this joy

687
00:37:51.025 --> 00:37:55.965
and hope and love in the midst of suffering,

688
00:37:56.785 --> 00:38:00.365
in the midst of the world falling apart, in the midst

689
00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:03.525
of all these hard things?

690
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:07.605
That is the response that can only be explained

691
00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:11.045
by a sovereign good God working in those people.

692
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:15.275
The other way is the way of the world.

693
00:38:15.775 --> 00:38:19.035
That's how everyone naturally responds.

694
00:38:19.265 --> 00:38:21.915
This is only supernatural

695
00:38:25.005 --> 00:38:27.665
and it makes me think of, of the first martyr, Stephen,

696
00:38:29.135 --> 00:38:30.825
This Is in Acts chapter seven.

697
00:38:31.815 --> 00:38:35.105
Stephen was being executed for defending Jesus,

698
00:38:35.545 --> 00:38:36.685
for defending the gospel

699
00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:41.805
and as he is being killed, he looked into heaven

700
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:45.885
and he looked at Jesus with joy, like

701
00:38:45.985 --> 00:38:49.805
as the rocks are crushing his body, he looked up

702
00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:53.045
and he had a hope in something beyond all of this.

703
00:38:53.185 --> 00:38:56.205
He had a hope and a joy. His face was shining.

704
00:38:56.545 --> 00:38:59.245
It says, and listen, you know who was there,

705
00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:03.845
you know who was overseeing the whole

706
00:39:03.995 --> 00:39:08.135
process. A young man named

707
00:39:08.645 --> 00:39:13.155
Saul Who just a few verses later

708
00:39:14.055 --> 00:39:16.355
was met by the ascended Jesus.

709
00:39:16.935 --> 00:39:18.755
He changed his whole heart

710
00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:21.395
and he made him into the greatest missionary we've ever

711
00:39:21.395 --> 00:39:22.595
known named Paul

712
00:39:25.885 --> 00:39:30.265
and Paul later records how he looked back at Stephen's life

713
00:39:31.685 --> 00:39:34.865
as a formative moment in his journey.

714
00:39:38.805 --> 00:39:42.525
So don't miss this. Your patient endurance

715
00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:45.445
and tribulation is not just about you,

716
00:39:47.325 --> 00:39:51.775
You, Yeah, you grow, you're in, you're refined.

717
00:39:51.775 --> 00:39:54.415
You're more like Jesus. Your faith is proven like gold.

718
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:56.895
Yes, those are huge, good, important things,

719
00:39:57.115 --> 00:40:01.095
but your endurance is also how the world around us

720
00:40:01.625 --> 00:40:04.535
knows about and sees and understands who God is.

721
00:40:06.235 --> 00:40:07.405
It's how they see.

722
00:40:07.625 --> 00:40:09.485
So think about, think about the power

723
00:40:09.545 --> 00:40:12.005
of stability in a world of chaos.

724
00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:16.455
Think about how you,

725
00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:20.015
you keeping your head when everyone else is losing their

726
00:40:20.105 --> 00:40:22.215
minds, you're keeping your head how

727
00:40:22.245 --> 00:40:24.655
that shows something very different

728
00:40:25.475 --> 00:40:26.935
in your trust in the Lord.

729
00:40:31.615 --> 00:40:34.155
And so just consider for a second how those

730
00:40:34.215 --> 00:40:37.075
who are watching you respond to trials.

731
00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:40.945
How do they see you handle those? How are they watching?

732
00:40:40.965 --> 00:40:43.785
How will they watch you handle tribulation?

733
00:40:43.925 --> 00:40:48.625
Are they seeing that Jesus is worthy of unwavering trust?

734
00:40:49.015 --> 00:40:51.105
Even in the darkest circumstances,

735
00:40:51.255 --> 00:40:52.865
even when everything's fallen apart,

736
00:40:53.045 --> 00:40:54.265
the world is going to war.

737
00:40:54.265 --> 00:40:56.065
Everything's falling apart in your family,

738
00:40:56.255 --> 00:40:57.665
your body is dying

739
00:40:57.925 --> 00:41:01.465
and they see you that Jesus is worthy of trust.

740
00:41:02.445 --> 00:41:06.695
Do they see that and does your response

741
00:41:06.695 --> 00:41:09.295
to suffering communicate the worth of following Christ

742
00:41:09.635 --> 00:41:12.175
or are you only following because it's easy?

743
00:41:14.965 --> 00:41:17.825
Do you see him as worthy again,

744
00:41:17.845 --> 00:41:19.265
the struggles see the purpose.

745
00:41:19.535 --> 00:41:20.905
It's how God is working in you.

746
00:41:21.015 --> 00:41:22.745
It's how God is working through you.

747
00:41:22.965 --> 00:41:25.905
So trust that your tribulation has some meaning

748
00:41:26.615 --> 00:41:30.025
that he is not wasting your pain

749
00:41:31.495 --> 00:41:35.845
and believe that the same spirit who strengthened Jesus

750
00:41:35.985 --> 00:41:38.885
to face the tribulation he faced is the same spirit

751
00:41:38.885 --> 00:41:40.045
that will strengthen you

752
00:41:40.105 --> 00:41:41.765
to face the tribulation you're facing.

753
00:41:43.715 --> 00:41:44.845
Lean into him for that.

754
00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:52.085
Here's, here's the verse. Revelation 1412, here is a call

755
00:41:52.385 --> 00:41:54.605
for the endurance of the saints,

756
00:41:57.585 --> 00:41:59.125
the saints Christians.

757
00:41:59.305 --> 00:42:04.125
Here's a call. Endurance faith in

758
00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:06.365
Jesus is endurance,

759
00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:09.845
and so let's lean into them for that right now for his help.

760
00:42:10.065 --> 00:42:12.485
If you would pray with me towards that end.

761
00:42:25.205 --> 00:42:26.925
I don't know the stories in the room right now.

762
00:42:27.285 --> 00:42:30.685
I know some, but I don't know what you walked in here with

763
00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:34.245
or or what you're facing at home, at work,

764
00:42:34.465 --> 00:42:37.885
at your bank account physically,

765
00:42:38.045 --> 00:42:41.685
I don't know, but God does.

766
00:42:45.745 --> 00:42:48.565
He knows what stuff was suffering.

767
00:42:49.095 --> 00:42:52.045
Feels like Jesus took the suffering for us.

768
00:42:54.345 --> 00:42:58.485
So he's not some separated deity. He's involved.

769
00:42:58.485 --> 00:43:00.285
We sang Psalms 23 earlier.

770
00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:02.205
He's in the middle of the valley

771
00:43:02.225 --> 00:43:03.285
of the shadow of death with you.

772
00:43:03.465 --> 00:43:08.005
So in this, listen, in this as you pray, run to him.

773
00:43:08.095 --> 00:43:09.405
Maybe you felt overwhelmed.

774
00:43:09.405 --> 00:43:11.925
Maybe you felt like you have no hope. Listen, there is hope.

775
00:43:15.555 --> 00:43:16.725
He's doing something in you

776
00:43:16.865 --> 00:43:20.165
and he's doing something through you no matter

777
00:43:20.165 --> 00:43:20.925
what you face right now,

778
00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:26.245
and maybe you've just felt like

779
00:43:26.245 --> 00:43:27.525
there's no way you can go on.

780
00:43:27.985 --> 00:43:30.725
My prayer has been that today God would fill you

781
00:43:30.725 --> 00:43:33.085
with his spirit in such a way that you can't help

782
00:43:33.185 --> 00:43:36.205
but notice He has strengthened you more than you had

783
00:43:36.205 --> 00:43:39.445
yesterday And then you run back to him

784
00:43:39.445 --> 00:43:41.845
and tomorrow you strengthened more than you were today

785
00:43:42.265 --> 00:43:45.445
and beyond as we go, until the day he returns.

786
00:43:51.145 --> 00:43:53.205
And maybe you just need to acknowledge your weakness right

787
00:43:53.205 --> 00:43:55.925
now, like two Corinthians 12.

788
00:43:55.925 --> 00:44:00.245
Acknowledge that you're weak, but that's what he wants.

789
00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.245
His strength is made perfect in that weakness.

790
00:44:05.185 --> 00:44:07.885
His power is shown through our weakness,

791
00:44:08.065 --> 00:44:09.525
and so just run him.

792
00:44:09.835 --> 00:44:13.045
Take off the veneer, the facade, the the mask

793
00:44:13.465 --> 00:44:15.725
of having it all together and just say, Jesus, I need you.

794
00:44:17.985 --> 00:44:19.645
You are my hope, not this world,

795
00:44:19.865 --> 00:44:21.365
not the things working out as it should.

796
00:44:21.905 --> 00:44:23.965
Not that that everything is comfortable.

797
00:44:24.305 --> 00:44:26.765
That's not my hope because that's so fickle.

798
00:44:28.105 --> 00:44:30.765
God, you are my hope. And just believe that.

799
00:44:31.275 --> 00:44:34.565
Tell yourself, remind yourself. Look to his word.

800
00:44:34.795 --> 00:44:36.885
Look to the gospel. Look to the life, death

801
00:44:36.885 --> 00:44:38.645
and resurrection of Jesus's proof.

802
00:44:38.955 --> 00:44:39.645
Look to him.

803
00:44:43.755 --> 00:44:45.845
He's our living hope because it didn't just stop

804
00:44:46.075 --> 00:44:49.245
with the death of Jesus on the cross for our sins.

805
00:44:49.505 --> 00:44:53.765
It continued with the resurrection of Jesus to defeat sin

806
00:44:53.765 --> 00:44:57.645
and death, the ascension of Jesus to set up a future hope

807
00:44:57.785 --> 00:45:01.325
for us and afu, uh, soon coming return for us

808
00:45:01.385 --> 00:45:02.485
to be home with him forever.

809
00:45:02.755 --> 00:45:06.285
That is our living hope, which means you can live today

810
00:45:06.475 --> 00:45:11.445
with hope, With joy, with

811
00:45:12.925 --> 00:45:16.085
anticipation of what he's gonna do through

812
00:45:16.745 --> 00:45:18.445
the hard season you're in.

813
00:45:19.545 --> 00:45:21.845
Do you see it like that? If not, just run to him.

814
00:45:22.505 --> 00:45:25.965
Ask him for faith to believe it. We need that at,

815
00:45:29.035 --> 00:45:30.965
Because Here's what James one 12 says.

816
00:45:30.965 --> 00:45:34.045
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial

817
00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:37.125
for when he has stood the test, he'll receive the crown

818
00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:39.245
of life which God has promised to those who love him.

819
00:45:39.245 --> 00:45:41.685
That's what's coming for you believer.

820
00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:43.445
That's coming for you.

821
00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:46.965
Steadfastly remain in faith

822
00:45:51.275 --> 00:45:53.005
Because Here's one Peter five 10.

823
00:45:53.005 --> 00:45:56.325
After you've suffered a little while, maybe some

824
00:45:56.325 --> 00:45:57.525
of you feel like that's a long while

825
00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:02.845
after you've suffered a little while, the God of all grace

826
00:46:04.225 --> 00:46:07.325
who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ himself

827
00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:10.365
will restore, confirm, strengthen

828
00:46:10.545 --> 00:46:12.805
and establish you land there.

829
00:46:13.315 --> 00:46:18.005
Stay on that rock of him doing the work of him confirming,

830
00:46:18.685 --> 00:46:20.365
strengthening, establishing you,

831
00:46:20.705 --> 00:46:24.365
and restoring the joy of His salvation in you.

832
00:46:24.745 --> 00:46:25.845
Run to him for that today

833
00:46:29.705 --> 00:46:33.285
and sing this truth of living hope together.

834
00:46:33.865 --> 00:46:35.085
If you're able, let's stand

835
00:46:35.145 --> 00:46:39.445
and rejoice in that hope we have of Christ over all

836
00:46:39.785 --> 00:46:41.165
and in all.

837
00:46:41.775 --> 00:46:43.085
Let's sing for His glory.
