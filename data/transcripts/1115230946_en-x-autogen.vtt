00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:02.165
Amen.

2
00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:04.365
If you would be seated, we're gonna celebrate a baptism now

3
00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:11.285
Church.

4
00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:15.205
We get to continue to witness to God of just all

5
00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:17.805
that he has done and continue to praise him.

6
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:20.245
And that's what Joseph is here to do.

7
00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:23.125
Praise God for what he has done in his life,

8
00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:25.725
that he is a name above all.

9
00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.885
Names, friends. This is Joseph.

10
00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:30.645
He's a master student at UCO.

11
00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:33.845
Uh, and today he's gonna be baptized.

12
00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:37.165
Let me briefly just tell you a little bit of his story.

13
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.765
He moved here a few months ago, about a year ago.

14
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.245
Uh, but long

15
00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:44.885
before that, he grew up in a place called India

16
00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:45.965
with a few people there.

17
00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:51.125
Uh, and while he was there, uh, for until the age of five,

18
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.725
uh, Joseph went through a lot of things, uh,

19
00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:56.605
grew up in an Indian, Hindu, believing family.

20
00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:59.685
And until the age of five, he couldn't really talk.

21
00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:02.085
Um, and they didn't know what was going on,

22
00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:04.445
and they thought he couldn't talk for rest of his life.

23
00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:08.565
Um, but yet, uh, he had grandparents who had came to faith

24
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:10.405
and started praying for him.

25
00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.765
And then out of nowhere, just started talking.

26
00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:16.765
God answered, uh, their prayer, uh, who had,

27
00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:19.925
while still having parents who were following, uh, Hinduism.

28
00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:21.525
And not only that,

29
00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:25.845
after that he had even a longer path of just, uh, hardships.

30
00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.885
Uh, one of those things was, uh, education.

31
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:32.805
The village that he grew up in, um, wasn't, uh, resources.

32
00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:33.845
There pretty scars.

33
00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:36.565
And there were, there wasn't a lot of, uh, things.

34
00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:39.085
And so education was a hard thing to come by.

35
00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:41.325
And, uh, English was another thing

36
00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:44.045
that he just thought would not be possible for him to learn.

37
00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:48.925
Uh, but, uh, and just God's faithfulness in all of that.

38
00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:53.525
Uh, grandparents who were believers found a English Bible

39
00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:54.765
and gave him an English Bible

40
00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.365
and said, Hey, let this, let this be your teacher.

41
00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.765
Not only was it teacher for him to learn English,

42
00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:02.765
but yet to learn about Jesus

43
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:05.605
and what Jesus had done for him.

44
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.885
So he slowly started learning about what God, uh,

45
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:11.605
who God was and who Jesus was, uh,

46
00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:15.245
and through all of those things, yet still trying to, uh,

47
00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:16.405
survive in this village

48
00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:18.125
and make it, and all of those things.

49
00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.965
And then as, uh, that time went, uh,

50
00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:24.445
he graduated from, uh, high school

51
00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:27.805
and, uh, went to college, uh, had an incredible opportunity

52
00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:31.445
and then even played, uh, some professional badminton.

53
00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:33.485
Incredible. Uh, and so

54
00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:36.685
after that, he was wanting to pursue master's degree

55
00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:39.365
and, uh, apply to go, uh, to Europe.

56
00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:41.885
And he thought he had, uh, a chance to do that

57
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:43.005
and got rejected twice.

58
00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:45.005
And he was disappointed. I was like, man,

59
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.045
what did I do wrong?

60
00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:47.405
Why was I rejected?

61
00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:50.205
Uh, to go to Europe and had the scholarship

62
00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:51.365
lined up and all those things?

63
00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.085
And in God's goodness

64
00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.725
and sovereignty, he made a way for Joseph to come

65
00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:57.965
to the US about a year ago.

66
00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:01.365
And that's about when he encountered some

67
00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:03.005
of our college students, young adults,

68
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:07.405
international students who welcomed him with open arms, uh,

69
00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:10.845
and started sharing the gospel with him, not only

70
00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:12.965
by their words, but the by their works

71
00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:14.245
as well, by their deeds.

72
00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:15.765
And they loved him, cared for him,

73
00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:18.245
and he got to see on full display

74
00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:19.965
what the gospel was all about.

75
00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:23.685
And then around last December, had the opportunity

76
00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:25.205
to go to a cross gone.

77
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.525
And where he truly understood what had happened in his life,

78
00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.845
and understood that I must pick up my cross

79
00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:32.965
and follow him, deny himself,

80
00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:36.045
and follow him with all of his mind and being.

81
00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:38.485
And so, uh, it clicked in his head

82
00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:41.565
and it's like, man, I, I surrender everything that I have.

83
00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:45.965
And, um, after that, this Joseph started continued to meet

84
00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:49.325
with some of our students and, uh, learn about who Jesus was

85
00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:50.485
and how to follow him.

86
00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:53.165
And, uh, came to me few, uh, weeks ago

87
00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:55.485
and said, Shiva, I wanna be baptized.

88
00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:58.205
I wanna declare of what's happened.

89
00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:02.205
I wanna tell everyone that man, I, it's no longer I

90
00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:03.725
who live, I have died to myself.

91
00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:06.125
It's Christ who lives in me.

92
00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:09.525
And so, Joseph, you are here today, uh, showing

93
00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:13.245
the congregation here what's happened in your life

94
00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:15.925
and just what an incredible testimony of

95
00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:18.605
what God's done all the way from when you were young.

96
00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.085
So Joseph, it's my honor, brother.

97
00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:25.485
Then I get to baptize you in the name of the Father,

98
00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:26.925
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

99
00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:37.205
Praise God. Praise God.

100
00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:47.485
Well, amen. Isn't that, uh, just an.
