00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:12.625
If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things

2
00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.185
that are above where Christ is

3
00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:16.065
seated at the right hand of God,

4
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.385
Set your minds on things that are above,

5
00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:24.625
not on things that are on earth

6
00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:32.985
For you have died and your life is hidden

7
00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:34.745
with Christ in God.

8
00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:41.465
When Christ who is your life appears,

9
00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:43.665
then you will also appear with him in glory.

10
00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:22.385
Well, good morning again, church.

11
00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:23.985
Now I know what you're thinking,

12
00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:26.585
but no, I'm not officiating a wedding this afternoon.

13
00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:29.905
Uh, this is just something I started a few years ago

14
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:32.465
as a young pastor out in my first church in Weatherford,

15
00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:36.625
where uh, we spent 26 sermons through the book

16
00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.105
of Ephesians, right outta seminary.

17
00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:40.905
And that's just what we thought we needed to do.

18
00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:43.265
And so we all at the end of that, were really tired.

19
00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:45.945
And so I just said we need to honor that in some way

20
00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:48.625
and began this, this little tradition here

21
00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:50.105
and some of you picked up on it.

22
00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:51.985
Thank you for joining me in it.

23
00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:53.905
Uh, but we're excited

24
00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.745
because what it means for us today is

25
00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.465
that we're closing out this Christ above all series

26
00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:00.165
through the letter to the Colossians.

27
00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:02.445
It's been an amazing study, uh,

28
00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:04.645
through this fall and I've learned so much.

29
00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:07.365
I've been stretched a lot as a preacher through this book.

30
00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:10.445
It's been helpful. My prayer for us is

31
00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.485
that it has reawakened us to the glory

32
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.565
of our three in one God, our Lord

33
00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:19.805
and Savior, Jesus Christ, our very life,

34
00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:23.525
our worship, our joy that he is that,

35
00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:25.965
and that it changes us from the

36
00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:28.925
inside out as we come to the end.

37
00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:30.605
What we'll see in the bulk

38
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:33.565
of chapter four is a beautiful picture of

39
00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:36.925
what we saw back in Colossians one 18, this body

40
00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:39.045
of Christ, the church.

41
00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:42.845
We'll see what it looks like and some ways we can apply it.

42
00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:44.365
And so go ahead now and turn with me

43
00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:47.565
for the final time in this series to the end

44
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:49.845
of Colossians to chapter four.

45
00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:52.565
I'm gonna start in chapter four, verse seven.

46
00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:56.965
I'm gonna read the whole section first

47
00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:59.885
and we'll dive into what will appear on the surface, kind

48
00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:02.405
of a, a seemingly random list of names.

49
00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:05.885
Hard to preach these sections of scripture actually,

50
00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:07.405
but it's gonna show us a lot.

51
00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:11.765
Colossians four, seven through 18. Look at it with me.

52
00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:15.405
By the way, these names are hard for me to say too.

53
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:18.205
So just so few you can get there too.

54
00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:21.285
TCUs will tell you about all my activities.

55
00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:24.085
He's a beloved brother, a faithful minister

56
00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:25.565
and fellow servant in the Lord.

57
00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:29.645
I've sent him to you for this very purpose that you may know

58
00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.405
how we are, that he may encourage your hearts

59
00:04:33.225 --> 00:04:35.405
and with him, Onesimus, our faithful

60
00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:36.925
and beloved brother who's one of you.

61
00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:40.005
They will tell you of everything that's taken place here.

62
00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:43.605
Aris stares, my fellow prisoner greets you

63
00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:45.765
and mark the cousin of Barnabas

64
00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.765
concerning whom you've received instructions.

65
00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:49.165
If he comes to you, welcome him

66
00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:51.885
and Jesus who's called justice.

67
00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:55.245
These are the only men of the circumcision

68
00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:57.685
among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God.

69
00:04:58.345 --> 00:04:59.725
And they've been a comfort to me.

70
00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:02.885
Eris, who's one of you, a servant

71
00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:06.605
of Christ Jesus greets you always struggling on your behalf

72
00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:09.645
in his prayers that you may stand, mature

73
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:13.485
and fully assured in all the will of God for I ber him.

74
00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.245
Witness that he's worked hard for you

75
00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:16.525
and for those in La Deia

76
00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:21.005
and Opolis, Luke, the beloved physician greets you

77
00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:25.165
as does Demas give my greetings to the brothers at La Deia

78
00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.765
and to Nimah and the church in her house.

79
00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:30.165
And when this letter has been read

80
00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:33.165
among you have it also read in the church, the Laodiceans

81
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.125
and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea

82
00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:40.845
and say to Archus, see that you fulfill the ministry

83
00:05:40.845 --> 00:05:42.245
that you've received in the Lord.

84
00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:46.355
I Paul write this greeting with my own hand.

85
00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:50.915
Remember, my chains, grace, be with you

86
00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:55.835
Lord, thank you for this word.

87
00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:59.485
We know that this was a personal letter from the Apostle

88
00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:00.525
Paul to this church,

89
00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.285
and we're thankful that we get a glimpse into

90
00:06:03.285 --> 00:06:06.325
what you wanted him to say to them so that we could see it

91
00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:09.005
as your word for us today as well.

92
00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:12.765
Lord, it's seemingly random,

93
00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:16.005
but we know that you have a message for each of us today.

94
00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:18.365
So make us good soil.

95
00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:20.525
Give us good ears and eyes to hear

96
00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:23.565
and see what you want us to receive

97
00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:27.725
and bear good fruit through it, Lord, in Jesus' name.

98
00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:32.525
Amen. So the first thing we need to uh,

99
00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.085
notice here is the connection of the body.

100
00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:38.205
So I said, this is the body of Christ, the church.

101
00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:40.565
What does the connection look like here?

102
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:42.405
You'll see it very clearly.

103
00:06:43.815 --> 00:06:45.685
First, you'll see the connection in

104
00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:49.245
that church in in the church there in Colossae within the

105
00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:50.565
church in Colossae itself.

106
00:06:50.585 --> 00:06:53.045
What's the connection look like there?

107
00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:57.485
Well, remember this whole letter has showed this reality of

108
00:06:57.485 --> 00:06:59.405
who they were in Christ together,

109
00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:00.885
that there was a connection

110
00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:03.685
and how they were to behave and that connection.

111
00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:06.165
They were one body in Colossae.

112
00:07:06.165 --> 00:07:08.325
But even here in this section, you see Paul, he

113
00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:13.125
expected them to gather together, most likely in houses

114
00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:14.405
as house churches.

115
00:07:14.405 --> 00:07:15.485
Whether that was one

116
00:07:15.505 --> 00:07:18.405
or multiple, where these letters he was writing to them

117
00:07:18.425 --> 00:07:20.845
or to other churches could be read in that context.

118
00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.365
This was not a letter to an individual.

119
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.085
This was a letter to a group of people.

120
00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:26.405
This was to be read together.

121
00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:29.485
So they were connected within the church.

122
00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:33.085
They longed to be together.

123
00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:35.245
You go read acts, you read all of these letters,

124
00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:38.165
you see the longing to be together for them.

125
00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:40.685
It was not an afterthought to gather

126
00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:42.325
with other believers in worship.

127
00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:46.125
They were devoted to the fellowship.

128
00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:53.145
Are you just a simple question in light of that,

129
00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:55.065
the connection within the church, are you devoted

130
00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:56.545
to it like they were?

131
00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:02.025
But you also see further than that there's a connection

132
00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:06.225
of the body of Christ in the region that they're in.

133
00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:09.105
Not just the city of Colossae,

134
00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:12.305
but also in the region surrounding Colossae.

135
00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:15.185
We saw this map at the very beginning of the series

136
00:08:15.215 --> 00:08:17.025
that shows kind of where Colossae is

137
00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:20.425
and La Desia, these names of towns and cities around it.

138
00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:23.385
That's where he mentions La Desia in opis.

139
00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:26.225
Those are two nearby towns on the same trade route.

140
00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.385
So they would've been very closely connected to Colossae

141
00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:32.105
where this letter was written to.

142
00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:36.465
And, and most likely the believers in Colossae knew the

143
00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:39.265
believers in Opolis and Le Desia and,

144
00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:40.585
and in fact didn't just know them.

145
00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:44.965
They were so few of them. They needed each other, right?

146
00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:46.205
They were, they were brothers

147
00:08:46.205 --> 00:08:48.245
and sisters in Christ, even from cities

148
00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:51.125
where they were not nearby next door.

149
00:08:53.145 --> 00:08:54.245
And so here's the point of that.

150
00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:58.125
Those Christians in Colossae,

151
00:08:58.125 --> 00:09:01.925
they saw the Christians in Laodicea, in opis, not

152
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.085
as competition,

153
00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:08.205
but as necessary co-laborers in the gospel.

154
00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:12.845
Do we,

155
00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.355
it's a piercing question I think for all of us.

156
00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:24.235
Do we see other re churches in our region

157
00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:29.795
As teammates or as rivals in some way?

158
00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:36.935
Here's the reality this morning, probably

159
00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:38.615
'cause of the rain, it's a little bit higher than this, but,

160
00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:43.295
but in Edmond, there is at least 70,000

161
00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:44.615
people who are not going

162
00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:48.055
to church anywhere this morning just in Edmond.

163
00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:52.365
And, and so if that's the reality,

164
00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:58.365
if the Lord could use another church preaching the same

165
00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:01.365
gospel to reach those people that we never could,

166
00:10:01.555 --> 00:10:02.765
then praise God, right?

167
00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:05.845
What if somebody wanted to plant a church in the

168
00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:07.125
YMCA that's coming next door?

169
00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:09.525
We should celebrate that

170
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:11.965
because they're gonna reach people that we can't.

171
00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:17.125
Like this is regional body of Christ bigger than just us.

172
00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:18.445
It's not the kingdom of Henderson

173
00:10:18.445 --> 00:10:19.485
Hills, it's the kingdom of God.

174
00:10:20.585 --> 00:10:22.485
And so we should see the connection here

175
00:10:22.485 --> 00:10:23.565
and pray for other church.

176
00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:26.165
Let's stop posturing about church size and,

177
00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:28.805
and shuffling a few members here around like, there's plenty

178
00:10:28.805 --> 00:10:31.045
of people out there to fill every church.

179
00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:35.885
That could be what God uses Colossae and Leia

180
00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.765
and these others to reach those areas

181
00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:40.205
that they couldn't reach on their own.

182
00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:41.765
Same today.

183
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:46.385
What you also see in the passage though,

184
00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:48.545
is more than just the region, there's a connection

185
00:10:48.545 --> 00:10:52.425
to the body of Christ in the world, like

186
00:10:52.565 --> 00:10:53.625
around the world.

187
00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:56.305
Not just Colossae, not just the region, but globally.

188
00:10:56.615 --> 00:10:59.465
This goes out from where Paul's writing this

189
00:10:59.465 --> 00:11:00.865
to them in Colossae, most

190
00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:02.665
of the people Paul mentioned in this letter

191
00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:06.185
had never even been to Colossal.

192
00:11:06.185 --> 00:11:09.385
They were not in Colossae for sure had never even been yet.

193
00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:12.345
See the connection Paul makes here.

194
00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:17.385
You had TCUs, one of the couriers of this letter, someone

195
00:11:17.445 --> 00:11:19.185
who the Colossians didn't even know,

196
00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:21.625
but Paul said, here, he's gonna come encourage you.

197
00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:24.825
You had Aris Staris and Mark

198
00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:28.385
and Justice, three of these Jewish background believers

199
00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:31.145
that were with Paul as fellow workers,

200
00:11:31.645 --> 00:11:35.785
but he mentions them as examples of how people like

201
00:11:35.785 --> 00:11:37.665
that even in Colossae could stand fast.

202
00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:39.505
These are Jews following Jesus.

203
00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:42.665
Hey Jews in Colossal, you can too. Here's some examples.

204
00:11:44.925 --> 00:11:46.185
You had Epaphras.

205
00:11:47.145 --> 00:11:48.305
Remember Paul mentioned him back in

206
00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:49.345
chapter one, verse seven.

207
00:11:49.495 --> 00:11:52.385
He's the one who brought the gospel to Colossae

208
00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:55.045
and then he took the news back to Paul

209
00:11:55.345 --> 00:11:56.525
of what had happened there.

210
00:11:56.865 --> 00:11:58.405
So he's not in Colossae anymore,

211
00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:00.365
but he's a connection wherever he

212
00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:01.525
is in the world at this point.

213
00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:05.005
You had the well-known Luke

214
00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:07.365
and Demas who were living somewhere else, we don't know,

215
00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:09.965
but Paul identified them as caring

216
00:12:10.025 --> 00:12:12.045
for the church in Colossae.

217
00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.205
They'd never met him before, but, but they cared.

218
00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:19.365
And so why does Paul go through this list

219
00:12:19.385 --> 00:12:21.445
of mentioning all these people in different places?

220
00:12:24.555 --> 00:12:27.005
Well, the Colossian believers needed to know

221
00:12:27.005 --> 00:12:28.445
that they were not alone.

222
00:12:30.695 --> 00:12:31.895
I mean, you get in your little bubble

223
00:12:31.915 --> 00:12:33.255
and you think, I'm the only one.

224
00:12:33.745 --> 00:12:35.895
We're the only ones. We're in trouble here.

225
00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.935
So this is surely falling apart. No, they need to know.

226
00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:41.935
There were other believers out there standing with them

227
00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:45.725
That other people outside

228
00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:50.045
of Colossae believed the same things that in Colossae,

229
00:12:50.045 --> 00:12:51.565
they might've been getting mocked for.

230
00:12:53.275 --> 00:12:54.645
They said no, actually,

231
00:12:54.645 --> 00:12:56.005
there's other people believe this too.

232
00:12:56.345 --> 00:12:57.725
We can stand firm.

233
00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:01.805
I mean, just think about how encouraging it is

234
00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:04.965
to you when you hear of God's work and somebody else's life.

235
00:13:06.555 --> 00:13:09.525
Like we're gonna hear at the end of, of the service today,

236
00:13:09.565 --> 00:13:11.885
a baptism testimony of, of that that's meant

237
00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:15.525
to encourage you for how God's worked in his life.

238
00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:18.525
We hear it from other people around the world.

239
00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:19.685
It spurs you on.

240
00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:22.765
But listen, you can do the same thing for people elsewhere.

241
00:13:23.905 --> 00:13:27.685
You can encourage them by your connection

242
00:13:27.685 --> 00:13:30.685
and your response and your letters and your prayers.

243
00:13:32.475 --> 00:13:34.645
It's like what Hebrews 13, three says.

244
00:13:35.245 --> 00:13:36.725
Remember those who are in prison.

245
00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:38.725
That word, remember is not just think about,

246
00:13:38.795 --> 00:13:41.965
it's actually identify with those who are in prison

247
00:13:42.305 --> 00:13:44.245
as though in prison with them

248
00:13:44.745 --> 00:13:48.685
and those who are mistreated since you also

249
00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:49.925
are in the body.

250
00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:55.405
It's the global body of Christ. We're all in this together.

251
00:13:55.825 --> 00:13:59.285
We can encourage others and be connected with them.

252
00:13:59.285 --> 00:14:01.565
And so that's the nature of the body of Christ.

253
00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:06.285
There's a connection here inside and regionally and globally

254
00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:10.445
and eternally that we can have as his body.

255
00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:15.895
We see that here. Yet Paul was not just doing a roll call,

256
00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:20.385
he was also commending the way the body

257
00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:24.105
of Christ should serve in ministry to one another.

258
00:14:25.355 --> 00:14:26.905
Right? So he's listing these names.

259
00:14:27.205 --> 00:14:28.345
Here's some encouragement,

260
00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:31.665
but also he, let's give some examples of what it means

261
00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:36.425
to be the body and serve in ministry to one another.

262
00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:39.195
We see it here now.

263
00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:41.315
You read through the New Testament about 50 times,

264
00:14:41.855 --> 00:14:44.995
you see this phrase one another show up.

265
00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:49.675
And what that means is those are commands given

266
00:14:49.895 --> 00:14:54.325
to the church, to the body of Christ, things

267
00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:56.045
that we ought to imitate today

268
00:14:56.045 --> 00:14:57.725
and how we are to treat one another

269
00:14:57.745 --> 00:15:00.485
and how we are to be together in this body,

270
00:15:01.105 --> 00:15:03.285
the one anothers, we call them how you are

271
00:15:03.285 --> 00:15:05.005
to treat one another.

272
00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:06.565
That means there's a lot more than

273
00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:07.805
what I'm about to say here.

274
00:15:07.805 --> 00:15:10.245
There's 40 plus more,

275
00:15:10.245 --> 00:15:13.725
but I've identified seven here in just this passage alone,

276
00:15:15.225 --> 00:15:18.085
how the body of Christ ministers first

277
00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:20.285
in serving one another.

278
00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:24.845
We should serve one another in the body of Christ.

279
00:15:25.945 --> 00:15:29.445
You see it in verse seven, Paul identified TCUs

280
00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:32.365
as a fellow servant in the Lord.

281
00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:35.605
That word servant means someone who does whatever they can

282
00:15:35.605 --> 00:15:39.725
to make someone feel loved, cared for, helped serving.

283
00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:44.205
Paul gave the example of local boy e Apris.

284
00:15:44.505 --> 00:15:47.005
He worked hard for you.

285
00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:52.045
That's serving archus was to fulfill his ministry.

286
00:15:52.045 --> 00:15:54.725
That's really just a call to serve whatever ministry it was.

287
00:15:56.745 --> 00:15:59.165
But, but I want you to read back through that in your mind.

288
00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:01.245
All the things we saw in this,

289
00:16:01.265 --> 00:16:02.685
the listing and what they were doing.

290
00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:06.925
Notice nowhere in this section do you see

291
00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:08.725
consumer Christianity.

292
00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:16.415
Everyone here in Colossae Le Desia, uh, around the world,

293
00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.295
they were focused on giving.

294
00:16:18.605 --> 00:16:20.295
They were focused on counting others

295
00:16:20.395 --> 00:16:22.655
as more significant than themselves to

296
00:16:22.655 --> 00:16:24.935
where they could serve each other.

297
00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:30.525
Listen, if you walk in here every week thinking

298
00:16:31.075 --> 00:16:35.525
what you can get out of this, it's the wrong mentality.

299
00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:40.765
You should come into gatherings like this, looking

300
00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:43.325
for ways you can serve others.

301
00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:47.245
That's when you'll actually receive the benefit out of this.

302
00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:51.525
But, but the focus should be how can I serve the Lord?

303
00:16:51.785 --> 00:16:55.485
How can I serve others in how I come into the gathering

304
00:16:55.585 --> 00:16:56.765
as the body of Christ?

305
00:16:57.705 --> 00:17:01.325
That's the picture we get here of serving one another.

306
00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:07.645
Here's the second one, encouraging one another.

307
00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:12.245
The second one, another here is encouraging.

308
00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:16.885
Now, the same thing Paul wrote back in Colossians two, two,

309
00:17:17.205 --> 00:17:19.365
encouragement was part of what he was working for them

310
00:17:19.425 --> 00:17:21.565
to have because they were discouraged.

311
00:17:21.985 --> 00:17:23.885
He wanted them to be encouraged.

312
00:17:23.885 --> 00:17:25.245
And so he sent TCUs

313
00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:29.125
and animus to help with that encouragement.

314
00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:32.725
But we've gotta ask the question, what is encouragement?

315
00:17:33.515 --> 00:17:36.365
Because we can get a wrong picture in our day

316
00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:39.045
where it's like you just think better about things.

317
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:41.445
Like you better just change your mind, right?

318
00:17:41.445 --> 00:17:43.725
That's encouraging. Well, actually,

319
00:17:43.725 --> 00:17:47.405
the word here in the original language is the same root word

320
00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:51.405
used back in John 14 to describe the Holy Spirit.

321
00:17:53.425 --> 00:17:55.685
And it says it in a way that he's the helper,

322
00:17:56.155 --> 00:17:57.405
he's the comforter.

323
00:17:59.575 --> 00:18:01.555
And that's the same idea here,

324
00:18:01.555 --> 00:18:03.675
because that's what the Colossians needed, right?

325
00:18:04.385 --> 00:18:07.985
They needed help. They needed comfort.

326
00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:10.345
They didn't just need to change their mind.

327
00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:11.505
They needed help.

328
00:18:12.085 --> 00:18:13.705
And so Paul sent these guys

329
00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:16.985
to comfort them in their affliction,

330
00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:18.465
to help them stand fast.

331
00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:20.305
These worldly philosophies were

332
00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:21.505
coming at them left and right.

333
00:18:21.735 --> 00:18:23.105
They were discouraged

334
00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:24.305
because they felt like it wasn't

335
00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:26.265
working, whatever they were believing.

336
00:18:27.955 --> 00:18:31.255
And so Paul said here, these guys are going to encourage,

337
00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:36.175
going to give you courage to stand in a really dark place.

338
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.315
That's what we need to do for one another as well.

339
00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:46.115
Encourage one another.

340
00:18:46.115 --> 00:18:47.315
Give courage to,

341
00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:50.475
whenever we're discouraged, we need encouragement.

342
00:18:51.785 --> 00:18:55.035
It's not patronizing, it's not generic and niceties.

343
00:18:55.815 --> 00:18:57.075
Hey, you're doing okay, right?

344
00:18:57.075 --> 00:18:58.475
That's not what we're talking about.

345
00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:03.715
We're talking about reminding one another of who God is.

346
00:19:05.925 --> 00:19:09.385
That's what Paul sent these guys to do in Colossae.

347
00:19:09.445 --> 00:19:11.825
Say, Hey, remember who God is. Remember who Christ is.

348
00:19:11.965 --> 00:19:13.865
I'm gonna write a letter that tells all about

349
00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:14.985
Christ above all.

350
00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:17.865
Here he is. Here he is. Remind them. Remind them.

351
00:19:17.885 --> 00:19:21.705
Hey, Colossians, listen. He's God, you can trust him.

352
00:19:22.285 --> 00:19:23.265
You can give your life to him.

353
00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:27.855
Encouragement in that.

354
00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:31.055
So we need to do for each other.

355
00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:32.575
When you're down, you need somebody

356
00:19:32.575 --> 00:19:33.855
to sit across the table from you

357
00:19:33.915 --> 00:19:37.095
and encourage you in who God is.

358
00:19:40.205 --> 00:19:41.975
Next, we see forgiving one another here.

359
00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.215
That's the next one, forgiving one another.

360
00:19:46.315 --> 00:19:48.855
Now, where is that in this section?

361
00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:54.455
Well, there's a couple places I believe based on the back

362
00:19:54.455 --> 00:19:56.695
stories that you might not be aware of here.

363
00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:01.325
In fact, you can read it over in Philemon.

364
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:05.965
There's a really short one page letter called Philemon. It.

365
00:20:05.965 --> 00:20:08.325
It actually talks about this very public tension

366
00:20:08.475 --> 00:20:09.525
that Philemon

367
00:20:09.545 --> 00:20:14.365
and Onesimus here had A public,

368
00:20:15.745 --> 00:20:18.205
uh, issue and problem that they had to deal with.

369
00:20:18.465 --> 00:20:21.445
Yet at this point,

370
00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:25.245
Paul's writing Colossians later it had clearly been resolved

371
00:20:25.245 --> 00:20:28.205
because Onesimus was called faithful

372
00:20:28.305 --> 00:20:32.005
and beloved here, he was free where he once was a slave.

373
00:20:32.005 --> 00:20:34.485
He's free to travel and do the things here.

374
00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:37.685
And Paul was sending him back to the place it happened.

375
00:20:40.025 --> 00:20:42.445
So whatever was going on was resolved.

376
00:20:44.475 --> 00:20:46.045
That only comes through forgiveness,

377
00:20:47.835 --> 00:20:51.325
that it all had been washed away, that they had,

378
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:53.005
they had reconciled.

379
00:20:55.315 --> 00:20:57.405
There's not only that one, there's also in verse 10,

380
00:20:57.435 --> 00:21:02.085
Paul mentioned Mark, which is the same John Mark

381
00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:06.085
that Paul and Barnabas separated over in Acts 15.

382
00:21:08.595 --> 00:21:10.365
Back in Acts 15, Paul

383
00:21:10.365 --> 00:21:13.005
and Barnabas disagreed over John Mark's

384
00:21:13.155 --> 00:21:14.765
perceived spiritual maturity.

385
00:21:16.225 --> 00:21:17.445
He said, I wanna take him with us.

386
00:21:17.445 --> 00:21:18.925
And he said, no, I don't wanna take him.

387
00:21:18.925 --> 00:21:21.885
And, and so they actually ended up splitting, separating

388
00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:24.485
and going into two different directions from ministry.

389
00:21:26.065 --> 00:21:27.605
But, but they had separated

390
00:21:27.605 --> 00:21:31.285
because of this John Mark, probably in a pretty painful way.

391
00:21:31.285 --> 00:21:35.805
There was a separation there. But look at what happened.

392
00:21:36.975 --> 00:21:38.585
Look, look at what had happened. By now.

393
00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:43.425
Paul now saw Mark as useful to his ministry.

394
00:21:44.735 --> 00:21:46.865
They were back in relationship again.

395
00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:49.945
In fact, a really close one at that where Mark's one

396
00:21:49.945 --> 00:21:52.025
of the three of the former Jews

397
00:21:52.205 --> 00:21:54.225
who actually stayed with Paul.

398
00:21:55.765 --> 00:21:58.995
There was a reconciliation there was for forgiveness.

399
00:22:02.575 --> 00:22:04.715
Now, God can use separations like that

400
00:22:04.775 --> 00:22:07.155
to further his ministry, which he did in that case.

401
00:22:07.355 --> 00:22:10.075
I mean, two separate ministries instead of just one.

402
00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:13.755
Yes, but forgiveness

403
00:22:14.405 --> 00:22:16.875
means reconciliation.

404
00:22:17.015 --> 00:22:18.555
It means glory to God.

405
00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:22.515
It it, it shows us that unforgiveness

406
00:22:23.585 --> 00:22:24.795
only hurts yourself.

407
00:22:26.975 --> 00:22:29.795
It doesn't hurt the other person as much as it hurts you.

408
00:22:30.095 --> 00:22:32.435
And that's not what God calls us to do.

409
00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:36.235
He says, forgive one another as I have forgiven you.

410
00:22:40.385 --> 00:22:44.745
Here's the next one. We see the ministry here of

411
00:22:45.355 --> 00:22:46.705
comforting one another,

412
00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:51.465
comforting one another is here.

413
00:22:51.615 --> 00:22:54.185
It's verse 11, the very end of 11.

414
00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:57.425
You see that they have been a comfort to me.

415
00:22:57.535 --> 00:23:01.905
Paul says, the idea of that word is

416
00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:03.945
that you hurt with someone who hurts.

417
00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:08.905
That's comforting hurt with someone who hurts.

418
00:23:09.015 --> 00:23:11.865
It's consoling someone in their grief, an arm around them,

419
00:23:11.865 --> 00:23:14.985
maybe not even saying anything to comfort them.

420
00:23:15.335 --> 00:23:17.705
It's just your presence with them.

421
00:23:17.975 --> 00:23:20.745
Paul had been abandoned by nearly

422
00:23:21.465 --> 00:23:23.585
everyone else at this point in his life,

423
00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:25.345
but not these three men.

424
00:23:27.495 --> 00:23:30.985
They had been with him, cared for him, loved him.

425
00:23:31.055 --> 00:23:33.585
That was a comfort to his soul.

426
00:23:33.935 --> 00:23:37.065
That is part of the ministry of the body of Christ.

427
00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:43.765
You should be able to be certain if you are a believer in

428
00:23:43.815 --> 00:23:46.845
faith of his life, death and resurrection for you.

429
00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:49.485
If you are a member of the body of Christ,

430
00:23:49.545 --> 00:23:53.365
you should be certain that you are never alone.

431
00:23:56.985 --> 00:23:59.265
'cause one Corinthians 12 says, the members of the body are

432
00:23:59.265 --> 00:24:01.465
to have the same care for one another.

433
00:24:03.225 --> 00:24:06.165
And if one member suffers, all suffer together.

434
00:24:10.625 --> 00:24:13.805
See, we're not just a pile of disconnected body parts.

435
00:24:15.865 --> 00:24:19.685
We are the body of Christ connected, which means we are

436
00:24:19.685 --> 00:24:21.565
to get involved in each other's lives.

437
00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:25.485
Even when it hurts, even when it's hard, we are supposed

438
00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:28.645
to comfort one another

439
00:24:30.165 --> 00:24:34.105
and give comfort and receive comfort as we're known.

440
00:24:34.205 --> 00:24:35.265
You need to be known here.

441
00:24:36.485 --> 00:24:38.465
You can't be known if you're just attending.

442
00:24:38.465 --> 00:24:40.465
You've gotta be known by involvement.

443
00:24:43.965 --> 00:24:47.565
Here's another ministry of the body we see here praying

444
00:24:47.825 --> 00:24:51.565
for one another, praying for one another.

445
00:24:54.145 --> 00:24:55.245
Paul's already prayed a lot

446
00:24:55.345 --> 00:24:57.365
for the Colossians throughout this whole letter,

447
00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:01.885
but look again at verse 12, not just Paul verse 12,

448
00:25:04.075 --> 00:25:08.325
Eris, whose one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus greets you

449
00:25:09.385 --> 00:25:12.405
always struggling on your behalf in his prayers

450
00:25:12.995 --> 00:25:14.405
that you may stand, mature

451
00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:17.285
and fully assured in all the will of God.

452
00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:22.255
Eris had a deep connection.

453
00:25:22.395 --> 00:25:24.775
So much so that he agonized in prayer

454
00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:26.975
for their spiritual growth.

455
00:25:29.115 --> 00:25:31.085
Like how much of a ministry that is, right?

456
00:25:33.475 --> 00:25:35.165
Like we need God to do the work

457
00:25:35.165 --> 00:25:37.205
and so we need to pray that he would do the work, right?

458
00:25:37.205 --> 00:25:40.245
That's not just a generic like, Hey, we're gonna pray.

459
00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:41.965
Uh, just spend some time in prayer.

460
00:25:42.015 --> 00:25:43.125
We're going to go to battle.

461
00:25:43.135 --> 00:25:46.525
We're gonna ask God to work in us and through us

462
00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:49.405
and assure us of his plan for us.

463
00:25:49.405 --> 00:25:51.725
Because that's one thing the Colossians need to be reminded

464
00:25:51.745 --> 00:25:54.285
of, was that it was God's will for them to be saved.

465
00:25:55.555 --> 00:25:57.035
'cause remember, they're, they're struck

466
00:25:57.035 --> 00:25:59.355
by all these other philosophies out there.

467
00:25:59.695 --> 00:26:02.115
And for them to be in this religious melting pot

468
00:26:02.175 --> 00:26:05.955
of colossae, they need to remember that it was God's will

469
00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:09.955
for them to be saved should give 'em confidence.

470
00:26:12.485 --> 00:26:15.775
Same for us. As it gets a little bit harder to declare

471
00:26:15.955 --> 00:26:18.855
to others that you are a follower of Christ, we need

472
00:26:18.855 --> 00:26:23.055
to be reminded and pray for one another, to stand fast

473
00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:28.435
in our faith, fully assured in the will

474
00:26:28.435 --> 00:26:30.835
of God that he called you to salvation.

475
00:26:30.895 --> 00:26:32.835
He saved you. He guaranteed your salvation.

476
00:26:33.255 --> 00:26:36.995
Man, we need to be praying that each one of us can do that

477
00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.315
praying for one another.

478
00:26:41.335 --> 00:26:43.725
The next ministry may be a little more hidden here,

479
00:26:43.825 --> 00:26:47.525
but it's just as critical imitate the ministry of

480
00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:49.965
welcoming one another.

481
00:26:52.795 --> 00:26:56.245
Praying for, but also welcoming one another.

482
00:26:57.755 --> 00:26:59.325
Welcome Mark. Verse 10.

483
00:26:59.345 --> 00:27:02.845
He says, yes, but, but this is also in verse 15.

484
00:27:03.075 --> 00:27:07.085
Paul greets MFA and the church in her house.

485
00:27:08.865 --> 00:27:10.045
Now, we don't know much about her.

486
00:27:11.435 --> 00:27:14.685
Most likely she's a, a single wealthy business woman

487
00:27:15.665 --> 00:27:18.685
who was meeting Paul at some point along the way

488
00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:22.885
as she traveled around the region sharing her goods

489
00:27:22.885 --> 00:27:25.525
and services, whatever she had as a business or,

490
00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:28.845
or maybe she was just traveling to purchase more goods.

491
00:27:28.845 --> 00:27:31.045
We don't know. But she met Paul at some point,

492
00:27:31.295 --> 00:27:33.005
heard the gospel, believed it,

493
00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:37.285
and she comes back to Colossae or tole de the region

494
00:27:37.825 --> 00:27:39.405
and notice how she served

495
00:27:41.405 --> 00:27:43.305
by hosting a church in her house.

496
00:27:45.335 --> 00:27:47.275
We don't know exactly what this looked like, but,

497
00:27:47.695 --> 00:27:49.475
but she simply offered what she had.

498
00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:53.795
Most likely it was a big house, lots

499
00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:55.075
and lots of, okay, I'm not gonna go there again.

500
00:27:55.075 --> 00:27:59.715
Right? Uh, but she made it a place

501
00:28:00.105 --> 00:28:02.955
that was welcoming for the church to meet.

502
00:28:05.165 --> 00:28:06.825
She just said, here's my house. We can use it

503
00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:08.225
to meet in because it's big enough.

504
00:28:08.225 --> 00:28:09.505
That's what I hope. You see a lot

505
00:28:09.645 --> 00:28:12.345
of people here in this, this passage.

506
00:28:12.795 --> 00:28:13.985
We're just regular people.

507
00:28:15.615 --> 00:28:17.945
Like we don't know anything about them. They're not famous.

508
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:20.665
Then you think about the people. He doesn't even mention all

509
00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.465
over colossal Leo Decia elsewhere,

510
00:28:22.695 --> 00:28:26.505
that they are just average Joe, average Jane, kind of people

511
00:28:27.725 --> 00:28:31.785
who had been saved by the gospel, believed in Jesus,

512
00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:33.825
and they were collected together

513
00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:36.425
as this regular group of people.

514
00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.385
Most of them not playing public roles at all.

515
00:28:39.615 --> 00:28:41.345
They don't even get mentioned anywhere,

516
00:28:41.645 --> 00:28:43.345
but everyone had a part to play.

517
00:28:46.205 --> 00:28:49.535
They were all to serve with what they'd been given,

518
00:28:53.235 --> 00:28:57.215
and that's at least in welcoming one another's.

519
00:28:57.215 --> 00:29:00.415
Romans 15 very explicitly says, welcome one another

520
00:29:00.435 --> 00:29:01.695
as Christ has welcomed you.

521
00:29:01.835 --> 00:29:05.095
So listen, you might never get able to come up here

522
00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:10.215
and teach or to lead music or to do anything that's public

523
00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:11.575
or, or give a lot of money,

524
00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:13.935
and you might not be able to do any of those things,

525
00:29:14.075 --> 00:29:15.695
but you can serve right?

526
00:29:17.685 --> 00:29:21.905
You can find a way to fit. You can welcome one another.

527
00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:24.865
You can be a welcoming face as somebody walks in

528
00:29:24.865 --> 00:29:27.465
that you're not looking like you're disappointed to come

529
00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:29.665
to church today, but you're actually excited to be here.

530
00:29:31.405 --> 00:29:34.745
You can see the joy of the Lord is my strength showing

531
00:29:34.745 --> 00:29:37.465
through your face, even through hard seasons.

532
00:29:37.465 --> 00:29:38.625
That's a welcoming face.

533
00:29:38.725 --> 00:29:41.805
You can show mercy to someone who's sitting alone.

534
00:29:41.945 --> 00:29:44.165
You can hold babies, you can stack chairs.

535
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:48.125
You can welcome people by hosting them at your house.

536
00:29:48.345 --> 00:29:51.325
You can rake leaves for like on and on.

537
00:29:51.425 --> 00:29:53.405
You can go through all of life

538
00:29:53.585 --> 00:29:55.645
and say, how can I make people feel

539
00:29:55.855 --> 00:29:58.765
loved And cared for?

540
00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:01.905
That's the true spirit of welcoming.

541
00:30:01.905 --> 00:30:04.065
It's not about whether you have folded napkins and

542
00:30:04.285 --> 00:30:07.105
and fitted sheets that are ironed on your beds at home.

543
00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:08.705
Like that's not anything about welcoming.

544
00:30:09.695 --> 00:30:10.865
It's about your spirit.

545
00:30:12.785 --> 00:30:16.325
Do people look at you in the city?

546
00:30:16.425 --> 00:30:17.885
Do they meet you in your neighborhood?

547
00:30:17.945 --> 00:30:19.405
Do they walk in this building

548
00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:22.045
and do they say, man, this,

549
00:30:22.275 --> 00:30:24.885
this feels like it would feel if Jesus was here.

550
00:30:27.955 --> 00:30:29.605
Shouldn't that be the way it is?

551
00:30:32.915 --> 00:30:35.045
Like if Jesus was literally sitting here with us,

552
00:30:35.425 --> 00:30:38.005
how would it feel if he was planning events,

553
00:30:38.145 --> 00:30:39.685
if he was talking with people?

554
00:30:39.865 --> 00:30:42.645
How would it feel? That's the way we should be. Church.

555
00:30:45.045 --> 00:30:48.745
That's being welcoming. That's all of you can do that.

556
00:30:48.745 --> 00:30:51.385
Whether you can preach or lead music or not.

557
00:30:51.695 --> 00:30:56.165
That can be you. Here's the last one.

558
00:30:57.505 --> 00:30:59.885
The final ministry of the body we see mentioned here is in

559
00:30:59.885 --> 00:31:02.005
verse 17 regarding this archus.

560
00:31:03.665 --> 00:31:06.405
The way I'm phrasing this one is calling one another,

561
00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:10.525
calling one another

562
00:31:12.965 --> 00:31:17.835
because looking at it, verse 17, say to Archus, see

563
00:31:17.835 --> 00:31:19.875
that you fulfill the ministry

564
00:31:19.905 --> 00:31:22.475
that you've received in the Lord.

565
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:26.685
Now, again, we don't know exactly what this ministry was,

566
00:31:26.745 --> 00:31:30.885
but he needed to be reminded that God had called him

567
00:31:31.225 --> 00:31:32.285
to whatever it was,

568
00:31:34.455 --> 00:31:37.475
And Paul used an an interesting say to archivist,

569
00:31:37.475 --> 00:31:39.795
that's a plural form of say so.

570
00:31:39.795 --> 00:31:43.995
He said, Hey, church, call archivist to the ministry

571
00:31:43.995 --> 00:31:48.115
that he knows he has remind him church

572
00:31:48.465 --> 00:31:50.595
that he's got this ministry.

573
00:31:54.775 --> 00:31:55.915
We do that here, don't we?

574
00:31:59.675 --> 00:32:02.975
Nearly weekly, someone right here stands up

575
00:32:02.975 --> 00:32:05.775
and calls you to fulfill the whatever ministry God's given

576
00:32:05.775 --> 00:32:08.895
you, whatever it is, right?

577
00:32:08.895 --> 00:32:11.655
Something unique based on your personality, your story,

578
00:32:11.655 --> 00:32:13.415
your passions, especially your

579
00:32:13.455 --> 00:32:14.855
giftings from the Holy Spirit.

580
00:32:15.315 --> 00:32:17.095
You are called to do it,

581
00:32:18.315 --> 00:32:21.935
and we're reminding you serve, find your place.

582
00:32:22.515 --> 00:32:23.815
Use what you've been given

583
00:32:24.115 --> 00:32:27.015
to fulfill the ministry God has called you to.

584
00:32:30.755 --> 00:32:33.135
But archivist was a leader we think in the church,

585
00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:40.125
and so there's also a distinct call from the Lord to

586
00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.085
vocational church roles

587
00:32:42.315 --> 00:32:46.835
that some people within the church do receive, whether

588
00:32:46.835 --> 00:32:50.915
that's to be a pastor or to minister on staff in some way,

589
00:32:50.915 --> 00:32:52.875
or to move overseas as a missionary.

590
00:32:52.975 --> 00:32:57.675
We believe that God calls some to a life

591
00:32:57.975 --> 00:33:02.595
of service, and I believe

592
00:33:02.705 --> 00:33:04.875
he's calling some of you to those tasks.

593
00:33:08.955 --> 00:33:10.985
Again, we're all called to ministry.

594
00:33:11.165 --> 00:33:15.595
Yes, we are, but some

595
00:33:15.595 --> 00:33:18.795
of us are called to make our living by the gospel.

596
00:33:21.495 --> 00:33:23.955
Not all, but some and,

597
00:33:23.955 --> 00:33:28.235
and listen, as I tra trace trends and read blogs

598
00:33:28.235 --> 00:33:29.995
and articles and talk to other pastors,

599
00:33:29.995 --> 00:33:34.555
there is a crisis coming where we will not have enough

600
00:33:36.735 --> 00:33:39.615
vocational ministers to fill the needs in all the churches.

601
00:33:42.505 --> 00:33:46.395
There's not enough pastors coming up, not enough ministers

602
00:33:46.395 --> 00:33:47.435
to fill all these roles

603
00:33:47.465 --> 00:33:49.355
that we have in churches around the country.

604
00:33:51.345 --> 00:33:52.875
There's needs all around the world

605
00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:55.195
where we don't have enough people called to go overseas

606
00:33:55.255 --> 00:33:57.275
or feeling like they should go overseas

607
00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.515
and plant their lives somewhere else.

608
00:33:58.535 --> 00:34:00.275
We just don't have enough. There's a crisis coming.

609
00:34:00.285 --> 00:34:05.215
We're not gonna have enough, and I,

610
00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:06.375
I get why it's hard.

611
00:34:07.355 --> 00:34:09.935
The enemy fights hard. You don't get paid very much.

612
00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:12.015
You, you, people can hurt you.

613
00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:14.215
Like I get why people don't do it,

614
00:34:14.275 --> 00:34:18.295
but we desperately need people called into vocational

615
00:34:18.295 --> 00:34:19.575
service for the church.

616
00:34:22.865 --> 00:34:25.035
It's one reason we're kicking off a,

617
00:34:25.155 --> 00:34:27.075
a new residency program very soon

618
00:34:27.075 --> 00:34:29.275
so we can train up more leaders

619
00:34:29.495 --> 00:34:30.995
for the church in the future.

620
00:34:32.825 --> 00:34:37.655
Maybe he's calling you to give your life

621
00:34:37.715 --> 00:34:41.855
and make your living by this gospel message, even

622
00:34:41.875 --> 00:34:44.335
as we are all called to serve.

623
00:34:47.435 --> 00:34:50.215
But listen, it, it doesn't matter how good that program is,

624
00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.615
a best residency program.

625
00:34:52.795 --> 00:34:55.495
Mark's doing a great job, but, but he could be the best or

626
00:34:55.715 --> 00:34:58.695
or even how high our percentage of serving is

627
00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:00.055
and we get a hundred percent of people

628
00:35:00.055 --> 00:35:02.535
who attend serve in some way in the church, right?

629
00:35:02.635 --> 00:35:04.695
We could have all of that. It can be the best program.

630
00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:07.455
It doesn't matter if we are not

631
00:35:08.245 --> 00:35:12.455
resting in the power God gives the body

632
00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:19.735
structure, systems, process, whatever, doesn't matter

633
00:35:21.235 --> 00:35:24.895
if we're not resting in the power that God gives the body.

634
00:35:27.215 --> 00:35:30.255
I mean, all this ministry action I've shown here

635
00:35:31.715 --> 00:35:35.055
and really, really the ability to live out the whole

636
00:35:35.755 --> 00:35:39.205
new self kind of life we've seen throughout in Colossians,

637
00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:44.845
like the ability to stand fast against any worldly

638
00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:47.205
philosophy coming your way, the ability

639
00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:50.565
to grow in our worship of Christ.

640
00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:54.005
It all comes from the very last few words

641
00:35:54.145 --> 00:35:55.365
of Colossians, right?

642
00:35:56.355 --> 00:35:59.165
Look at the end of of verse 18, chapter four,

643
00:35:59.385 --> 00:36:04.365
the last four words he writes, grace, be with you,

644
00:36:04.875 --> 00:36:05.875
Amen.

645
00:36:07.775 --> 00:36:11.895
Whose grace, God's grace, right?

646
00:36:11.915 --> 00:36:16.855
So to everything he'd written until this point,

647
00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:19.575
everything he believed, everything

648
00:36:19.765 --> 00:36:22.135
that would empower the Colossians

649
00:36:22.475 --> 00:36:24.295
to live out everything he's just said

650
00:36:24.435 --> 00:36:29.135
for over four chapters, it was summed up in one word, grace,

651
00:36:31.625 --> 00:36:34.095
God's grace, the grace from the Father.

652
00:36:34.115 --> 00:36:35.695
We saw in chapter one verse two,

653
00:36:36.155 --> 00:36:37.855
all the way at the beginning, the grace

654
00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:40.935
of the gospel throughout the whole letter, grace,

655
00:36:41.485 --> 00:36:43.295
that is our power source.

656
00:36:46.295 --> 00:36:48.795
All this that he said, all this that we're doing,

657
00:36:48.985 --> 00:36:51.395
it's worthless apart from the Lord.

658
00:36:51.665 --> 00:36:54.595
It's merely religious behavior modification

659
00:36:54.815 --> 00:36:56.275
and it does nothing for you

660
00:36:56.495 --> 00:36:58.355
and it does nothing for anyone else.

661
00:37:00.575 --> 00:37:04.315
Church. We must not be that kind of people.

662
00:37:07.215 --> 00:37:10.035
We have to see Christ as above all.

663
00:37:11.335 --> 00:37:15.515
We have to see that as we give our very lives to him,

664
00:37:15.745 --> 00:37:19.835
that he will fill us with his spirit, he will make us new.

665
00:37:19.975 --> 00:37:22.275
He will totally transform everything

666
00:37:22.305 --> 00:37:23.995
because he is our source.

667
00:37:24.415 --> 00:37:28.435
He is our very life, and so we open our hands

668
00:37:28.975 --> 00:37:32.475
and we allow him to change us into everything we've seen

669
00:37:32.475 --> 00:37:34.715
here throughout the last few weeks in Colossians.

670
00:37:37.095 --> 00:37:38.435
You can't look at this and say,

671
00:37:38.435 --> 00:37:39.715
all right, I'm gonna do this myself.

672
00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:42.035
I'm gonna make this happen myself. It is.

673
00:37:42.105 --> 00:37:43.115
It's gonna fall flat,

674
00:37:45.735 --> 00:37:47.995
But grace be with you.

675
00:37:48.865 --> 00:37:51.795
That is what God promises

676
00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:54.515
to give you the power to do it.

677
00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:59.805
Grace His

678
00:37:59.855 --> 00:38:02.685
grace and listen.

679
00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:06.325
He's worthy of that. He's worthy of you saying all of life.

680
00:38:06.505 --> 00:38:11.105
God is yours and he will

681
00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:15.585
Empower you To do all that he's said to do here.

682
00:38:17.535 --> 00:38:19.285
Grace, be with you.
