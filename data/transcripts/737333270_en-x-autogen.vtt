WEBVTT

1
00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:11.115
Well, good morning church.

2
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:12.395
It is the end of a series.

3
00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:14.355
And so, uh, this, this was something

4
00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:18.195
that I started back when I first began preaching about 12

5
00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:19.675
years ago at our first church.

6
00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:22.235
I went through the book of Ephesians in 26 sermons.

7
00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:23.515
And so I felt like I needed to honor

8
00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:24.955
that at the end of the sermon series.

9
00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:26.355
And so just began dressing up

10
00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:29.595
and it's a fun thing that four of you have participated in

11
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:31.235
so far and so excited for that.

12
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:35.795
Thanks for that. Uh, yeah, so anyway,

13
00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:37.435
we're gonna keep doing it for the next 30

14
00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:38.635
years, so just get used to it.

15
00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.075
Um, but I do wanna give you a quick update

16
00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:42.115
from the elders as well.

17
00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:44.955
As we mentioned previously, we're planning for August

18
00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:47.795
to begin teaching through, uh, what we believe about roles

19
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.275
of women in ministry at Henderson Hills.

20
00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:52.075
And as we included a diverse team

21
00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:55.115
of women along the process in our discussions, we realized

22
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.035
that our positions needed further explanation.

23
00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:00.635
And so we are going to continue working on clarifying that.

24
00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:05.035
And, and our goal is so we can clearly articulate

25
00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:07.715
how every man and every woman in our church can flourish.

26
00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:10.395
And so we want to get that right, excited for that,

27
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.075
have a full position paper

28
00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:15.555
and a teaching associated with that coming hopefully soon.

29
00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:17.435
And so that's just an update for you there.

30
00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:21.915
Uh, today though, as we get into our final parable, uh, one

31
00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:24.315
of my favorite activities at our kids' school is

32
00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:26.595
for the fifth graders every year they take them garage

33
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:29.235
sailing on a Friday in May.

34
00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:32.115
And so it's just fun in general, right?

35
00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:34.355
Traveling around three hours out there.

36
00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:37.235
But, but the class integrates some financial instruction

37
00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:39.795
along the way as well because they give each one

38
00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:42.595
of the students $5 to spend at the garage sale

39
00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:45.475
and they want them to come back with something in,

40
00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:46.755
in special ways.

41
00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:48.915
And so funny to see what the kids value

42
00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:50.835
and what they think in their mind is worth something.

43
00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:53.675
And so, uh, this kid comes back with an old picture frame

44
00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:55.475
and it's a box of AV cables, right?

45
00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:57.115
Just that all that's left.

46
00:02:57.495 --> 00:02:59.430
And this one comes back with an old sleeve

47
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.205
of tennis balls from 1975.

48
00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:03.205
Like who, who knows what that value is, but,

49
00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:06.525
but it's just fun to watch and see how that plays out.

50
00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:09.005
But, but think about what might happen if

51
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.765
that fifth grader gets the $5 and,

52
00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:13.005
and they ride around all morning

53
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:14.725
and they go look at all the garage sales

54
00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:16.165
and they, they see everything

55
00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:19.485
and then when they get back to school, they take the $5

56
00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:20.925
and they hand it back to their teacher.

57
00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:24.825
Now she would look at him funny

58
00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:27.985
and be like, what, what, what are you doing?

59
00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:31.465
'cause the point of the exercise was to

60
00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:34.705
invest the $5 in the pursuit

61
00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:36.785
of finding something more valuable.

62
00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:41.455
Now, of course, the the the school, we get the $5 back,

63
00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:43.335
put it back into petty cash, okay, great.

64
00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:48.695
But remember her instruction was to take the $5

65
00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.815
and turn it into something even better.

66
00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:56.035
That means really there was no way of failing.

67
00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:58.115
You couldn't get an F on the assignment.

68
00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:00.075
You just would need to spend the money

69
00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:02.235
and see what you get back and bring it back

70
00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:06.595
and show the only way to fail would be to not even try,

71
00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:11.615
just 'cause you didn't wanna lose it, didn't wanna waste it.

72
00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:16.785
You brought it back. You know,

73
00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:20.145
actually we're gonna see a very similar idea in the parable

74
00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:23.425
of the Minas today in Luke chapter 19.

75
00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:25.265
So take your copy of God's word

76
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.625
and turn there with me to Luke 19

77
00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:31.465
for the final time in the Book of Luke for now,

78
00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:35.225
Luke chapter 19 verses 11 through 27 is

79
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:36.705
where we're gonna see this parable.

80
00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:40.525
Now I said it's the parable of the Minas

81
00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:41.685
and we're not really familiar with that term.

82
00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:43.765
I'll explain it in a moment. Some of you might be familiar

83
00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:45.365
with the parable of the talents

84
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:47.645
that's over in Matthew chapter 25.

85
00:04:47.835 --> 00:04:50.045
It's very similar in the way that they're set up

86
00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:51.525
and the way they talk about things.

87
00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:53.365
But there's slight differences

88
00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:54.805
that we'll see, especially here.

89
00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:57.085
And so when, when we look at that Matthew

90
00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:59.045
and Luke, were they recording the same event,

91
00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.965
like the same speech Jesus gave

92
00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:02.805
or were there different occasions they

93
00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:03.965
heard these varieties?

94
00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:05.405
We don't know exactly,

95
00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:07.285
but what we do know is

96
00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:09.445
that this is gonna challenge us today.

97
00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:11.965
God's word will challenge us.

98
00:05:13.165 --> 00:05:15.445
'cause remember what Jesus was doing with the parables?

99
00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:17.085
He was dividing,

100
00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:21.125
he was separating people in the kingdom mentality.

101
00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:24.005
So he was asking the question with every parable,

102
00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:26.045
are you a kingdom citizen or not?

103
00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:28.445
Are you in or are you out?

104
00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:31.165
Are you gonna live according to the kingdom or are you not?

105
00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:36.405
This one will be very, very clear about how that works out.

106
00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:40.395
I wanna read verse 11 just to start with,

107
00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:42.955
because it provides the context for the parable.

108
00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:47.885
Luke 19 verse 11, as they heard these things, he proceeded

109
00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:51.365
to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and

110
00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:53.725
because they suppose that the kingdom of God was

111
00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:55.085
to appear immediately.

112
00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:59.645
Okay? So what are these things that they heard?

113
00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:01.325
Who were they? They were the disciples.

114
00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:02.725
Most likely those committed to Jesus.

115
00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:05.205
But, but what are these things that they heard

116
00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:07.455
which prompted Jesus

117
00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:09.295
to then tell the parable that we're about to study?

118
00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:12.045
Well, it's the account right

119
00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:15.005
before this, the account of Jesus with Zacchaeus.

120
00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:19.085
Remember who Zacchaeus was that that we little man

121
00:06:19.795 --> 00:06:22.925
climbed up in a sycamore tree for the Lord?

122
00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:27.005
He wanted to see when the Savior passed that way,

123
00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:28.965
he looked up in the tree

124
00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:32.845
and he said, Zacchaeus, you come down.

125
00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.325
I'm going to your house.

126
00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:36.805
Okay, so if you're completely lost,

127
00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:38.085
that's an old Sunday school song.

128
00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:40.125
Many of us grew up in church.

129
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:41.725
We're like, oh yeah, that clearly matches.

130
00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:43.925
But that's how we know the story, right? It, it matches.

131
00:06:43.995 --> 00:06:46.725
It's exactly right. But that that's

132
00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:48.845
what happened in the scene was not just

133
00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:50.605
that Jesus interacted with this guy in the tree.

134
00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:52.525
It was that Jesus totally changed

135
00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:55.805
this rebellious tax collector's life

136
00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:59.525
from darkness to light, death to life.

137
00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:01.725
Verses eight and nine, look up at it.

138
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:04.525
Jesus said what he said to Zacchaeus.

139
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:05.525
And Zacchaeus stood

140
00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:07.805
and said to the Lord, behold, Lord, the half

141
00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:11.205
of my goods I give to the poor, if I've defrauded anyone

142
00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:13.765
of anything, I restore it fourfold.

143
00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:15.045
That's repentance, right?

144
00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:19.245
And Jesus said to him, today, salvation has come

145
00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:22.325
to this house since he also is a son of Abraham,

146
00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:25.885
meaning this, this rebellious turncoat.

147
00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:29.685
He's welcome in the kingdom of God by faith.

148
00:07:31.475 --> 00:07:35.125
Then Jesus gives his his mission statement, his thesis.

149
00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.205
Verse 10, for the son of man, that's Jesus, the son

150
00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:41.765
of man came to seek and to save the lost.

151
00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:46.785
That's what the disciples had just heard.

152
00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:48.985
They heard these things

153
00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:54.485
and what their minds then immediately went to verse 11 says,

154
00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:57.805
was they suppose Now the kingdom of God was imminence.

155
00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:02.155
Like we heard, we watched this with Zacchaeus.

156
00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:05.195
We heard what Jesus said that the son of man, that's,

157
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:06.195
that's a kingdom idea.

158
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:09.315
That's a prophecy idea. Okay? The kingdom of God is coming.

159
00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:10.555
He's gonna save the lost.

160
00:08:10.905 --> 00:08:15.695
This must be the time that kingdom is coming. It is now.

161
00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:18.375
It's imminent. 'cause they knew the promises,

162
00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:20.455
they knew the prophets were the ones

163
00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:22.575
who predicted when the kingdom of God showed up,

164
00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.895
the lost were gonna be saved,

165
00:08:25.175 --> 00:08:28.855
creation was gonna be restored, knew life was gonna come.

166
00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:31.895
That they saw this in, in Zia's story.

167
00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:33.175
They were like, oh, this is it.

168
00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:35.415
So they were expecting the Messiah.

169
00:08:37.095 --> 00:08:40.705
They knew the Messiah was coming to bring this kingdom

170
00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:45.735
to bear the previous 400 years

171
00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:48.815
from what they had experienced in this moment, 400 years

172
00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:51.295
before there was total silence from God.

173
00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:54.735
But they still had those promises from

174
00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:59.145
before that they knew that God had promised a messiah

175
00:08:59.145 --> 00:09:01.545
to come and they were looking for the Messiah.

176
00:09:01.565 --> 00:09:05.835
But here's the problem. Over those years,

177
00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:10.835
the expectation of that Messiah had shifted to become more

178
00:09:10.835 --> 00:09:13.235
of a political and military figure.

179
00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:16.705
And they were looking for someone

180
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:19.305
to drive out the hated Roman empire,

181
00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:22.745
to give God's people their land back exclusively.

182
00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:25.625
And and through those 400 years, a couple people popped up

183
00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:27.825
and it, it looked like they might be the one,

184
00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:29.545
but then they were squashed.

185
00:09:30.205 --> 00:09:33.245
And so they kept looking, kept looking and kept looking.

186
00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:37.855
And this might be the one, not only that.

187
00:09:38.955 --> 00:09:40.055
Did you see what verse 11?

188
00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:42.695
Where was Jesus headed at this moment?

189
00:09:44.535 --> 00:09:46.715
He was headed to Jerusalem, which was the capital

190
00:09:46.885 --> 00:09:49.355
where the temple was, where kind of the, the seat

191
00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.315
of everything like that was gonna be the place

192
00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:52.475
where the Messiah came back

193
00:09:52.495 --> 00:09:54.875
and was gonna destroy the hated Romans.

194
00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:56.595
They were sure Jesus is going

195
00:09:56.775 --> 00:09:58.635
to Jerusalem to win the victory.

196
00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:06.405
That's why Jesus told the parable he wanted

197
00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:10.085
to reorient their minds away from looking merely

198
00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.685
for this earthly savior.

199
00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:16.575
To something a little bit more though, immediately

200
00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:20.295
after this, starting in verse 28, which is

201
00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:22.295
after our parable today, immediately

202
00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:25.295
after this they celebrated Jesus walking into Jerusalem,

203
00:10:25.315 --> 00:10:26.895
the triumphal entry, you know palm

204
00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:28.415
branches, hosanna, save us.

205
00:10:28.435 --> 00:10:30.535
You are the the king who comes in the name of the Lord.

206
00:10:30.535 --> 00:10:31.735
They're saying all of that.

207
00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:33.695
But they failed to realize

208
00:10:36.425 --> 00:10:40.995
that he was coming to Jerusalem to win an eternal victory

209
00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:42.835
through his life, death and resurrection.

210
00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:45.865
It wasn't to drive out the Romans, it was

211
00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:49.625
to win the eternal victory over sin and darkness and death.

212
00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:54.625
They missed it. They were not expecting that kind

213
00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:59.265
of a triumph, that though they were expecting the Messiah,

214
00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:00.625
they missed the fact

215
00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:03.105
that they were actually seeing the king right now.

216
00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:07.735
They were expecting the kingdom to come imminently

217
00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:08.735
that this was gonna happen.

218
00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:11.255
But they missed the fact that this was the king

219
00:11:12.095 --> 00:11:14.125
right in front of them for three years.

220
00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:17.005
The king was there who came

221
00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:19.725
for a higher reason than what they had expected.

222
00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:27.785
So Jesus, by telling this parable, he's dividing people

223
00:11:28.295 --> 00:11:32.265
according to the kingdom that he says to them as you'll see,

224
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:35.385
that that kingdom that they're looking for is not merely

225
00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:39.355
for their own comforts, just make their life better,

226
00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:41.515
make it easier to live in the land.

227
00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:44.635
That's not why the kingdom first and foremost came

228
00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:49.675
because what Jesus says here is he actually shows the

229
00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:51.755
kingdom of God is pretty demanding.

230
00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:56.735
We will see it here that the kingdom they're looking

231
00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:58.375
for is demanding.

232
00:12:01.615 --> 00:12:06.055
In other words, what was this king coming to expect of us?

233
00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:11.005
What was he requiring of kingdom citizens?

234
00:12:12.435 --> 00:12:14.645
This is the parable verses 11 through 27.

235
00:12:17.295 --> 00:12:19.875
As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell the parable

236
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:21.355
because he was near to Jerusalem

237
00:12:21.355 --> 00:12:23.075
because they suppose the kingdom of God was

238
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.075
to appear immediately.

239
00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:28.275
And he said, therefore a noble man went into a far country

240
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.995
to receive for himself a kingdom

241
00:12:30.175 --> 00:12:33.995
and then return calling 10 of his servants.

242
00:12:34.015 --> 00:12:35.595
He gave them 10 minas.

243
00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:37.955
Now a min, let me explain what that is,

244
00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:42.715
is about three months worth of income for a common laborer.

245
00:12:43.695 --> 00:12:46.395
So just think we might imagine $8,000

246
00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:48.075
for example, as an estimate.

247
00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:50.955
So he gave 10 servants each one min.

248
00:12:51.015 --> 00:12:53.995
And he said to them, engage in business until I come.

249
00:12:55.255 --> 00:12:58.075
But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation

250
00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:00.995
after him saying, we do not want this man to reign over us.

251
00:13:02.575 --> 00:13:04.675
And when he returned having received the kingdom,

252
00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:07.035
he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money

253
00:13:07.035 --> 00:13:08.475
to be called to him that he might know

254
00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:10.515
what they had gained by doing business.

255
00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:13.515
The first came before him saying, Lord,

256
00:13:13.665 --> 00:13:17.515
your min has made 10 minus more said to him, well done,

257
00:13:17.515 --> 00:13:19.595
good servant because you've been faithful in a very little,

258
00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:21.395
you shall have authority over 10 cities.

259
00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:24.025
And the second came saying, Lord,

260
00:13:24.025 --> 00:13:25.265
your min has made five minus.

261
00:13:26.165 --> 00:13:28.265
And he said to him, you are to be over five cities.

262
00:13:29.965 --> 00:13:33.425
And then another came saying, Lord, here's your minora,

263
00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:36.945
which I kept laid away in a handkerchief for I was afraid

264
00:13:36.945 --> 00:13:40.475
of you 'cause you're a severe man, you take

265
00:13:40.475 --> 00:13:43.395
what you did not deposit you, reap what you did not sow.

266
00:13:45.195 --> 00:13:46.335
And the king said to him, I

267
00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:47.415
will condemn you with your own words.

268
00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:51.375
You wicked servant. You knew that I was a severe man taking

269
00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:53.935
what I did not deposit, reaping what I did not sow.

270
00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:56.895
Why then did you not put my money in the bank And at my

271
00:13:56.895 --> 00:13:58.575
coming I might have collected it with interest.

272
00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:02.765
And he said to those who stood by, take the minor from him

273
00:14:02.765 --> 00:14:04.565
and give it to the one who has the 10 minus.

274
00:14:05.685 --> 00:14:07.665
And they said to him, Lord, he he already has 10 minus.

275
00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:11.545
I tell you that to everyone who has more will be given,

276
00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:13.985
but from the one who has not even

277
00:14:14.175 --> 00:14:15.785
what he has will be taken away.

278
00:14:17.435 --> 00:14:20.135
But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me

279
00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:23.655
to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them

280
00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:27.995
before me, great

281
00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:29.115
end to the parables right?

282
00:14:31.315 --> 00:14:33.055
Now here's what's interesting about this parable

283
00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:35.295
because if you really dig into it, you see

284
00:14:35.325 --> 00:14:37.735
that there's actually two plot lines going

285
00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:38.895
in the same parable.

286
00:14:39.815 --> 00:14:41.225
They both have to do with this noble

287
00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:42.465
man receiving a kingdom.

288
00:14:43.645 --> 00:14:46.785
But there's first this group of just average citizens

289
00:14:46.965 --> 00:14:49.025
who reject him as their king.

290
00:14:50.635 --> 00:14:53.605
And then there's this group of 10 servants who are charged

291
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:56.165
with faithfully stewarding all

292
00:14:56.165 --> 00:14:57.725
that the king is entrusted to them.

293
00:14:58.715 --> 00:15:00.975
So they kind of run parallel, they mix a little bit, but it,

294
00:15:00.995 --> 00:15:02.175
but in essence they're separate.

295
00:15:02.175 --> 00:15:03.295
So we're gonna take 'em separately

296
00:15:03.295 --> 00:15:05.415
and see what Jesus was doing with these.

297
00:15:08.285 --> 00:15:10.145
And so first we, the challenge here,

298
00:15:10.975 --> 00:15:12.705
what we learned from this first parable is

299
00:15:12.705 --> 00:15:16.375
that we must welcome the king just base truth

300
00:15:16.435 --> 00:15:19.455
as you dig into this, we must welcome the king.

301
00:15:22.175 --> 00:15:25.195
So this wealthy man went into a far country to receive

302
00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:27.275
for himself a kingdom and then return.

303
00:15:27.295 --> 00:15:30.955
We might say that he was inaugurated as the king.

304
00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:35.655
Well then how did those average citizens respond

305
00:15:35.915 --> 00:15:37.015
to his inauguration?

306
00:15:37.025 --> 00:15:41.455
Verse 14, his citizens hated him and sent a delegation

307
00:15:41.465 --> 00:15:45.615
after him saying, we do not want this man to reign over us.

308
00:15:47.965 --> 00:15:51.145
And then Jesus goes on, as Luke records it,

309
00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:53.785
to talk a lot about stewardship and giving Minas

310
00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:54.905
and receiving those back

311
00:15:54.905 --> 00:15:56.585
and talking about rewards and everything.

312
00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:59.665
And then that plot line shows up again down in verse

313
00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:00.945
27 at the very end.

314
00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:06.085
But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me

315
00:16:06.085 --> 00:16:07.845
to reign over them, right, that's that group,

316
00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:11.925
bring them here and slaughter them before me.

317
00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:19.005
Alright, so just two verses essentially, right?

318
00:16:19.675 --> 00:16:22.165
This, this parallel plot line is,

319
00:16:22.185 --> 00:16:25.965
is really just two verses about this group of people and,

320
00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:28.485
and they reject this man as their king.

321
00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:31.765
He calls them his enemies and he has them destroyed.

322
00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:34.935
That's it. Two verses you can't get around.

323
00:16:34.935 --> 00:16:36.815
Like that's not complicated, it's straightforward.

324
00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:42.745
So what do we do with that? What do we do with that?

325
00:16:43.185 --> 00:16:44.665
A lot of people try to write that off and

326
00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:46.185
and say, well that's not really what it means.

327
00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:48.105
And all those things just symbolism, those kind of things.

328
00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:51.025
But, but actually what this is is prophetic language

329
00:16:51.335 --> 00:16:53.385
that is intended to shock us

330
00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:56.145
and it's intended to spark some introspection

331
00:16:56.325 --> 00:16:59.985
and some examination thinking about questions in my mind of

332
00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.585
what this is saying.

333
00:17:03.385 --> 00:17:04.485
And Luke's not the first person,

334
00:17:04.495 --> 00:17:05.845
Jesus in the first person to do this.

335
00:17:05.845 --> 00:17:08.165
This is all the way from the Old Testament prophets.

336
00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.965
Like we'll see in the book of Micah starting next week

337
00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:13.645
as we walk through the fall in Micah,

338
00:17:14.275 --> 00:17:18.605
they use language like this intending people

339
00:17:18.945 --> 00:17:23.305
to understand that there is a warning here

340
00:17:23.305 --> 00:17:24.745
that they need to take seriously.

341
00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:32.235
Like when that when that tornado siren goes off, it's,

342
00:17:32.465 --> 00:17:34.675
it's not meant for you to just go about your normal life

343
00:17:34.675 --> 00:17:36.985
when you hear that, I know

344
00:17:37.185 --> 00:17:38.345
Saturdays at noon is different, okay?

345
00:17:38.345 --> 00:17:41.705
But we're not talking about that. We're talking about like

346
00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:44.105
when that thing goes off you just

347
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.185
keep playing the switch, right?

348
00:17:45.185 --> 00:17:46.265
Is that no, you don't do that.

349
00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.865
You're like, oh, I need to be aware of something that's

350
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.165
that's a problem potentially coming my way.

351
00:17:51.585 --> 00:17:53.605
Let me look at my phone, let me look at the tv.

352
00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:55.365
Let me understand what's happening right now.

353
00:17:55.505 --> 00:17:58.325
Should I be worried? That's what this is.

354
00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:02.795
It's a warning meant to spark something in our hearts

355
00:18:03.355 --> 00:18:04.635
questions wonderings.

356
00:18:07.485 --> 00:18:09.945
And so Jesus is doing that with this scene.

357
00:18:11.335 --> 00:18:14.725
By the way, if this is merely symbolism, that means

358
00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:17.925
what he's symbolizing is worse than what it actually is.

359
00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.605
So if his enemies are slaughtered in front of him, like

360
00:18:20.605 --> 00:18:22.325
what do you want that to be symbols for?

361
00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:27.195
This is the tragedy of rejecting the king.

362
00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:31.025
And now remember Jesus is talking about

363
00:18:31.025 --> 00:18:32.145
the kingdom of God here.

364
00:18:32.205 --> 00:18:35.105
So who's the king he's referring to here?

365
00:18:36.245 --> 00:18:39.955
It's him that Jesus is the king and

366
00:18:40.055 --> 00:18:42.755
and that's the question he's getting people to ask here.

367
00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:45.795
As he tells this to the people around him, he says,

368
00:18:46.175 --> 00:18:49.275
do you want me to reign over you or not?

369
00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:52.625
It's basic simple.

370
00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:57.105
Do you want me, are you willing to welcome me as your king

371
00:18:57.245 --> 00:18:58.825
and all that that entails?

372
00:18:59.285 --> 00:19:01.065
Do you want me to be your king or not?

373
00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:07.545
So when we think about that today, the obvious application

374
00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:09.505
of course is first for the unbeliever.

375
00:19:11.665 --> 00:19:15.315
That if that's you and you have rejected Jesus as your king,

376
00:19:17.075 --> 00:19:20.085
then we see the ramifications of that decision.

377
00:19:22.515 --> 00:19:24.815
If he is the king, then you have no right

378
00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:25.975
to shake your fist at him.

379
00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:30.595
He is the king whether we want to believe that or not.

380
00:19:31.575 --> 00:19:36.165
And the results of refusing him, rejecting him are tragic.

381
00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:43.275
But there's a way to get into the kingdom, to be received

382
00:19:43.825 --> 00:19:45.195
into his kingdom.

383
00:19:45.415 --> 00:19:48.235
And the way you welcome the king is

384
00:19:48.235 --> 00:19:49.595
through humble repentance.

385
00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:54.305
That's what the, the word of God says repeatedly is.

386
00:19:54.305 --> 00:19:57.425
The way that you come in is by repentance and faith.

387
00:19:57.425 --> 00:19:59.425
That word repentance means a change of mind

388
00:19:59.685 --> 00:20:03.865
and a change of direction that you turn from your sin

389
00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:08.025
and yourself as the king and you turn to Jesus as your king.

390
00:20:09.245 --> 00:20:12.025
And you say, that's done. I'm in for you.

391
00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:15.665
You turn to the one now. Now this is, this is good news.

392
00:20:17.165 --> 00:20:20.865
You turn to the one who was slaughtered for you,

393
00:20:22.715 --> 00:20:24.225
which was predicted 700 years

394
00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:26.105
before Jesus even came on the scene.

395
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:31.425
Isaiah 53 says that exact thing, it prophesies

396
00:20:31.425 --> 00:20:34.265
that this messiah, this savior, he was pierced

397
00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:37.905
for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities.

398
00:20:38.735 --> 00:20:41.345
Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace

399
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:42.625
with his wounds.

400
00:20:42.885 --> 00:20:45.385
We are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray.

401
00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:46.985
We've turned every one of us to our own way,

402
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.445
way which is sin rebellion.

403
00:20:49.585 --> 00:20:52.365
And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

404
00:20:52.365 --> 00:20:54.165
That's Isaiah 53, 5 and six.

405
00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:59.205
So you can't, you can't mindfulness

406
00:20:59.315 --> 00:21:00.445
your way outta this problem.

407
00:21:00.985 --> 00:21:02.885
You can't better behave your way out of this.

408
00:21:02.885 --> 00:21:07.605
This is Jesus offering the solution to sin and rebellion.

409
00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:09.885
It's humble repentance and faith in him.

410
00:21:12.415 --> 00:21:14.075
So that's for you unbeliever.

411
00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:16.395
That's that's this application.

412
00:21:18.885 --> 00:21:21.425
But there's also an application here, even dealing

413
00:21:21.425 --> 00:21:23.425
with welcoming the king for you believer.

414
00:21:25.615 --> 00:21:28.755
See the nature of the entire parable is that there is a king

415
00:21:28.815 --> 00:21:29.835
who is in charge.

416
00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:34.255
There's a king who is reigning.

417
00:21:36.715 --> 00:21:39.415
Yet the reality of the human ego

418
00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:46.815
is that we can find nearly limitless reasons why no one

419
00:21:46.815 --> 00:21:47.815
should reign over us.

420
00:21:49.195 --> 00:21:50.495
No one can tell us what to do.

421
00:21:51.475 --> 00:21:53.415
No one can correct me when I'm wrong.

422
00:21:55.395 --> 00:21:59.815
Is that not innate, innate to us? Even as believers?

423
00:21:59.815 --> 00:22:01.735
Like that's not immediately gone when you come

424
00:22:01.735 --> 00:22:03.295
to Christ like that, that's still being

425
00:22:03.295 --> 00:22:04.375
worked out of your soul.

426
00:22:04.425 --> 00:22:05.975
Every single one of us.

427
00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:10.535
So even us as believers must welcome the king

428
00:22:10.675 --> 00:22:12.775
and his kingship over our lives.

429
00:22:15.115 --> 00:22:16.535
How do we do that? Well, we're continually

430
00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:17.775
repenting our lives as well.

431
00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:20.415
But but humble commitment is

432
00:22:20.415 --> 00:22:25.215
how we welcome the king over us in our lives as believers.

433
00:22:26.075 --> 00:22:28.855
We must humbly commit to him as well

434
00:22:30.925 --> 00:22:34.475
where he calls the shots, he directs traffic, he tells us

435
00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:35.875
how to live our lives.

436
00:22:36.175 --> 00:22:40.675
That's where we commit to king Jesus telling us

437
00:22:41.295 --> 00:22:45.535
how to spend our money, telling us

438
00:22:45.915 --> 00:22:48.655
how we, we invest our time,

439
00:22:50.525 --> 00:22:53.935
telling us how we relate to people of the opposite sex

440
00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:58.335
that he calls the shots on that that, that he's telling us

441
00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:02.495
how we work, how we go to school, how we think,

442
00:23:02.755 --> 00:23:03.815
how we speak.

443
00:23:03.995 --> 00:23:06.975
He is in charge telling us all of that of we committed

444
00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:08.535
to him as our king.

445
00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:14.925
'cause that leads us directly into the second plot line

446
00:23:14.925 --> 00:23:19.855
of this parable that those of us who have committed to him

447
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:24.425
as our king, we must not only welcome the king,

448
00:23:24.425 --> 00:23:26.545
we must also steward his kingdom.

449
00:23:27.015 --> 00:23:30.905
Then as a result, if we've committed to him as king,

450
00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:32.425
we steward his kingdom.

451
00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:35.685
Now that's our assignment.

452
00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:41.605
'cause remember when Jesus was telling this parable,

453
00:23:41.605 --> 00:23:43.605
he was illustrating not some new investment

454
00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:45.365
strategy like how to make more money.

455
00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.325
And that's what, that's no, that's not at all.

456
00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:49.365
He's talking about the nature of his kingdom.

457
00:23:51.185 --> 00:23:53.195
He's talking about kingdom business here.

458
00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:55.955
He's saying here's how you invest your life for the kingdom

459
00:23:56.055 --> 00:23:58.115
and here's what's gonna happen on the back end of that.

460
00:23:59.505 --> 00:24:01.525
So when we look at this parable through that lens,

461
00:24:01.625 --> 00:24:04.485
we clearly see our assignment right?

462
00:24:05.985 --> 00:24:10.045
Our assignment is very clear from this parable.

463
00:24:12.415 --> 00:24:14.195
And here's what I want you to see in this too.

464
00:24:15.255 --> 00:24:18.305
This is not just for pastors and missionaries.

465
00:24:20.215 --> 00:24:23.665
This parable, this kingdom assignment

466
00:24:25.205 --> 00:24:28.845
was spoken to all of them right now.

467
00:24:28.955 --> 00:24:32.525
He's telling this parable to all of us, not just those of us

468
00:24:32.525 --> 00:24:34.645
who called into vocational ministry or or whatever.

469
00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:37.205
Like yeah, that's your job. As your assignment is clear, no,

470
00:24:37.235 --> 00:24:40.325
this is your assignment too believer if you've committed

471
00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:42.605
to the king, the king says, here's how you go about this.

472
00:24:45.445 --> 00:24:47.285
'cause remember he calls these 10 servants together

473
00:24:48.065 --> 00:24:52.045
and he gives each one of them one minor, one sum of money.

474
00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:56.765
And in verse 13 he says, explicitly engage in business

475
00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:58.005
with it until I return.

476
00:24:59.425 --> 00:25:01.285
And that word engage in business in the Greek,

477
00:25:01.425 --> 00:25:03.725
the original language, it means put that money to work,

478
00:25:05.135 --> 00:25:06.765
trade it, start using it

479
00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:08.485
and trying to get a return on it, right?

480
00:25:08.555 --> 00:25:12.045
He's, he expected the return when he came back.

481
00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:18.255
That means the king did not leave those minas

482
00:25:18.635 --> 00:25:20.015
merely for safekeeping.

483
00:25:20.555 --> 00:25:22.375
He left them for investment

484
00:25:24.255 --> 00:25:26.995
and two of the servants did well, but one did not.

485
00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:32.755
So what did he leave for us today as his servants?

486
00:25:32.755 --> 00:25:35.755
What did he leave for us to invest like this?

487
00:25:35.865 --> 00:25:39.155
It's not money necessarily pure form like a min,

488
00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:40.595
it's something else.

489
00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:44.335
What did he leave? Well, first

490
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:45.615
and foremost, it's the message

491
00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:47.935
and the values of the kingdom of God

492
00:25:50.035 --> 00:25:52.485
that the king has come and has

493
00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:55.405
provided a way for us to be reconciled to him

494
00:25:55.465 --> 00:25:57.245
and thus reconciled to one another.

495
00:25:58.455 --> 00:26:00.515
That's the message of the kingdom.

496
00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:02.595
It's what second Corinthians five verses 18

497
00:26:02.595 --> 00:26:03.755
through 20 says very clearly.

498
00:26:05.245 --> 00:26:09.025
All this is from God who through Christ reconciled us

499
00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:12.145
to himself, gave us the ministry

500
00:26:12.325 --> 00:26:15.065
of reconciliation that is in Christ.

501
00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:16.905
God was reconciling the world to himself,

502
00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:21.265
not counting the trespasses against them, entrusting to us

503
00:26:22.785 --> 00:26:24.445
the message of reconciliation.

504
00:26:26.445 --> 00:26:29.855
Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ.

505
00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:32.375
That's ambassadors like you've been entrusted with authority

506
00:26:32.595 --> 00:26:34.855
by on behalf of your country to go to somebody else, right?

507
00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:37.655
You are an ambassador. That's an entrusting idea.

508
00:26:37.765 --> 00:26:41.215
Even more God making his appeal through us.

509
00:26:41.315 --> 00:26:44.165
So now we're vessels of God's work, work in the world.

510
00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:47.645
We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

511
00:26:48.785 --> 00:26:51.525
You see this entrusting language of the ministry

512
00:26:51.545 --> 00:26:54.605
and message of reconciliation of the kingdom of God.

513
00:26:56.535 --> 00:26:58.195
And so here's what that means, just base level.

514
00:26:58.905 --> 00:27:03.375
That means that our job as believers

515
00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:07.695
is not to try

516
00:27:07.755 --> 00:27:10.135
and maintain some Christian subculture,

517
00:27:12.685 --> 00:27:15.575
some Christian bubble like so we can live comfortably

518
00:27:15.575 --> 00:27:18.055
and we can live safe and we can be in our little world

519
00:27:18.115 --> 00:27:19.455
and we're all protected.

520
00:27:19.455 --> 00:27:20.935
That's not the goal here.

521
00:27:21.235 --> 00:27:24.415
Our job is to invest our lives

522
00:27:24.515 --> 00:27:27.895
and to invest the principles of the kingdom for his purposes

523
00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:31.525
out there, right?

524
00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:33.845
I I think of people like George Mueller starting an

525
00:27:33.845 --> 00:27:35.565
orphanage in the 18 hundreds.

526
00:27:35.645 --> 00:27:37.045
I think of people like Hudson Taylor

527
00:27:37.385 --> 00:27:39.005
who started the China Inland mission

528
00:27:39.135 --> 00:27:40.365
going on mission, the 18 hundreds.

529
00:27:40.365 --> 00:27:43.445
I think of John Wesley whose phrase just is such a

530
00:27:43.445 --> 00:27:44.485
beautiful thing.

531
00:27:44.555 --> 00:27:47.165
He's saying, the world is my parish.

532
00:27:48.235 --> 00:27:50.765
Like parish meaning like the group of people

533
00:27:50.765 --> 00:27:51.925
that you're supposed to shepherd.

534
00:27:52.235 --> 00:27:56.585
He's like the world is, you think of the early church

535
00:27:56.965 --> 00:27:59.585
who went about as they were scattered by persecution.

536
00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:02.265
They went about doing what? Preaching the word

537
00:28:06.175 --> 00:28:09.065
countless others today, investing their lives

538
00:28:09.485 --> 00:28:11.185
for the king and his kingdom.

539
00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:14.215
Like don't overcomplicate this.

540
00:28:14.245 --> 00:28:18.335
This is merely taking whatever time and talents

541
00:28:18.475 --> 00:28:21.295
and treasures that God has entrusted to you

542
00:28:21.555 --> 00:28:26.455
and utilizing them for his purposes first, right?

543
00:28:26.475 --> 00:28:29.455
He, he, this is not ownership here.

544
00:28:29.965 --> 00:28:32.095
This is stewardship, right? You understand the difference.

545
00:28:33.935 --> 00:28:35.265
They didn't own that minea.

546
00:28:35.335 --> 00:28:36.945
That was the owners, that was the masters.

547
00:28:37.535 --> 00:28:38.825
They were stewards of it.

548
00:28:38.885 --> 00:28:41.905
And so when we think we own all of this, our time, talent,

549
00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:44.065
treasures all of our lives, our bodies, our stuff,

550
00:28:44.215 --> 00:28:45.625
then we call the shots.

551
00:28:45.845 --> 00:28:48.345
If we're stewards of all of it, he calls the shots,

552
00:28:49.285 --> 00:28:51.185
he directs it, he tells us how to use it

553
00:28:51.405 --> 00:28:52.705
and he gives it to us

554
00:28:52.805 --> 00:28:55.985
and trusts it to us for his purpose first.

555
00:28:56.285 --> 00:28:58.505
And then we reap the benefits after that.

556
00:28:59.645 --> 00:29:01.145
It should be first and foremost his

557
00:29:01.485 --> 00:29:02.705
the way he wants to use it.

558
00:29:02.845 --> 00:29:04.385
And then we get whatever's left over

559
00:29:05.185 --> 00:29:06.455
which will always take care of us.

560
00:29:06.455 --> 00:29:07.455
Don't think he's not going to.

561
00:29:07.595 --> 00:29:08.775
But you see the principle,

562
00:29:08.795 --> 00:29:10.975
the way those change our mindsets, right?

563
00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:17.535
And what we do is we invest for his kingdom is we trust him

564
00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:20.855
for whatever profit he wants to bring outta that investment.

565
00:29:22.105 --> 00:29:25.345
'cause the work is his. He brings the fruit, not us.

566
00:29:25.845 --> 00:29:27.105
We are called to invest.

567
00:29:27.645 --> 00:29:31.905
He brings whatever fruit he wants, it's his ministry.

568
00:29:33.695 --> 00:29:36.235
That's our assignment believer.

569
00:29:36.335 --> 00:29:39.715
That's your assignment is to invest in the kingdom of God.

570
00:29:41.465 --> 00:29:42.685
And also see here

571
00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:44.925
that your reward is contingent on how you do that.

572
00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:50.255
Your reward is contingent on how well you do that.

573
00:29:51.315 --> 00:29:54.335
You saw the different reactions that the king had

574
00:29:54.335 --> 00:29:55.615
to the different servants, right?

575
00:29:56.975 --> 00:30:01.235
The first one turned one into 10, verse 17, well done.

576
00:30:01.235 --> 00:30:02.995
Good servant. You've been faithful in a very little,

577
00:30:02.995 --> 00:30:04.475
you'll have authority over 10 cities.

578
00:30:04.535 --> 00:30:05.915
Now we don't know what that means fully,

579
00:30:06.255 --> 00:30:08.355
but all it illustrates is

580
00:30:08.355 --> 00:30:12.635
how extravagant God's reward system is, right?

581
00:30:12.635 --> 00:30:15.155
Like you can't buy one city

582
00:30:15.655 --> 00:30:17.675
for $80,000, let alone 10 cities.

583
00:30:18.655 --> 00:30:22.555
And somehow this king is just like, yeah,

584
00:30:22.555 --> 00:30:23.795
here's all the authority over these.

585
00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:27.915
Like, whoa, we have to think through how amazing

586
00:30:28.255 --> 00:30:30.715
and abundant God's reward system is.

587
00:30:33.285 --> 00:30:34.935
There's a second servant turned one minus

588
00:30:34.965 --> 00:30:36.175
into five, similar response.

589
00:30:36.175 --> 00:30:37.615
Verse 19, you'd be over five cities.

590
00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.625
Now here's, I, I mentioned the parable,

591
00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:43.185
the talents in Matthew 25 earlier.

592
00:30:43.295 --> 00:30:45.585
This is where it kind of balances out a little bit

593
00:30:45.585 --> 00:30:47.505
and it adds a better element I think to this

594
00:30:47.505 --> 00:30:50.465
because the master in that parable responds to both

595
00:30:50.465 --> 00:30:53.105
of these first two servants identically.

596
00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:56.225
He says the exact same thing, which we can kind

597
00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:58.225
of imply here in Luke 19,

598
00:30:58.225 --> 00:31:00.105
that he would've said the same thing to the second.

599
00:31:00.245 --> 00:31:03.425
But it's explicit in Matthew 25 verse 21.

600
00:31:03.645 --> 00:31:06.505
He said to both of those two servants, well done,

601
00:31:06.895 --> 00:31:07.945
good and faithful servant.

602
00:31:08.085 --> 00:31:09.345
You've been faithful over little.

603
00:31:09.575 --> 00:31:12.705
I'll set you over much enter into the joy of your master.

604
00:31:15.245 --> 00:31:17.145
So here's the point. It didn't matter

605
00:31:19.045 --> 00:31:22.865
what those two servants started with, all

606
00:31:22.865 --> 00:31:24.025
that mattered was their faithfulness.

607
00:31:25.235 --> 00:31:26.535
You've been given five, you've been given

608
00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:27.735
two, you've been given one.

609
00:31:27.735 --> 00:31:29.695
It doesn't matter. Just be faithful with

610
00:31:29.695 --> 00:31:32.655
what you have been given and they got the exact same

611
00:31:32.975 --> 00:31:34.295
response from the king.

612
00:31:36.975 --> 00:31:38.395
So here's what I, what I'm getting with this.

613
00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:44.425
You should not worry about what other believers are doing.

614
00:31:46.655 --> 00:31:48.635
Now, in one way, I listen to what I'm saying.

615
00:31:48.975 --> 00:31:50.395
Yes, we should care about each other, but,

616
00:31:50.395 --> 00:31:53.195
but we should not play some comparison game

617
00:31:53.195 --> 00:31:54.515
between spiritual gifts.

618
00:31:57.095 --> 00:32:01.925
You have an audience of one. You are to use your gifts.

619
00:32:02.065 --> 00:32:03.845
I'm to use my gifts solely.

620
00:32:05.365 --> 00:32:07.615
Paul says this in in the pastoral epistles.

621
00:32:07.615 --> 00:32:11.375
He's like, my goal is to please him. That is all I'm about.

622
00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:15.155
So I have to say something that's hard,

623
00:32:15.945 --> 00:32:17.075
have a hard conversation.

624
00:32:17.515 --> 00:32:21.695
I have to, to lead towards something that is he pleased.

625
00:32:21.695 --> 00:32:23.415
That's my goal. Same for you.

626
00:32:24.115 --> 00:32:25.855
It doesn't matter what he's entrusted to you.

627
00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:29.015
Maybe he's gonna work through somebody publicly more than,

628
00:32:29.045 --> 00:32:30.175
than he would through you.

629
00:32:31.325 --> 00:32:32.865
Praise God. The kingdom's growing.

630
00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:34.465
You be faithful with what he's given you.

631
00:32:37.315 --> 00:32:38.365
This, this is a little harder.

632
00:32:40.255 --> 00:32:43.025
What if God chooses to work in massive ways

633
00:32:43.025 --> 00:32:44.385
through another church in our city?

634
00:32:48.155 --> 00:32:52.915
Praise God. Because the kingdom is growing, right?

635
00:32:52.975 --> 00:32:55.195
And we be faithful with what he's given us.

636
00:32:55.335 --> 00:32:59.005
That's all we do. All our job is to be faithful with

637
00:32:59.005 --> 00:33:00.445
what he's entrusted to us.

638
00:33:00.465 --> 00:33:02.525
If he's choose to do something else through somebody else,

639
00:33:02.625 --> 00:33:04.085
that's totally his call.

640
00:33:04.225 --> 00:33:06.005
It doesn't matter. Our job is to look at him

641
00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:07.325
and say, are you pleased with this?

642
00:33:08.605 --> 00:33:10.785
And we be faithful with our assignment.

643
00:33:10.885 --> 00:33:12.585
You be faithful with your assignment.

644
00:33:12.945 --> 00:33:14.065
Whatever gifts and abilities

645
00:33:14.365 --> 00:33:16.745
and opportunities God has entrusted to you

646
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:19.305
with your neighbors, with your workplace, with your skills,

647
00:33:19.495 --> 00:33:22.145
with your financial ability, whatever it is,

648
00:33:22.385 --> 00:33:25.705
whatever God is entrusted to you, you be faithful with that.

649
00:33:25.705 --> 00:33:28.845
And God will bless that. That's the whole goal here.

650
00:33:32.855 --> 00:33:35.315
But if you remember, there was one servant in the parable

651
00:33:35.315 --> 00:33:36.715
who was not faithful, right?

652
00:33:38.695 --> 00:33:40.905
Looking in at Luke 19 verses 20

653
00:33:40.905 --> 00:33:44.225
and 21, this is the third servant.

654
00:33:44.565 --> 00:33:47.345
He came saying, Lord, here is your mana,

655
00:33:47.345 --> 00:33:50.425
which I kept laid away in a handkerchief for.

656
00:33:50.465 --> 00:33:52.665
I was afraid of you because you're a severe man.

657
00:33:53.045 --> 00:33:55.025
You take what you did not deposit you, reap

658
00:33:55.215 --> 00:33:56.545
what you did not sow.

659
00:33:59.095 --> 00:34:02.555
Now remember something before the king left,

660
00:34:03.725 --> 00:34:06.385
he explicitly commanded every one of them

661
00:34:06.765 --> 00:34:09.225
to engage in business until he returned.

662
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:13.905
He said, go invest this minor to all of 'em.

663
00:34:16.655 --> 00:34:18.555
Now think about this. This guy was a rich man.

664
00:34:18.555 --> 00:34:20.395
He was a noble man. He was, he was a businessman.

665
00:34:20.395 --> 00:34:21.595
He knew how this whole thing worked.

666
00:34:21.815 --> 00:34:23.195
So he would've understood

667
00:34:23.585 --> 00:34:25.995
that sometimes the deals don't work out, do they?

668
00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:30.005
Sometimes you invest the one min and you get none back.

669
00:34:30.745 --> 00:34:33.075
Sometimes one gets 10, sometimes one gets five,

670
00:34:33.375 --> 00:34:35.235
but sometimes it's no return.

671
00:34:38.165 --> 00:34:40.705
So really this servant had no way to fail.

672
00:34:42.405 --> 00:34:43.865
No way to fail if you would've just tried.

673
00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:48.235
In fact, that was the only way he could fail, was

674
00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:50.315
to not even try.

675
00:34:53.395 --> 00:34:54.835
I frustrated the king, obviously.

676
00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:57.115
And so he took away the unfaithful servant's minor.

677
00:34:57.545 --> 00:35:00.235
This, this servant was scared that he was gonna lose it.

678
00:35:02.265 --> 00:35:06.665
He lost it. Anyway, listen,

679
00:35:07.175 --> 00:35:09.275
if you never use God's gifts

680
00:35:09.335 --> 00:35:13.765
to serve other people in the church, if you

681
00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:18.005
aren't giving generously with what God has entrusted

682
00:35:18.005 --> 00:35:19.645
to you financially, whether that's a whole lot

683
00:35:19.645 --> 00:35:21.885
or a whole little, it doesn't matter if you're not giving

684
00:35:22.205 --> 00:35:23.725
generously to what he's entrusted you.

685
00:35:25.745 --> 00:35:28.085
If you don't ever talk about Jesus with other people,

686
00:35:30.355 --> 00:35:31.855
you are doing the same thing.

687
00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:33.575
This third servant did.

688
00:35:34.155 --> 00:35:36.735
You're taking the owner's minor

689
00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:38.685
and you're hiding it in a Kleenex.

690
00:35:43.805 --> 00:35:45.145
But, but I'm scared to lose it.

691
00:35:45.185 --> 00:35:47.225
I don't, I don't know if I can, I don't.

692
00:35:47.505 --> 00:35:48.625
I don't know what to do. I don't.

693
00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:49.905
I don't have those gifts that you do.

694
00:35:50.145 --> 00:35:51.705
I, I don't have as much money as they do.

695
00:35:51.905 --> 00:35:53.945
I don't know if I can. I don't really wanna lose it.

696
00:35:54.045 --> 00:35:55.265
I'm gonna mess it up. I know I am.

697
00:35:59.185 --> 00:36:00.575
Again, see it.

698
00:36:00.875 --> 00:36:02.415
If you don't invest,

699
00:36:02.435 --> 00:36:05.215
if you don't even take a step towards investing,

700
00:36:05.475 --> 00:36:08.095
if you don't give an effort towards investing

701
00:36:08.095 --> 00:36:10.375
what God's entrusted to you, you're wasting

702
00:36:10.375 --> 00:36:11.655
what God has entrusted to you.

703
00:36:14.785 --> 00:36:17.365
And he says, bad steward of the kingdom.

704
00:36:21.365 --> 00:36:25.065
And eventually you'll end up losing those gifts.

705
00:36:27.205 --> 00:36:29.385
You can't lose salvation. You're already redeemed.

706
00:36:29.885 --> 00:36:32.465
But what he's entrusted to you that he wants to use,

707
00:36:33.005 --> 00:36:34.945
as two Corinthians five said that,

708
00:36:35.015 --> 00:36:37.905
that we are the vessel he's using to,

709
00:36:37.965 --> 00:36:39.265
to proclaim this message.

710
00:36:39.645 --> 00:36:42.505
You lose the opportunity to be a part of that.

711
00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:51.295
And I know it sounds kinda harsh,

712
00:36:53.035 --> 00:36:56.335
but did you see the underlying urgency in this parable?

713
00:37:00.045 --> 00:37:02.385
Did those servants know when the king would return?

714
00:37:05.115 --> 00:37:08.965
No. They had no idea. And so they had to get

715
00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:11.685
after the work immediately because they,

716
00:37:12.185 --> 00:37:15.005
if they were being good servants, good stewards,

717
00:37:15.075 --> 00:37:16.405
they didn't want to be caught empty

718
00:37:16.405 --> 00:37:17.605
handed when that king returned.

719
00:37:18.795 --> 00:37:20.335
So they're like, we gotta get after this.

720
00:37:20.335 --> 00:37:23.455
We gotta go work to, to invest what he told us to do.

721
00:37:23.455 --> 00:37:24.775
We gotta obey now

722
00:37:26.665 --> 00:37:28.525
and we wanna maximize his return, don't we?

723
00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:29.725
So let's get in. Let's go, go, go.

724
00:37:34.315 --> 00:37:35.485
Your time is coming too.

725
00:37:38.725 --> 00:37:39.975
Your assignment is clear.

726
00:37:41.395 --> 00:37:43.445
Your reward is contingent on how you do that.

727
00:37:43.585 --> 00:37:46.325
And the time is coming soon when you'll be held

728
00:37:46.395 --> 00:37:47.965
accountable for how you did this.

729
00:37:50.465 --> 00:37:52.755
What I will be standing before Jesus

730
00:37:53.135 --> 00:37:56.915
and I will give an account for how I used everything

731
00:37:56.915 --> 00:37:58.435
that he gave me to use.

732
00:38:02.435 --> 00:38:04.695
So many of Jesus' parables are about being ready

733
00:38:04.955 --> 00:38:07.955
for his return, keeping the lamps lit,

734
00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:10.475
staying awake all night, like, be ready

735
00:38:10.545 --> 00:38:11.955
because you don't know when it's coming.

736
00:38:14.655 --> 00:38:17.165
It's similar here that yes,

737
00:38:17.175 --> 00:38:20.565
we've been freed from judgment if we've trusted in Christ

738
00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:23.885
as our savior, but he's calling us to faithfulness until

739
00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:25.685
that kingdom fully comes

740
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.135
being a good steward.

741
00:38:31.645 --> 00:38:34.065
Listen, think about for these people who are hearing this

742
00:38:34.485 --> 00:38:37.165
for us today, to hear this message

743
00:38:37.465 --> 00:38:40.165
of the kingdom is not only a privilege,

744
00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:43.195
it's also responsibility.

745
00:38:46.675 --> 00:38:49.655
And we will be held accountable for what we do with

746
00:38:49.805 --> 00:38:53.495
that kingdom ministry kingdom message

747
00:38:54.755 --> 00:38:56.085
when he returns and what?

748
00:38:56.115 --> 00:38:57.925
What are you gonna do when he comes back?

749
00:39:01.015 --> 00:39:03.195
You're gonna bring your $5 back to the teacher.

750
00:39:06.255 --> 00:39:08.775
I was scared to lose it, scared to mess it up.

751
00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:16.215
Or will you invest all that he's entrusted to you,

752
00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:20.015
uniquely different than me, different than her,

753
00:39:20.015 --> 00:39:22.615
different than him, uniquely what he's given you

754
00:39:23.035 --> 00:39:24.295
to do for his kingdom.

755
00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:27.735
Will you invest that with your whole life, trusting God

756
00:39:27.735 --> 00:39:30.135
to bring the results that's not up to you but you invest.

757
00:39:30.405 --> 00:39:31.775
Will you do that instead?

758
00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:35.955
I love what the old hymn says.

759
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:40.355
Only one life will soon be passed.

760
00:39:41.615 --> 00:39:43.745
Only what's done for Christ will last.

761
00:39:45.285 --> 00:39:48.265
And when I am dying, how happy I'll be.

762
00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:53.775
If the lamp of my life has been burned out for thee,

763
00:39:55.785 --> 00:39:58.405
may that mark us as individuals, as families,

764
00:39:58.425 --> 00:39:59.965
as cgs, as a church.

765
00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:01.125
May that mark us.
