1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.600
for the grace of God offers salvation to

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.300
all people

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.200
teaching us to live Godly life.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.300
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us and

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.200
to purify for himself a people

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.700
that are his very own.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.400
Well, happy Sunday to you Church. It is good to

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.200
see you here. Welcome if you have not been here before

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.500
if I haven't met you yet, please come say hello. My name is John I

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.300
preach most of the time here. And so

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.700
I'd love to meet you. I'm so thankful though for Ryan last

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
week handling the words. So well, one of our elders we're

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.000
grateful for that. It's an honor for me to serve alongside Godly

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.400
Elders. Like we have who hold to the

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200
trustworthy word. We spent the last two

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.700
days on a retreat together and it was a special time just to celebrate that

17
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.400
we're all looking forward to next Sunday

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.600
when we get to celebrate a little bit more as a church family at

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
3pm at our church family meeting. So make sure you're back

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.800
for that. It will be a sweet time there today though.

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.500
We're continuing our Series in Titus called his

22
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.200
very own.

23
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.500
And it's looking at how the gospel changes both our church,

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.900
but also our individual lives because

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.300
we are Gods Everything Changes.

26
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.900
And so go ahead and take your copy of God's word and turn to Titus with

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.100
me again. You can bookmark that for the

28
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.500
next few weeks Titus.

29
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.100
being chapter one

30
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.400
As you're turning there, you might wonder why I have a

31
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.300
weed here on my table.

32
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.900
It's not a decoration. We're not trying to Spruce things up around here. It's

33
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.600
it's an illustration because I want to tell you about what's

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.700
called the world series of weeds.

35
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.300
It is where agriculture students from the US and

36
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.000
Canadian universities compete to identify problems

37
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.100
in farm fields.

38
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
It's actually called the Collegiate weed science contest.

39
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.500
Which tests students' abilities to identify weeds and

40
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.800
the right chemical to kill them.

41
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.700
In fact, the president of the north central weed

42
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.000
science Society.

43
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.100
said this

44
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.300
students need to be able to recognize weeds when

45
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300
they are tiny.

46
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.000
When they get big enough that anybody can recognize them it's too

47
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.500
late to do anything about them.

48
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.000
There was a similar contest going on in Crete

49
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.000
about 2,000 years ago.

50
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.700
But this one had much more serious.

51
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.700
and eternal ramifications

52
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.300
it was the challenge that the Apostle Paul gave to

53
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.000
his Protege Titus.

54
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.300
As Paul understood the back story of the culture

55
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.700
there and create and he was instructing Titus to

56
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.300
a point leaders who could teach God's word?

57
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.900
Yes, but they also if you remember from Titus 1:9

58
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.200
last week, they all so had to be able to

59
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.100
refute error.

60
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.800
They had to be able to recognize and deal with spiritual weeds.

61
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.100
in the church

62
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.200
now since this series is based around the idea that we are

63
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.300
God's very own.

64
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.600
How we're going to think about this today is is we

65
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.300
think about the church as God's Garden.

66
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.200
And we are his plants making up

67
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.700
that Garden.

68
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.100
well, since the garden is his

69
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.200
and since he says throughout scripture, that

70
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.100
weeds are bad.

71
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.300
Just like in your garden at home. We must get rid of

72
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.000
the weeds.

73
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.300
That's the point today get rid of the weeds. It's his his garden.

74
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.300
So we must get rid of

75
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.800
the weeds.

76
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.000
Now primarily, this is a call to church leadership because

77
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.700
we're coming right off the passage on elders and verses 5

78
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.200
through 9. We're coming right into this from there. But this

79
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.300
is also a call for all of us to be aware of

80
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.500
false teachings.

81
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.100
Why is that important?

82
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200
Why was he saying that to them because it was

83
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.900
present it was there false teaching was there. We'll

84
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.200
see it.

85
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.600
In the Gospel of Jesus must be upheld defended.

86
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.800
That's why this is really important.

87
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.600
For the church, but also for you and me.

88
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.200
And so this passage will show us how Titus was to

89
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.500
identify false teachers in Crete.

90
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.500
But also what he was supposed to do with it.

91
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.300
What did they need to do about it?

92
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.400
And this will be instructive for us today as a church as

93
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.500
well.

94
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.200
So look at verses 10 through 16.

95
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.400
Titus 1

96
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.500
Starts with the word four which means it ties and links

97
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.400
back to what he just said. So that's why we tie this with verses 5

98
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.200
through 9 for there are many who are

99
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.800
insubordinate empty talkers and deceivers,

100
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.400
especially those of the circumcision party.

101
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.900
They must be silenced.

102
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.200
since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for

103
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.300
shameful gain what they ought not to teach

104
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.500
one of the cretans that someone from Crete a prophet

105
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.300
of their own said cretans are always

106
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.300
Liars evil beasts lazy gluttons.

107
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.900
And this testimony is true.

108
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.200
Therefore rebuke them sharply that they

109
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.500
may be sound in the faith not devoting themselves to

110
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.400
Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away

111
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.200
from the truth.

112
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.800
To the pure all things are pure but to the defiled and

113
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.800
unbelieving. Nothing is pure.

114
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.200
Both their minds and their consciences are defiled.

115
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.200
They profess to know God, but they

116
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.100
deny him by their works.

117
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.400
They are detestable disobedient unfit for

118
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.500
any good work.

119
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.500
God help us with this passage.

120
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.200
We need you to show us what it

121
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.300
means for us today how you want to

122
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.500
take this scene and Crete

123
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.300
and and apply it to our lives our church

124
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.700
our society.

125
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.000
help us have

126
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.200
soft Hearts to receive what you would have us

127
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.900
receive convict us challenge us where we need it.

128
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.700
That we may be doers of the word not hearers only.

129
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.300
In Jesus name we pray.

130
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.500
amen

131
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.100
Okay. So here's the first question that comes from this passage who

132
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.700
are the weeds.

133
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.600
Like who was he talking about who are the weeds here?

134
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600
We need to know right so you can check yourself.

135
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.800
But then also you can be aware and identify others.

136
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.600
Now, let me make an important distinction here before we get too far down the

137
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.900
road.

138
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.300
When I say weeds.

139
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.100
I'm not talking about unbelievers out in

140
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.200
the world.

141
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.000
Even as yes, we're supposed to avoid false beliefs

142
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.600
that come in from the outside will get to that but but we

143
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.200
are not charged with uprooting unbelievers out

144
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.500
there.

145
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.000
Nor are we charged with going on offense against

146
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.200
people who believe differently than we do out there.

147
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.400
That's not what we're talking about here. The way I'm using weeds today

148
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.800
is how the passage uses that concept.

149
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.000
Those who are within the church.

150
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.400
Who claim to be believers?

151
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.200
But are teaching falsehood?

152
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.700
People who claim to be Christians but teach completely contrary

153
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.600
to what God's word says.

154
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.700
So that's that's the context of weeds today. That's who

155
00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.400
these people are.

156
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.800
Okay, but again, how do we know how do we know who they are?

157
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.600
Well notice if you were here last week, you can read ahead read

158
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.200
back up into the verses 5 through 9 ahead of

159
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.500
this. But but notice how these these weeds have

160
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.800
often very different often opposite characteristics

161
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.500
to what we saw about elders.

162
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.100
What Elders are supposed to be about in the church? That was

163
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.600
very positive.

164
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.500
Here we see weeds are insubordinate.

165
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.300
meaning willfully rebellious against Authority

166
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.600
Paul uses the phrase empty talkers

167
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.300
He looked that up in the original language. The word is actually windbags.

168
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.000
Like blowhards, you know, like he's got to be they're just speaking. Nothing

169
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.500
now doesn't mean they're in articulate because they're probably

170
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.400
really easy to listen to

171
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.800
like there's a reason people will actually pay attention to them these this

172
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.700
phrase. These words are are void of

173
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.400
any biblical content.

174
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.900
Any truth behind them?

175
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.300
It's what Paul references over in second Timothy 4:3 the

176
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.900
ear tickling that will happen where people will accumulate for

177
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.500
themselves teachers to suit their own passions.

178
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.400
Like what I want to hear tell me what I want to hear more about that.

179
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:13.800
Yes.

180
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.300
This is empty talk.

181
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.000
Even further he says these weeds are preaching a different gospel.

182
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.500
That's what he says. This circumcision party is in verse

183
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.800
10. He's he's so called judaizers.

184
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.700
Who are adding the law back onto

185
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.200
the gospel for salvation?

186
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.300
Essentially they were teaching that Christ's sacrifice was not enough.

187
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.900
You need to do this you need to do this you need to do this.

188
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.200
That Grace is not what saves you

189
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.200
it's Grace plus it's it's not only Grace.

190
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.300
It's a false gospel. But going on these false teachers. It says verse

191
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.000
11 had selfish motives.

192
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.800
They were looking for shameful gain.

193
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.000
Some of your translations might say filthy lucre.

194
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.400
It's the old King James would say that.

195
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.700
Now I want to clarify just because a pastor is paid does not

196
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.000
make them a false teacher because I'm out, right?

197
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.900
but but the reality is

198
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.500
in first Timothy 5 Paul says Christian workers

199
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.600
should be paid the difference is that

200
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.200
this group of people these weeds these

201
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.000
weedy teachers were seeking to

202
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.300
profit off of Ministry. They were only doing

203
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.400
it if you would pay them.

204
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.300
No, y'all pray for you. If you 20 bucks in my

205
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.100
pocket, you know, like that's what was happening here. They were just wanting more

206
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.100
and more and more for themselves. It was shameful gain.

207
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.900
off of the ministry

208
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.300
instead of being content with just benefiting people glorifying God.

209
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.900
Willing to do the ministry like we saw from from verse 7

210
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.800
above willing to do the ministry without even

211
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.500
getting paid.

212
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.800
like a proper Elder would

213
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.500
That's the difference.

214
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.600
So Paul was not holding back here.

215
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.400
He was clearly identifying these people but he he twists the

216
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.400
knife a little bit more in verse 12, and he references their own

217
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.000
poet to defend his argument.

218
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.300
Right. You see that look at verse 12. He says one of the cretans a

219
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.000
prophet of their own meaning one of

220
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.800
their own prophets from Crete said cretans are

221
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.800
always Liars evil beasts lazy

222
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.000
gluttons. One thing to be

223
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.600
known as right.

224
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.100
Yes with your own people are saying about you.

225
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.800
Now Paul was probably referring to it's kind of vague but probably epimenides

226
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.000
of Crete from about 600

227
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.000
years earlier from when this was in this

228
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.700
man was talking about the people from Crete.

229
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.900
Just kind of making a blanket generic statement.

230
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.700
Well, we see here that his ancient forecast came true.

231
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.200
because these false teachers

232
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.500
these cretan weeds were teaching a religious

233
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.200
lie.

234
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.000
And they were allowing uncontrolled sinful behavior

235
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.400
in the church.

236
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.900
They were what he says they were.

237
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.100
So Titus think about this Titus was a pastor ministering

238
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.900
in a very difficult Place, wasn't he?

239
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.200
Not only did he have pagans outside the church who were

240
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.400
believing mythologies like Zeus was born on

241
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.000
Crete and like that was part of their mythology, but

242
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.400
he also faced this false gospel

243
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.500
within the church.

244
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.800
But do we not see similar things happening even today?

245
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.100
And we have colts around our society. Of

246
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.600
course, that would be true here. But even many churches we see

247
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.800
drifting towards this.

248
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.000
see false teachers

249
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.600
pridefully drawing attention away from the gospel onto

250
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.200
themselves.

251
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.200
You see false teachers commanding one thing and

252
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.400
yet living out a whole opposite thing.

253
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.600
You see false teachers causing disputes on

254
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:21.900
purpose.

255
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.300
in the church

256
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.600
You see false teachers following their own lust and

257
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.400
sensuality and living out all of

258
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.500
these fantasies.

259
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.600
abusing people

260
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.300
living sinful lifestyle scripture says you will

261
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.000
know them by their fruits.

262
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.800
verse 16

263
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.300
they profess to know God, but they deny him

264
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.400
by their Works. They are detestable disobedient unfit for

265
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.800
any good works.

266
00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.300
Now I get all week to study this stuff.

267
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.700
You're hearing it for the first time. But as I'm sitting here studying this all

268
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.000
week. I kept coming back to this question.

269
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.400
Like how does the church ever get there?

270
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.900
How do these people become leaders within the church like

271
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.800
you should be able to see that stuff. How does this

272
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.200
happen?

273
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.600
Well, here's the thing about it.

274
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.500
You might seem like these people be very obvious on the surface.

275
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.500
They can often hide for a long time and

276
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.600
unassuming places.

277
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.800
Remember when you took driver's ed?

278
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.900
One of the first things you're taught to do is to check your blind spot, right?

279
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.000
Because there's something there that there might be

280
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.000
something there. You can't see.

281
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.200
And if you don't look intentionally, you might

282
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.800
miss it.

283
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.200
We should do that in life, right?

284
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.800
We should do that in the church, too.

285
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.500
In fact, it's what first John 4:1 says says do

286
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.700
not believe every Spirit but test the spirits to

287
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.100
see whether they're from God.

288
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.000
For many false prophets have gone out into the world.

289
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.300
There's a lot of stuff that we need to be testing. Okay. So how do

290
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.300
we do that? If we're supposed to test how do we do that? Well, first and foremost

291
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.300
you do it the way acts 17 10 11

292
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.000
shows us.

293
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.300
That the church immediately sent Paul and Silas Away

294
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.300
by night to Berea and when they arrived they

295
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.600
went into the Jewish synagogue. Now, here's the verse 11

296
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.500
now these Jews in Berea were more noble than

297
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.200
those in thessalonica another city.

298
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.500
For these ones in Berea. They received the word

299
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.900
with all eagerness.

300
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.300
Examining the Scriptures Daily to see if

301
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.400
these things were so

302
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.600
So see that.

303
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.000
They were checking Paul.

304
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.100
Like the Apostle Paul they were checking in like let me

305
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.200
see what he said. Okay, I'm gonna check it here Rita. Yeah. Okay. That

306
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.700
makes sense. They were checking Paul. So hear me clearly hear me

307
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.900
say you ought to check me.

308
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.200
You want to check your CG leader? You

309
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.500
ought to check your Bible study leader. You want to check your Mentor. You

310
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.500
got to check everybody even in the church. You need to be aware.

311
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.600
According to God's word doesn't match.

312
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.100
and

313
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.300
you also ought to take to test any other

314
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.800
teacher you hear out there.

315
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.700
Because it's often very subtle.

316
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.500
Sounds decent.

317
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.100
smooth

318
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.800
give me a couple examples.

319
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.100
Like you hear someone teaching.

320
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.600
That your pit will lead to your promotion.

321
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.900
Your setback will lead to your setup.

322
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.400
Your breakdown will lead to your breakthrough man. That sounds

323
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.000
good. That preach is really well, right.

324
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.800
beware

325
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.000
Beware because that might have been true for Joseph in Genesis

326
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.400
50.

327
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.300
It wasn't true for Paul.

328
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.400
Because Paul his pit led to get in his head cut off, right

329
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.100
so it wasn't leaning his break now eventually we know

330
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.300
theologically after death. Yes, but but in life is

331
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.800
what that whole thing is talking about.

332
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.300
All that's just based on the flesh. Like I want things better for my life.

333
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.400
So, of course this is going to turn into something better. It's health and

334
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.200
wealth Prosperity Gospel or hear about this one.

335
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.300
someone might say

336
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.200
if God really loved you he would

337
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.500
give you.

338
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.600
fill in the blank

339
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.800
or if God really loved you. He surely wouldn't allow that

340
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.000
to happen in your life.

341
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.000
Like do you see like, where is that in

342
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.300
the Bible?

343
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.400
Where does that match up here? Right your conditioning

344
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.600
God that based on what you want or you prefer. That's

345
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.900
the way God works. You see how that that's backwards.

346
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.000
And we could go on and on and on with all kinds of

347
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.100
subtle Little Things.

348
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.400
And listen don't just assume because someone has a big church.

349
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.200
Because someone has a PHD behind their name or because

350
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.500
they have a huge social media following that they're trustworthy.

351
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.800
It's dangerous out there. You've got to test

352
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.200
it according to God's word.

353
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.700
That's why one of our values here is anchoring truth.

354
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.500
Where we prioritize God's word

355
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.700
in everything so we can learn it. We

356
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.300
can know it and we can know how to use

357
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:37.500
it.

358
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.400
Scripture calls. It's the sword of the spirit that this is a tool.

359
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.700
That God has given us in his armor. We

360
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.500
better know how to use it.

361
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.900
And so just like the weeds in your garden, they might begin small

362
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.300
begin subtle.

363
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.500
But ultimately false teachers will make themselves

364
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.400
evident by their words by their actions by

365
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.600
their selfish motives

366
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.600
when you look at someone's life and you see what seems

367
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.500
to be contrary to God's word for leaders, then

368
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.100
you should be aware that something may be off

369
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.300
there.

370
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.700
That's why we must learn to recognize weeds quickly rebuking those

371
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.300
who contradict sound Doctrine within the

372
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:23.600
church.

373
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.900
Now I know what some of you thinking right now.

374
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.200
It sounds pretty harsh.

375
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.400
You guys just going to become the theological gestapo and

376
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.600
start squashing everybody who disagrees with you or doesn't match your exact

377
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.100
theology.

378
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.000
remember

379
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.200
We're not talking about genuine believers. Who

380
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.600
are young in their faith?

381
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.200
Or who are merely misunderstanding something theologically.

382
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.700
Because all of us grow up like that.

383
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.600
Right first Thessalonians. 5:14 says we are to help the

384
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.300
weak and we are to be patient with them all.

385
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.500
It means we're to bring them up in their faith. We're

386
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.300
to help them grow up into maturity.

387
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.500
And if someone's a genuine believer, they'll receive that

388
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.800
correction. Well,

389
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.400
And they'll want to know more they'll want to grow up

390
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.500
in their faith. They'll want to understand better. That's that's part

391
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.400
of the holy spirit inside of you longing for growth that's going to

392
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.300
work and so hear me don't be afraid to

393
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:35.700
ask questions.

394
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.500
Don't hear this and say well, I can't be wrong. Don't

395
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.600
ask me don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be

396
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.400
afraid to sit down with leaders study through God's

397
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.700
word. We are more than happy to walk through God's

398
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.800
word and how to understand it with anybody.

399
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.200
We don't want anyone to feel like they are

400
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.300
excluded because they don't know enough.

401
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.600
what we're talking about here in Titus 1

402
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.200
Is false teachers who know what

403
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.600
they're doing?

404
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.600
Who are unrepentant in it?

405
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.600
More or less they know exactly what they're doing yet.

406
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.400
They will not turn from it.

407
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.400
So we're not being too harsh here.

408
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.800
In this we're protecting the flock.

409
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.700
Because think about it that wolf in sheep's clothing is

410
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.900
not there just to hang out.

411
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.300
It's not there for the good of the Sheep.

412
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.700
That wolf in sheep's clothing is there to destroy a

413
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.700
sheep or the flock?

414
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.600
This is not too harsh. This is

415
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.700
part of the role of shepherds in

416
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.100
the church. It's to protect.

417
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.600
And we also should protect each other.

418
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.600
And so again, that's the second question. Why must we get rid of these weeds?

419
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.400
Why must we as verse 11 says

420
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.400
the word is actually muzzle them like a dog

421
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.700
close their mouth. Why must we silence muzzle

422
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.500
them? Why must we rebuke them sharply verse

423
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.400
13 says why is this so important?

424
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.300
Well just alluded to it what Paul says first is

425
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.700
that they will destroy people.

426
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.200
We must get rid of the weeds because they will destroy people.

427
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.100
Look again at verse 11. They must be silenced muzzled

428
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.300
since they are upsetting whole

429
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.100
families by teaching for shameful game what they

430
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:43.900
ought not to teach

431
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.200
So what they're doing is they're traveling around and they're trying to get

432
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.500
these little pockets of people within the church and they're

433
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.800
they're turning either some or all of a household to

434
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.800
wrong Doctrine or wrong behavior. And that

435
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.400
was thoroughly disrupting the unity of

436
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.500
not only the family but it was drifting over into the

437
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.600
unity of the church.

438
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.600
They were upsetting and destroying whole

439
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.100
families and it was catching unsuspecting

440
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.700
people within the church as well.

441
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.500
Some of you remember may remember back in 2002.

442
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.100
when an out of control barge ran into the bridge

443
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.400
columns holding up I-40 over, Arkansas River in Eastern,

444
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.700
Oklahoma

445
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.700
and as that bridge collapsed

446
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.300
the cars and trucks who were cresting the hill

447
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.600
on I-40 never even saw it coming.

448
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:40.700
and and they

449
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.600
they were dozens of lives permanently changed

450
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.300
because nobody even saw it

451
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:47.700
coming.

452
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.100
Listen, you must be aware of things when they're

453
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.600
going off track.

454
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.800
Either in Doctrine or relationships or

455
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.200
attitudes and we must

456
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.300
be prepared to correct it openly.

457
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.400
If we don't things will begin to fall apart and people

458
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.500
will be hurt.

459
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.300
Our pastor in seminary used to say it

460
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.700
this way if you don't take out the trash every

461
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.500
day, eventually it will take you out.

462
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.200
If we can't get off track so first it will

463
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.300
destroy people if we allow weeds to flour a

464
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.800
second we get rid of the weeds because they dilute the church.

465
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.400
They dilute the church.

466
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.100
Verse 10 shows us apparently in Crete there were many who opposed

467
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.700
the sound doctrine of the Gospel that

468
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.000
Paul entitus were teaching.

469
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.500
That word sound in verse 10 is a medical term implying

470
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:52.800
health.

471
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.400
And so he's saying that that the the sound Doctrine

472
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.200
was a healthy interpretation of

473
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.200
the Gospel that Paul and Titus were proclaiming in Crete in

474
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.600
contrast though. Paul describes the

475
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.100
false teachers impure sick teachings

476
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.600
that they're portraying.

477
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.600
He says in verse 14 they devoted themselves to Jewish myths.

478
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.300
Which was an inordinate focus on Old Testament genealogies

479
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.600
and ritual purity.

480
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.200
He also says they command they devoted themselves to the commands of

481
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.500
men.

482
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.600
Again, things are added on top of God's revelation.

483
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.000
Which is something that Isaiah predicted back in Isaiah 29:13

484
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.500
these people draw near with their mouth and

485
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.400
honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far

486
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.600
from me and their fear of me as a commandment taught

487
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.200
by men.

488
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.600
Something Jesus reiterated in Mark 7:7 he said in vain

489
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.800
do they worship me teaching as doctrines the

490
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.000
Commandments of men.

491
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.800
What he's referring to there probably is the talmud.

492
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.500
Which were the 613 additional commands the

493
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.900
Jews instilled around the law had enough

494
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.300
commands in it. It was only adding the burdens on

495
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.200
top for people to carry it and they were using it inappropriately to

496
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.400
make sure that people felt like they

497
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.300
needed to do more.

498
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.000
And that was a problem.

499
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.800
Because the gospel is good news that

500
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.500
proclaims salvation by grace.

501
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.900
Not through following rules, not through following regulations. And

502
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.000
so they're teaching a different gospel.

503
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.900
than the one that they

504
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.700
heard originally

505
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.700
That's why for us as a church. We are anchored to

506
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.700
sound Biblical teaching to the gospel.

507
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.100
We're anchored to it as a

508
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.300
church, but it also hear me must be true for you as an individual.

509
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.500
The only way that you will know falsehood in your life is

510
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.600
by knowing God's word itself.

511
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.900
And knowing God's word yourself.

512
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.200
That's why you must dive in you must study. If

513
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.500
you need help with that will help you please ask but even

514
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.900
more than Coca Cola you got to know the real thing, baby.

515
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.100
Right, you got to know like that's how that's how they figure out

516
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.300
false money like counterfeit money. Right you you know the

517
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.600
real thing so well that you know, when there's a false

518
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.100
Bill circulating around right? Like you can

519
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.300
see this so much, you know, it's so deeply you can

520
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.500
immediately recognize when there's a fake.

521
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.900
That's the point of what he's saying here.

522
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.400
It dilutes the church. So we've got to know the truth

523
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.900
so we can hear and know when things are off.

524
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.000
But there's one more reason.

525
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.300
To get rid of these weeds.

526
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.400
From God's Garden. It's because they prove themselves not to

527
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.600
be Believers at all. They deceive themselves.

528
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.600
Get rid of the weeds because they deceive themselves that

529
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.500
they're even believers.

530
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.300
You see it in verses 15 and 16 again right to the

531
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.200
pure all things are pure meaning to the the Believers have been washed

532
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.300
all things are pure but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing

533
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.000
is pure.

534
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.700
Both their minds and their consciences are defiled. They're

535
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.300
still dirty.

536
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.100
They profess to know God, but they deny him by

537
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:28.600
their works.

538
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.200
They're detestable disobedient unfit for any

539
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:32.700
good work.

540
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.700
Paul's again referencing Mark 7 Jesus talking about a ceremonial

541
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.100
purification for a Jew and

542
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.200
and washing hands and all the things that they would do with

543
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.400
that. But in that passage Jesus teaches that it is actually

544
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.800
the heart that makes you unclean

545
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.600
Not what comes from the outside it's what comes

546
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.500
from the inside. That means you can wash your

547
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.200
body all you want. You can do all the rituals all you want. But

548
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.400
what you need is to be cleansed From the Inside Out you

549
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.700
need to be made pure you need to be made undefiled as

550
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.200
he just said here.

551
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.300
Something you cannot do on your own.

552
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.400
That's why the person who is seeking Purity before God by

553
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.700
obeying a list of man's rules turns

554
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.000
out not to be one of God's people at all.

555
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.400
Turns out to be an unbeliever.

556
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.400
That's what he says here.

557
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.800
If you're trying to do these things and saying your believer, it's not there because

558
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.500
this this verse 16 actually becomes the

559
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.100
hinge point of the entire letter here.

560
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.400
Where it it summarizes how

561
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.700
these unbelievers are living.

562
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.400
That their counterfeit they're worthless and it's the pivot

563
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.400
because from this point forward the rest of the letter will

564
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.500
reveal. What being God's possession

565
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.100
actually does in someone's life.

566
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.200
All of chapter 2 chapter 3 will show us

567
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.200
if you are his own this is

568
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.800
what it looks like.

569
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.400
It's the lifestyle that chapter 2 verse 1 says

570
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.700
Accords with sound Doctrine.

571
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.900
Like you teach the the healthy interpretation the

572
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.500
pure scripture. This is what lifestyle would

573
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.400
produce from that.

574
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600
Because hear me again.

575
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.900
Merely claiming you're a Christian is not enough.

576
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.300
Our Lives must give evidence

577
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:35.800
of faith

578
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.500
evidence that the gospel has changed us from the

579
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.500
inside out toward obedience.

580
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.600
I'm not telling you anything scripture doesn't say first John 2:4

581
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.900
says whoever says I know him.

582
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.500
But does not keep his Commandments is a

583
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:54.600
liar.

584
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.200
And the truth is not in him.

585
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.500
Part of the deal. This is what it means. It's been said this way. There are

586
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.200
thousands of people who are experts on Christianity who

587
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.600
never seemed to practice it.

588
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.500
Now here's here's the caution as I say all of that.

589
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.900
Seen in so many lives even my own life. I've seen this.

590
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.700
the danger in this moment

591
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.700
when we say things like well, it's about a lifestyle

592
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.700
in responsible when we say things like that. It's it's really easy in this

593
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.500
time to downshift From Grace into legalism.

594
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.800
Where you walk away from this?

595
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.800
Feeling like you have to try harder.

596
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.700
You've got to be better.

597
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.700
So that God will love you.

598
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.000
Man, I'm blowing in I'm messing up. God doesn't love me.

599
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.300
And you hear this you kind of feel this subtle

600
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.200
like Challenge and go do more and be better in front of that. So

601
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.200
the lord loves you, but you already know you can't.

602
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.200
Necessary discouraged already and you're walking away think well,

603
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.400
I guess God's Never Gonna Love Me.

604
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.500
That's why we cannot forget that the

605
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.800
good works. We're talking about here. The lifestyle we're

606
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.200
talking about here is a response to

607
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.300
Salvation.

608
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.900
That the good works of Our Lives depend on God's

609
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.900
work in us his power in

610
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.600
US. It depends on Christ's finished

611
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.500
work for us.

612
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.300
We're not saying anything about earning it. We are talking about

613
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.600
responding to it.

614
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.400
Now we'll be perfect in that response. No.

615
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.600
But True Believers

616
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.700
Will seek to live in obedience

617
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.100
and Purity and they'll walk

618
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.500
in Repentance when they fail at it.

619
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.800
A few years ago if you were planning to vacation in Zambia.

620
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.600
You had to be aware of the street corner Emerald vendors.

621
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.100
And if you were driving in Zambia, you had to be

622
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.800
prepared for some confusion in the streets owing to

623
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.100
stolen traffic lights.

624
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.100
Surprisingly the two problems were related.

625
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.700
The traffic light thieves were selling

626
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.300
green glass chips to unsuspecting

627
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.200
tourists who thought they were getting

628
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.000
Bargain Basement emeralds.

629
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.800
Listen, there are a lot of Bargain Basement

630
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.700
gospels floating around out there.

631
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.700
other falsehoods

632
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.500
just being peddled like it's

633
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:52.600
nothing

634
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.700
even on the bookshelves in our houses.

635
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.300
And on our Instagram feeds every day.

636
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.800
Scripture teaches you might have heard of this before scripture

637
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.400
teaches that many cowbirds.

638
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.300
Will rise up in the future and try to

639
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.000
push out the gospel egg from the church's nest

640
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.300
and replace it with their egg full of

641
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.700
lies.

642
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.800
heard those birds that do that

643
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.000
Right, they they take somebody else's nest with a good egg in it.

644
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.400
They shove it out of there and they put their own egg in it. They just don't want to build a nest.

645
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.300
That's what is happening all over and it's only

646
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.200
going to happen more. So as we go forward, that's why we must

647
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.200
learn to recognize what the weeds are when they're tiny.

648
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.600
You must choose to listen to people who

649
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.200
are putting you in positions to

650
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.900
hear and be pointed to the Gospel of Jesus Christ his

651
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.300
life death and Resurrection in your place. If it

652
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.100
doesn't have that don't listen to it.

653
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.600
And we must have the courage to firmly deal with false teachings

654
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.200
both as a church, but also you and

655
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.400
your own life to say no. I'm not going to listen to that anymore.

656
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.900
And that's for the sake of the gospel for the health of the church primarily. Yes

657
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.500
as we confront, but there's a side benefit here.

658
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.400
We're about that first and foremost. There's a side benefit though verse

659
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.400
13 says there is a chance that these false teachers

660
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.000
might actually be restored to spiritual health.

661
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.100
As they are confronted.

662
00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:34.800
even they

663
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.700
might be brought to repentance.

664
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.800
Teaching falsehood teaching false gospels.

665
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.300
They might even be brought to

666
00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.900
prevents. That's how powerful this true gospel actually

667
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.600
is. See God can take any of us

668
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.800
right where we are and lead us to eternal

669
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.100
life when we repent and believe in Jesus Christ.

670
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.800
Whether that's from you teaching false gospels

671
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.400
or whether that's you and your secret addiction or whether

672
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.900
that's you in whatever you have if we turn

673
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.400
away from that and we turn to him

674
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.200
in faith.

675
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:13.900
He redeems us.

676
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.400
That's what he does for you believer.

677
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.900
rejoice in that

678
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.100
but also see the offer that's what he can do

679
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.300
for you, unbeliever.

680
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.500
May the Lord do more of that in us and through us this year

681
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.300
than ever before.
