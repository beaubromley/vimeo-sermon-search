00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.800
here

2
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.200
One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat

3
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.500
with him.

4
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.500
He went into the Pharisees house and reclined at

5
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.700
table.

6
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.300
And behold a woman of the city who was

7
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.900
a sinner.

8
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.300
When she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisees house

9
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.600
brought in Alabaster flask of ointment perfume.

10
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
Standing behind him at his feet weeping. She

11
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.500
began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped

12
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.300
them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet

13
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.200
and anointed them with the ointment.

14
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.900
Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said

15
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.600
to himself if this man were a prophet

16
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
He would have known who and what sort of woman this

17
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.000
is who is touching him?

18
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.200
For she is a sinner.

19
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.600
Now if you were there at that dinner.

20
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.200
Watching this unfold how would you have responded?

21
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.700
Now it might be easy for us 2,000 years later to

22
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.900
sit back and condemnation over this Pharisee.

23
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.400
This Jewish religious leader that what he

24
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.400
was muttering to himself like many so judgmental and we look

25
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.300
at that from this side, but don't be too quick to cast the

26
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.800
first stone.

27
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.700
Because this man would not have been alone in that judgment.

28
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.100
Others would have thought the same thing.

29
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.200
Right because because prophets and Priests and

30
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.400
other leaders at that time. They had a lawful requirement to

31
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.000
separate from sinners.

32
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.200
To avoid becoming unclean so that

33
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
they could enter into the temple to worship.

34
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.300
Like this was just part of the deal.

35
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.100
And women like this.

36
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.100
Were perpetually unclean.

37
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.700
That's why he thinks what he thinks.

38
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.300
And it's how most if not all of the religious leaders at

39
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.300
that time would have thought focused on the law

40
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.700
the Holiness codes and and the cleanliness side of

41
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.800
life. They were focused so much.

42
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.100
But Jesus was different.

43
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.400
We see that all over the gospels the way he treated

44
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.700
people.

45
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.600
The way he healed people.

46
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.200
The way he went about proclaiming the good news of

47
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.600
God's kingdom coming.

48
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.700
But also as we'll see today.

49
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.600
the way Jesus forgave big sinners

50
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.100
He was different the way he forgave big

51
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.300
Sinners. That's the point today

52
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.500
that Jesus forgave big Sinners. I know it sounds over simplified.

53
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.100
Just wait it out. You'll you'll see some things. I think

54
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.600
you might not have seen before.

55
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.000
Because remember The Parables revealed to us the the backwards

56
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.100
nature of God's kingdom compared to the way of the

57
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.200
world.

58
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400
That things are different in God's kingdom. They

59
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.400
show us the values and the Heart of the king first and his

60
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.900
kingdom.

61
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.100
Including this parable of the two debtors that we

62
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.500
will find in Luke 7.

63
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.800
So take your copy of God's word and turn there with me to Luke chapter 7

64
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.400
again all summer in the parables in

65
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.300
Luke Luke 7 is where we'll find this one.

66
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.200
Already read verses 36 to 39 at the

67
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.600
start which gives us the context of this scene

68
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.400
that Jesus had been invited into this Pharisees house for a meal.

69
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.700
That's where this woman found Jesus. They

70
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.400
she'd heard he was there and she was so moved by

71
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.900
being with him by being near him that that she

72
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.400
was she was doing what she did there.

73
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.500
This woman remember that that Luke makes it a point to mention

74
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.200
twice than in people's eyes. She was a sinner.

75
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.300
So people perceived her.

76
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.200
This woman was that Jesus's feet.

77
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.300
Notice not even in front of him, but behind him

78
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.400
she was so broken and low. She would just crawled

79
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.000
up behind his feet.

80
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.100
And then you have this this Pharisee over in the corner.

81
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.300
Just you can just see him right sitting back. Just muttering.

82
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.800
judging

83
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.400
both Jesus and the woman

84
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.000
now verse 40

85
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.000
look at it says Jesus answering now remember?

86
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.600
This guy was talking to himself, right?

87
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.600
So Jesus reads his mind. First of all, that's kind of scary first as

88
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.200
you're imagining judging someone in Jesus

89
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.500
says hey, hey Simon, right, so he read

90
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.000
the guy's Minds at Simon. I have something to say to you.

91
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.100
And so Simon answered say it teacher.

92
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.100
In other words Simon I know what you're thinking man.

93
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.900
Someone teach you a lesson.

94
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.700
And so in response to the whole scene here at this

95
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.200
meal where the woman is weeping and

96
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.700
anointing his feet the Pharisees over here judging Jesus

97
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.400
tells the parable of the

98
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400
two debtors.

99
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.900
Look at verses 41 through 43.

100
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.100
Certain money lender had two debtors.

101
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.700
one owed 500 Denari the

102
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.400
other 50

103
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.300
when they could not pay he canceled the debt of

104
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.700
both.

105
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.600
Now which of them will love him more?

106
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.200
And Simon answered the one I suppose for whom

107
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.800
he canceled the larger debt.

108
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.900
And Jesus said to him you have judged rightly.

109
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.300
Now it seems simple but we need to understand what Jesus

110
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.600
was teaching here, right?

111
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.500
We need to understand the point of Jesus's parable.

112
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.400
We need to get this in our minds understand it.

113
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.500
And so to get there we need to First understand. What a

114
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.000
Denarius was.

115
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.400
Because that's the standard of measure that Jesus is using here

116
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.700
in this Parable. So what was a Denarius a Denarius

117
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.900
was one day's wage for a common day

118
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.100
labor.

119
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.400
So I just somebody just go into work the fields a day worker.

120
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.100
That was one day's wage. They'd get a Denarius.

121
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.900
So to help us understand, I have a engineering degree.

122
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.100
So I like math in my head. I love this.

123
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.600
So I did a little math to compare our dollars today

124
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.300
to what that would have been back then so a day

125
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.600
labor, let's just assume $10 an hour for ease of math

126
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.500
and and then they work eight hours a day.

127
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.800
If you take all of that together, the first debtor

128
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.300
in this scene would have owed them lender $40,000.

129
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.400
Well, the second debtor would have owed $4,000

130
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.300
right 550 40,000 to

131
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.300
4,000. These were

132
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.300
the two debts that these people could not pay back

133
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.200
to the lender for whatever reason they couldn't pay it back

134
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.400
and that's why the parable here shows us the heart of the

135
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.200
king of the kingdom of God.

136
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.600
Right because Jesus looked at the scandalous

137
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.800
woman at his feet. He looked at Simon over

138
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.900
here self-righteously judging her and him.

139
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.100
Jesus looked at the scene and he gave a picture of

140
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.500
what forgiveness looks like.

141
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.900
So Jesus is telling this Parable and Simon's trapped, right?

142
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.800
He's Trapped In This Moment. He he knows $40,000

143
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.400
$4,000. He knows it's very

144
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.300
clear the answer to the question and he had

145
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.100
to respond to Jesus asking him which one would love

146
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.000
him more by saying, of course the one who had the larger debt forgiven.

147
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.100
They'd feel more grateful.

148
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.700
They'd feel more free. They'd feel more released from

149
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.300
what their their debt was and the weight

150
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.600
of that.

151
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.800
Now here's the reality. They should both feel.

152
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.100
Grateful thankful free because they

153
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.200
had a debt forgiven, right?

154
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.900
But one would comparatively feel more than the

155
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:23.900
other.

156
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.500
And all that sets up.

157
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.800
The public application that Jesus then gives in response

158
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.600
to the parable.

159
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.400
See the context had been clear that the scene was

160
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.600
set. The parable had been powerfully portrayed Jesus

161
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.500
paints a picture in people's minds and now he applied

162
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:45.600
it.

163
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.100
We're grateful that he shows us the meaning.

164
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.400
That's what he continues. Look at verses 44 through 48.

165
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.100
He just told the parable Simon understood it. Then turning

166
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.200
to The Woman verse 44 turning to the woman. He

167
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200
said to Simon so he turns to

168
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.600
the woman, but he's still talking to Simon, right?

169
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.600
He says do you see this woman?

170
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.600
I entered your house Simon you gave me no water

171
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.500
for my feet, but she has wet

172
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.700
my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

173
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.300
You gave me no kiss. But from the time I came

174
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.800
in. She has not ceased to kiss my feet.

175
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.600
You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my

176
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.100
feet with ointment perfume.

177
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.900
Therefore I tell you her sins, which are many are forgiven.

178
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.700
For she loved much.

179
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.500
but he who was forgiven little loves little

180
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.700
and he said to her your sins are

181
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.800
forgiven.

182
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.000
So notice something here.

183
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.600
The whole time Jesus has been in the house. We don't know how long it was. But

184
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.500
but the whole time he had been allowing all of

185
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.200
this to happen.

186
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.700
to set up this contrast between Simon

187
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.200
and the woman

188
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.900
Because remember Simon was not the only one around that table.

189
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.600
there were other people there who were listening and Jesus

190
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.300
Remember uses Parables to separate those who

191
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.600
are looking for the kingdom of God from those who aren't

192
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.500
So here he's immediately separating. We

193
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.700
see that very clear. Look at the next verse verse 49.

194
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.400
Those who were at table meaning around the table with him began to

195
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.700
say among themselves. Who is this who even forgives

196
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.300
sins?

197
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.500
Like they don't know what they're seeing. They can't understand forgiveness

198
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.000
because they're not looking for the kingdom of God.

199
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.300
He used it to separate to get people to see the nature of the

200
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.600
Kingdom if they're looking for it. They're going to love it. But if they're not they're

201
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.900
going to be confused by it.

202
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.400
And here he puts forward this idea of

203
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.200
what we should do how people should respond to the

204
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.000
to their their understanding of

205
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.800
their sin. If they fully get it that they are sinful to

206
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.600
get in the Kingdom. They have this response. But

207
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.700
Simon over here, he doesn't understand his sin.

208
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.900
So he's not going to respond like this.

209
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.900
That's what Jesus is doing when he compared and contrasted

210
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.200
the responses to Jesus between Simon

211
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.800
and between the woman.

212
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.300
And you see that right? He says Simon.

213
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.000
even in your own house

214
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.600
You did not even offer basic measures of

215
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.500
hospitality like water to wash

216
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.500
off the nastiness off of the guest feet.

217
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.100
but this woman

218
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.500
this woman

219
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.400
comes in off the street and she uses her

220
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.500
own tears and her own hair to wash

221
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.500
Jesus's feet.

222
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.500
Like she's humble. She's serving it

223
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.100
sounds a lot like Jesus with his disciples a few

224
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.700
years later, right?

225
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.700
Just on her face with her own resources.

226
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.300
Simon did not even greet Jesus with a kiss on both

227
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.200
cheeks, which was a standard way to greet those that

228
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.500
you respect that you're welcoming into your house those that

229
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.200
you have a sense of acquaintance with

230
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.500
Didn't even do that. But this woman.

231
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.500
She can't even stand up in jesus' presence

232
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.300
because she's so elated to be with him

233
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.800
that she's cherishing even his feet and that that's

234
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.200
kissing them over and over again which which was

235
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.300
both a sign of honor to this man, but also submission to

236
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.900
her Lord.

237
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.400
and savior

238
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.700
Simon did not even anoint jesus' head

239
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.700
with cheap olive oil which was a standard practice

240
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.200
just as a way to serve other

241
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.400
people.

242
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.200
while the woman

243
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.400
anoints even jesus' feet

244
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.700
with the costly perfume, which

245
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.000
was an extravagant effort. Anyway, an

246
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.600
over the top action was something so valuable

247
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.200
even on his feet.

248
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.600
But you think about it all of those contrasts points us

249
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.800
back to the parable, right?

250
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.800
Jesus tells the parable and then shows the contrast.

251
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.900
That like one debtor who'd been forgiven $40,000

252
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.700
would be so much more grateful than

253
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.000
the one who'd been forgiven. $4,000, right?

254
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.800
It's the same here with Simon and the woman.

255
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.500
That's why Jesus said verse 47. Therefore. I tell you her sins,

256
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.500
which are many are forgiven for she loved much.

257
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.500
But he who is Forgiven little?

258
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.400
loves little

259
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.500
Be careful with this verse though because Jesus here

260
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.000
is not teaching some kind of works based

261
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.600
salvation.

262
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.300
That because she loved him so much because she

263
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.500
did all of these things for him

264
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.700
that he turned around and said, oh, yeah now you're saved.

265
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.200
Because you did that you are saved no look down at

266
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200
the end verse 50.

267
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.000
In verse 50. Jesus said to the woman your faith has

268
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.800
saved you go in. Peace.

269
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.500
Your faith has saved you that gives

270
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.200
you peace.

271
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.700
What kind of Peace well first piece with God right?

272
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.800
As an enemy of God now brought into relationship peace

273
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.400
with God peace with herself.

274
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.400
Peace with her past of who she had been

275
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.200
right go in peace that you don't have to be that

276
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:05.600
anymore.

277
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.600
So what Jesus meant then in verse 47 is that though?

278
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.800
She knew she was a big sinner.

279
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.100
She had a bigger savior.

280
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.900
It came to him.

281
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.700
His name was Jesus. And so she loved

282
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.100
him much in response.

283
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.400
Another translation says that her great love

284
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.100
proves that her many sins have been

285
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.700
forgiven.

286
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.400
That's what this means. That's what's her response. But

287
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.200
think here Simon.

288
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.600
Simon on the other hand

289
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.400
He did not really acknowledge his sin, so

290
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.800
he didn't think he needed Jesus.

291
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.300
He might have respected Jesus as a teacher like he

292
00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.800
even says here.

293
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800
But he certainly didn't love him.

294
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.700
He certainly didn't love him like this woman.

295
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.300
But think about it.

296
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.600
think about it could

297
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.500
Simon have been grateful like she

298
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:15.800
was

299
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.200
Yes.

300
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.400
Right, absolutely.

301
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.900
Because remember Simon had a sin debt

302
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.000
that he could not pay back also.

303
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.000
He needed forgiveness just like she did.

304
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.000
He had sin blinding his heart just like she did.

305
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.300
He's guilty too. He could have been just like

306
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:39.600
her.

307
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.600
If he had seen Jesus as the Savior if

308
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.800
he had come to Jesus in that

309
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.500
kind of perspective knowing who he is knowing

310
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.200
who Jesus is then his actions would have been a lot

311
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.900
more like hers.

312
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.200
So I think if you have ears to hear what Jesus is saying

313
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.400
here, I think it's it's pretty simple to get the point of

314
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.900
this powerful parable.

315
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.600
But also want us to dig a layer deeper.

316
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.500
To mine out some of the more particular things that

317
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.300
we might not just glance over here at this

318
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.100
scene.

319
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.200
Because not only do we need to understand what Jesus was teaching them. We need to hear what

320
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.500
he's saying to us today.

321
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.400
Like we need to hear what he's telling

322
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.600
us through this scene 2,000 years ago. What

323
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.400
is he saying to us here in

324
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:39.900
this moment?

325
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.300
What are specific ways this Parable applies

326
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.500
in our lives?

327
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.200
I want to give you three. It's probably more.

328
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.400
But here's three responses as Jesus forgives big

329
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.100
sinners.

330
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.300
Here are three responses.

331
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.900
First we must also

332
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.100
see people deeply.

333
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.700
see people

334
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.600
deeply

335
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.400
see when you read through the gospels Matthew Mark

336
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.100
Luke and John.

337
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.100
You find that if anything was true about Jesus.

338
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.900
It's that he could see people.

339
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.000
Not just look at people.

340
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.700
See people right? There's a difference between those two things.

341
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.200
Let me give you an example. We have the example here, but

342
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.800
let me give you example from Mark chapter 5.

343
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.400
Says a great crowd followed Jesus and thronged about him meaning

344
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.100
pressed in closely and pushed on him and there was

345
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.800
a woman who had a discharge of blood for 12 years who had

346
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.400
suffered much under many Physicians had spent all she

347
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.600
had to try to fix it was no better but rather grew

348
00:19:59.600 --> 00:19:59.900
worse.

349
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.500
She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him

350
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.200
in the crowd and touched His Garment sounds like the woman

351
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.900
in Pharisees house, right?

352
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.400
She touched His Garment for she said if I touch even his

353
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.400
garments, I'll be made well.

354
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:15.900
and immediately

355
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.300
the flow of blood dried up and she felt in her

356
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.700
body. She was healed of her disease.

357
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.200
And Jesus perceiving in

358
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.500
himself that power had gone out from him immediately turned

359
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.400
about in the crowd and said who touched my

360
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.900
garments.

361
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.500
who touched

362
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.300
and his disciples said to him you see the crowd pressing around you yet. You

363
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.100
say who touched me like everybody's touching you

364
00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.400
Jesus?

365
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.600
And he looked around to see who had done it.

366
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.300
But the woman knowing what had happened to or came in fear

367
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.300
and trembling and fell down before him sounds familiar, right?

368
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.600
And told him the whole truth.

369
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.400
And he said to her daughter your faith

370
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.300
has made you well.

371
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.800
Go in peace.

372
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.000
And be healed of your disease.

373
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.400
So again In This Crowd everybody bumping into

374
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.100
each other run like, you know, just this massive people.

375
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.500
Everybody's touching everybody else yet. He

376
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.100
asked the question who singular touched

377
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.100
me.

378
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.000
Who was it who touched me?

379
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.800
So many people around him the crowds yet. He

380
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.000
saw this woman's condition. He saw

381
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.900
her form. He understood her needs

382
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.200
and he met her where she was.

383
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.700
You think he knew she was coming, right Jesus knew

384
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.300
she was going to be there. It wasn't like he was surprised by

385
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.100
something. He knew she was there.

386
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.500
And so the question in light of who Jesus is

387
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.300
the question is, is that where we are, is that

388
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.800
our hearts?

389
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.700
Do we have the same heart Jesus had for people

390
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.700
do we look with compassion? Do we look with empathy?

391
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.200
Are we burdened for the broken for the people

392
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.800
around us?

393
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.300
Do we lock eyes with people who think that they

394
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.800
never get noticed by anybody else?

395
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.300
Do we show Hospitality to

396
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.600
people in ways that hear this actually might

397
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.300
affect our social standing of people around us.

398
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.100
You had them here. What are you doing? Why are you

399
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.100
meeting? Why are you care?

400
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.300
hospitality

401
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.300
welcoming

402
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.100
all people

403
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.500
do we look around and we see people who are different than

404
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:48.800
us.

405
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.300
Respecting them listening to them and

406
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.300
their experiences.

407
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.400
Remember that Jesus here in the headwinds of

408
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.400
cultural and religious norms.

409
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.500
He saw this woman at his

410
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.400
feet not as anything but a person

411
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.900
who needed forgiveness.

412
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.300
Not what everybody else in the room saw her as what the

413
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.100
world saw her as he saw her as a person

414
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.100
who needed forgiveness, but not only person need forgiveness, but

415
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.200
also someone who could carry that Grace of his love and

416
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.000
forgiveness to other people.

417
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.900
Go in peace. He says.

418
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.600
like the woman at the well

419
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.000
Right, go go tell go share.

420
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.600
I've changed your life go tell everybody about it. Listen

421
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.400
church, let we cannot allow.

422
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.500
Our external environments that we walk around

423
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.000
in.

424
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.400
Nor our internal attitudes towards people.

425
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.700
We cannot allow those things to hinder

426
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.300
our ability to see who God wants us

427
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:02.700
to see.

428
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.900
Wherever Whenever we are around others

429
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.200
to see people deeply

430
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.000
But listen, you can only get there.

431
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.500
You can only get to that kind of heart. If you follow here

432
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.200
the second response that you must view your self-humbly.

433
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.900
We look at the parable the context the application. We must

434
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.400
view ourselves humbly.

435
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.400
Think again to the parable.

436
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.700
Right the structure of the parable.

437
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:38.800
Yes.

438
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.300
One of the debtors had a larger debt than the

439
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.000
other person did.

440
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.800
They both had a debt.

441
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:51.700
right

442
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.300
They both had a debt and they both checked this out.

443
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.200
They both had a debt they couldn't pay back.

444
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.200
40,000 4,000 it says both of

445
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.500
them could not pay so the moneylender looks at them and says I forgive both

446
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:06.900
of you.

447
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.800
You couldn't pay I forgave you. So since Jesus then

448
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.300
ties the Parable with forgiveness of sins what

449
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.200
that means for each of us today is that all of us are

450
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.900
debtors to?

451
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.500
Each one of us is in that same category of

452
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.200
a debtor that cannot pay back a debt.

453
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.800
That's us every one of us.

454
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.400
Because on our own We Stand guilty before God.

455
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.100
We have this Romans 3:23 sin debt that we can't

456
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.200
pay back to God all have sinned to fall short of the glory of God. We

457
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.800
can't make it. We can't pay it back.

458
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.200
If we recognize that reality.

459
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.700
And we remember that it's not just about comparing ourselves

460
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.200
to other people so that we think we're comparatively better

461
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.700
than they are.

462
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.300
We're not as bad as we thought we were or somebody else might say we

463
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.200
are no I'm better than no. That's not what it's about either when we recognize what

464
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.300
we really are and then

465
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.900
we acknowledge it and we're willing to come to Jesus and

466
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.400
respond to Jesus.

467
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.500
We can move from the category of debtor that

468
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.000
can't pay it back to forgiven debtor.

469
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.400
Right, you understand that you can make it

470
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.200
to this category from the one category. We're all in.

471
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.300
To be a forgiven debtor.

472
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.900
And so check this out in the parable. There's not actually

473
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.300
a lesser debtor category.

474
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.600
We're all debtors. We're all equally guilty when

475
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.600
we compare ourselves to a holy God.

476
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.100
We all have a debt we cannot pay.

477
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.300
And so when we see God like that as holy when

478
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.200
we see ourselves as not holy as sinful

479
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.400
deserving his wrath what that leads

480
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.900
us then to is to see Jesus as even

481
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.100
more glorious.

482
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.400
When we really remember that that he

483
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.600
would come and live the perfect life that we could never live that Holy

484
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600
life. We could never live. He did it for us. Then he

485
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.500
died the death we deserve for that sin. He came

486
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.400
back from the grave to defeat that sin to defeat

487
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.300
that death. That's the only way to see

488
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.800
that sin debt forgiven.

489
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.300
When we repent of that sin trust in Jesus in our

490
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.400
place, that gives us forgiveness.

491
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.700
And listen that destroys any form of pride

492
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.300
in yourself that you think you could work

493
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.600
it off. You think you could pay it off yourself. You can't

494
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.100
And so it should humble us.

495
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.700
That we needed Jesus to do it for us.

496
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.900
And so it should kill self-righteousness in our hearts.

497
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.900
We should not respond like Simon.

498
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.500
But it also should remove any disdain for

499
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.400
others or any attitude of superiority. We

500
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.800
might have over other people.

501
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.200
Yes Simon disagreed with Jesus that he

502
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.800
didn't think he needed Jesus. But also Simon is looking at this woman like man if

503
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.700
he knew who she was.

504
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.900
And Jesus like do you know who you are, right?

505
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.300
It should kill any attitude of superiority over

506
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.200
other people.

507
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.400
We're all debtors. We're not better than anyone else

508
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.500
in this at all. But that's also one of the most beautiful aspects

509
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.100
of the Gospel.

510
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.300
See the gospel not only takes those of us who

511
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.600
might view ourselves too, highly and it humbles us.

512
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.600
it also takes

513
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.300
you when you feel.

514
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.200
downcast

515
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.500
Cast Away too low it

516
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.300
lifts you up.

517
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:57.700
the woman

518
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.400
didn't deserve anything.

519
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.200
Jesus lifts her up and says Dottie your faith is saved

520
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.800
you go in. Peace.

521
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.300
It humbles us kills self-righteousness, but

522
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.300
also elevates us beyond anything that

523
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.600
we could ever imagine about ourselves.

524
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.400
It's the gospel beautiful picture of taking

525
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.600
debts and forgiving.

526
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.300
Changes the way with you god changes the way we view

527
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.700
ourselves.

528
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.000
And it changes the way we then treat other people.

529
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.100
Not only should we be quicker to forgive if we've been

530
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.900
forgiven so much. We should also stop rejecting those

531
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.600
that the world and even people around us

532
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.300
might consider outcasts due to their sin.

533
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.900
Think about it this

534
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.200
woman Jesus Jesus knew the reputation that woman didn't he?

535
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.200
Everybody else knew.

536
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.200
Woman of the city woman of the night. She's a sinner.

537
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.600
Jesus would have known who she was yet. He

538
00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.600
willingly allowed her to worship him

539
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.000
to honor him to touch him.

540
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.200
As a prophet a priest whatever you

541
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.100
might call up. He's a religious leader and he's supposed to

542
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.000
stay clean, but he allowed her to touch him.

543
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.900
Even as unclean as she was.

544
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.300
And he looked at her and he forgave her and he

545
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:28.800
saved her.

546
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.200
But you might be sitting out there saying oh, but wait a second hold up. You're supposed to

547
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.800
embrace Sinners here. How what about their sin?

548
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.700
Like does does loving the outcast mean that we approve of

549
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.200
what they're doing?

550
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.200
This woman was was living a sinful lifestyle. Do we

551
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.700
approve of this Jesus approving of that? No, Jesus never approved

552
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.700
of those things. Remember acceptance does

553
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.700
not equal approval.

554
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.200
You can I know it's hard to believe the world doesn't

555
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.000
believe this but it's possible to reject specific actions

556
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.700
yet. Still Embrace sinners.

557
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.700
Because think how else will we be able to help people move

558
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.100
toward faith move toward obedience.

559
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.700
Without a relationship with them somehow.

560
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.100
again, not approval, but we can welcome people

561
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.300
like Christ has welcomed us

562
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.300
Romans 15:7

563
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.900
Because think what he does with you.

564
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.800
He loves us unconditionally.

565
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.500
Yet he calls us out of our sin and toward better.

566
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.300
You can do that. You can love someone and be in relationship with them and

567
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.200
still say get out of that stop for your good

568
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.000
for your family's good for others. Good stop.

569
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.000
Christ is better. Let's walk together towards him. It's possible.

570
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.200
But you can't get there.

571
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.900
without starting

572
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.200
humbly viewing yourself

573
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.400
that you're a debt or two that you're you're payment

574
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.000
your end game is eternity

575
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.500
without God.

576
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.700
Unless he intervened.

577
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.600
You are a debtor. I am a

578
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.000
debtor, too.

579
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.400
So let's view ourselves that way to lead us

580
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.400
to view others differently.

581
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.200
And that leads us to the final.

582
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.100
action step

583
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.300
in response to this Parable and context around it.

584
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.500
See the fact that Jesus forgives big Sinners should also lead

585
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.600
us to worship Him boldly.

586
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.600
to worship God boldly

587
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.900
See people deeply view ourselves humbly worship God boldly.

588
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.000
see when we

589
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.600
truly grasp the depth

590
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.800
of forgiveness

591
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.400
that we are each here this

592
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.300
Each an enemy of God in our sin.

593
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.700
That we are each destined to an eternity without him.

594
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.700
Yet he reached through the darkness and

595
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.000
saved us from that pit.

596
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.300
When we get that that makes us truly different, doesn't

597
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:24.500
it?

598
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:27.800
Like there's a woman.

599
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.200
She had obviously heard somehow she heard about

600
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.700
Jesus that that he offered sinners like

601
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.600
her a different life something new and

602
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.900
she responded with overwhelmed Joy,

603
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.200
right?

604
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.500
Like she shed tears all over his

605
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.100
feet.

606
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.200
Because broken in her shame everybody else

607
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.300
told her you're worthless. You're pointless. This is all your

608
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.600
good for you have no hope she was shameful yet.

609
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.300
She was then elated that this man would offer

610
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.000
her forgiveness.

611
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.900
She wasn't afraid what other people thought about her

612
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.900
as she kissed his dirty feet in

613
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.100
honor and submission to our Lord

614
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.500
say

615
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.700
She brought the best she had.

616
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.300
Expensive perfume. She poured it

617
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.400
out in worship to her Lord right there.

618
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.900
Church would anyone describe us?

619
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.900
What have we made our faith all about?

620
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.700
our minds

621
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.600
like Doctrine and complex thoughts and

622
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.700
and we've written emotions completely out

623
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.200
of this thing.

624
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.400
God made us emotional creatures

625
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.600
Now listen, it's right to study and we absolutely should

626
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.200
that's what we do here for 35 minutes every Sunday.

627
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.300
That's what you should do every day. Like we'd get in community groups. We study

628
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.200
God's word. Yes, we should but our study of

629
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.600
God should move our hearts. It should stir

630
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:14.900
us.

631
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.500
Theology study of God theology should

632
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.100
lead to doxology which is worship.

633
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.500
And we're studying the god of the universe.

634
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.400
Like somehow we started believing that we

635
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.500
can receive God's grace without effect and without

636
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.200
response.

637
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.200
Do we really understand Grace then if we if we

638
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.200
don't feel anything if we're not moved by it in

639
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.400
any way Grace Grace should lead us

640
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.700
to more humility.

641
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.900
to more grateful hearts

642
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.700
to more compassion

643
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.300
for other people

644
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.200
to more bold proclamation of the Gospel to all people

645
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.100
groups to our neighbors.

646
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.000
So why?

647
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.200
Is our response to God so often

648
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.800
lukewarm.

649
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.900
Why are we so calloused so oft?

650
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.400
Why do we often respond to Jesus like Simon

651
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.500
not like the woman?

652
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.300
Why do we just go through the motion In

653
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.600
Worship?

654
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.300
Why does this feel so often

655
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.700
so ritualistic?

656
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.600
Why are we stone-faced through songs proclaiming

657
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.400
the greatness of our God?

658
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.400
Why are we unmoved by the preaching of

659
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.500
the good news of Jesus in our place? Why are

660
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.100
we callous to what other people and the way we treat them

661
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.400
at any matter. We just say what we want to say doesn't matter we speak

662
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.200
and type whatever we want to say.

663
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.200
Why does our commitment to the Lord wane?

664
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.800
Every day it wavers back and forth.

665
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.600
When you think about this parable?

666
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.000
our love grows cold

667
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.900
possibly because we have a very small sense

668
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.000
of the huge debt that we've been.

669
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.600
Forgiven do we really remember what he saved

670
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.000
us from?

671
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.600
With that not make him then the

672
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.500
most important thing in our entire lives

673
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.400
that we don't care what everybody else thinks about the way

674
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.200
we respond to our Savior.

675
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.200
The truth of God's good news sinks

676
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.000
deeply into your soul.

677
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.200
If you remember the depths from which

678
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.800
Jesus has saved you.

679
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.900
Then you will gladly and boldly worship

680
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.000
him no matter what else anyone else thinks.

681
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.100
like this woman

682
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.400
it's broken all week over this woman. Just thinking about

683
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.300
the scene the sobbing mess at Jesus's

684
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.500
feet.

685
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.100
But she's bringing her best to

686
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.600
him because she loved her forgiving

687
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.800
savior so much.

688
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.300
Again, the more you understand what Jesus said The

689
00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.500
more you understand what you've been forgiven of the more he will love

690
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.200
much.

691
00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.200
You'll be full of gratitude. You will

692
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.400
obey better. You will sing louder you

693
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.900
will give generously you will serve sacrificially when

694
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.300
you get it in your soul the

695
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.100
more and more which by the way, you might think I've been Christian a long time.

696
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.400
How can I grow in this you'll never stop growing even into eternity?

697
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.300
Because you'll discover more about God forever and ever and ever

698
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.100
if he's infinite. You're not you're gonna learn more.

699
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.300
So don't think I got it all figured out you have a lot

700
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:21.800
to learn.

701
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.400
I have a long way to go yet and I

702
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.100
need to see Jesus and you

703
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.700
will do all of that. If you get in your heart, you'll do all that boldly because

704
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.800
Jesus is completely changed your life. He's made

705
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.500
you a new creation. The old has gone. The newest comes Secretary

706
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.500
of like he's gonna make you and is making you and has made

707
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.700
you completely new forever.

708
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.500
So listen, if you wherever you are, whatever

709
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.300
you are, whoever you are, whatever your past looks like if you

710
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.100
are in that moment like her right now come to Jesus.

711
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.100
It's who he is?

712
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.200
and if you've experienced his forgiveness

713
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.600
What else can you do but worship

714
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.000
him with everything you are?

715
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.400
To give your life to Jesus saying all

716
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.500
of me is all yours God.

717
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.400
