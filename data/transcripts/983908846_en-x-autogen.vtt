00:00:01.285 --> 00:00:03.615
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:06.815
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.575
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.935
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.095
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.095
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:38.645
Wow. So, uh, sometimes it's really interesting

8
00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:41.885
how the sovereignty of God works things out in our lives.

9
00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:47.165
And all week I've been studying Psalm 72 in preparation

10
00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:50.525
for today as we've been just taking one by one as we go

11
00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:52.725
through the Psalms and,

12
00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.885
and what it shows us is a picture of an ideal king

13
00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.695
of what Israel's king was supposed to

14
00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:03.655
be like supposed to do.

15
00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:06.655
But really in the end it shows us that every one

16
00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:08.015
of those kings fell short.

17
00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:12.355
And so what it then shifted into was that it was

18
00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:16.635
to point them and point us to the true king,

19
00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:21.475
to the Messiah, the king of Israel, Jesus.

20
00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:26.515
But then as I watched the events of last night unfold

21
00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:31.325
and I sat there pondering why God had chosen to put us

22
00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:36.045
in Psalm 72 this week in light

23
00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:37.845
of the political mess we're facing.

24
00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.765
And I wrestled with whether I should just throw the whole

25
00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:44.165
thing out and do something different

26
00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:48.535
or should I like preach it

27
00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:50.855
as is if nothing ever happened last night

28
00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:55.255
or should I just watch what God wants to do to tweak it?

29
00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:57.495
Well, so I, I sent a message to the elders

30
00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.295
and we began praying and just considering,

31
00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:01.575
okay, what do we do with this?

32
00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:04.655
Throughout the evening began praying and considering and,

33
00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:07.455
and so as we did that it was, it was like God's

34
00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:12.695
leading was giving confidence that this is

35
00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:13.935
where God wants us to be

36
00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:20.175
in Psalm 72 talking about the ideal Messiah king.

37
00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:24.415
And it doesn't minimize what's happened.

38
00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:28.695
It's not to be insensitive to loss and pain

39
00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:31.615
or even uncertainty about the future of our nation

40
00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:33.495
or how things are gonna work out politically.

41
00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:35.055
It's not to minimize any of that,

42
00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:37.615
but it's to point to what is solid

43
00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:42.215
and to point to what is eternal in the end.

44
00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:47.255
How no earthly leader can fulfill this.

45
00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:51.855
Yes, we'll see that.

46
00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:54.295
But also it's gonna lead us, I believe, to show us

47
00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:58.295
how we should respond, how we should

48
00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:01.045
handle the uncertainty

49
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:03.885
and the fear that we might feel at times.

50
00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:10.615
So again, let's pray, asking God for help in that Lord, I

51
00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:15.015
has, you've already seen needy

52
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:19.335
and grateful for prayers of your saints, your people.

53
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:23.695
But Lord we need you to speak to us through your word.

54
00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:29.215
Holy Spirit, use your word to deeply affect us,

55
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:32.015
to teach us as Psalm 86 11.

56
00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:33.935
Teach us your way, oh God,

57
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:39.055
that we may walk in your truth, unite

58
00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:42.295
our hearts to fear your name,

59
00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:47.735
to have a soul focus on you above all else.

60
00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:54.645
Teach us Lord, we need you. Thank you.

61
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.845
In Jesus' name. Amen.

62
00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:01.875
Then so if you're not already there, go ahead

63
00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:02.915
and take your copy of God's word.

64
00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:04.635
Turn with me to Psalm 72.

65
00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:09.395
Um, I did spend a couple hours last night tweaking this

66
00:04:09.655 --> 00:04:12.955
sermon and so I'm praying that being sensitive

67
00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:15.035
to God's spirit is what he wants us

68
00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:16.635
to do today as we've already seen.

69
00:04:19.095 --> 00:04:20.595
But as we look at Psalm 72,

70
00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:22.955
just look at the very last verse.

71
00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:28.075
First, provide some context on this psalm

72
00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:31.515
and really the entire journey we've taken over the last five

73
00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:33.635
years as we've walked through the Psalms to this point.

74
00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:39.125
Look at verse 20. It says, the prayers of David, the son

75
00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.645
of Jesse are ended.

76
00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.465
Now, you might not realize this,

77
00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.665
but the entire, what we call the book

78
00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:50.305
of the Psalms 150 Psalms

79
00:04:51.045 --> 00:04:54.625
is really arranged into five books as you look right

80
00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.425
below verse 20 and it says Book three in big

81
00:04:57.425 --> 00:04:58.665
letters probably doesn't it?

82
00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:03.385
And these five books in the Psalms

83
00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:08.345
loosely tell the story of Israel, like books one

84
00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:10.465
and two, you've got from Psalm one

85
00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:12.945
through here in Psalm 72 are primarily by David,

86
00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:16.665
this victorious king and the development of the kingdom.

87
00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:20.945
And then you get to Psalm 73 shifts into book three.

88
00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:23.625
Next week it, it gets pretty dark

89
00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:25.465
because what it talks about is the kings

90
00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:29.105
and the kingdom falling and the sanctuary being destroyed.

91
00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:30.265
And then you get into book four,

92
00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:34.025
it talks primarily about the exile of Israel

93
00:05:34.025 --> 00:05:35.705
and then book five is the restoration.

94
00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:37.985
So you can kind of trace the history

95
00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:40.625
of Israel throughout the Book of Psalms.

96
00:05:40.645 --> 00:05:43.345
And yet what we've seen so far, books one

97
00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:45.825
and two are primarily the prayers of David,

98
00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:47.745
the victorious king.

99
00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.945
We'll see more from David a few times in three, four

100
00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:55.825
and five, but but primarily David yet look at the heading

101
00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:57.245
of Psalm 72.

102
00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:03.125
What does it say? It says of Solomon.

103
00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:06.795
Now we aren't sure if Solomon wrote this himself

104
00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:08.835
or maybe someone else wrote it for him.

105
00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:12.475
Could have been his dad. David wrote this for Solomon,

106
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:17.075
yet it works beyond Solomon at the same time.

107
00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:23.755
See this, this is to Solomon in some sense,

108
00:06:23.815 --> 00:06:25.875
but it's also to future kings

109
00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:29.595
after him as well as to the nations

110
00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:36.705
because it, it works beyond just one person.

111
00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:37.985
We'll see it very clearly.

112
00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:40.345
Look at it with me and just imagine this scene like

113
00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:44.905
Solomon's being cor, the coronation of Solomon as the king.

114
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:47.825
Just imagine that this is being read at his

115
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.785
or anyone else's coronation

116
00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:55.675
and listen with the mind to see what it is pointing us

117
00:06:55.735 --> 00:06:57.475
to give the king your justice.

118
00:06:57.775 --> 00:07:00.555
Oh God, may your righteousness to the royal Son.

119
00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.475
May he judge your people with righteousness

120
00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:05.235
and your poor with justice.

121
00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:08.555
Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people,

122
00:07:08.655 --> 00:07:10.075
the hills in righteousness.

123
00:07:10.935 --> 00:07:13.395
May he defend the cause of the poor of the people.

124
00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:16.235
Give deliverance to the chil children of the needy

125
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.475
and crush the oppressor.

126
00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:23.975
May he endure or may they fear you while the sun endures

127
00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:27.095
as long as the moon throughout all generations.

128
00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.575
May he be like rain that falls on the moon grass like

129
00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.775
showers that water the earth in his days.

130
00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.815
May the righteous flourish and peace abound

131
00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:37.335
till the moon be no more.

132
00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:39.975
May he have dominion from sea to sea,

133
00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:41.535
from the river to the ends of the earth.

134
00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:44.655
May desert tribes bow down before him

135
00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:46.055
and his enemies lick the dust.

136
00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:48.415
May the kings of Tarshish

137
00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:50.175
and of the coastlands render him tribute.

138
00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:53.095
May the kings of Sheba and Siba bring gifts.

139
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.215
May all kings fall down before him

140
00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:57.775
and all nations serve him

141
00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:00.935
for he delivers the needy when he calls the poor

142
00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:02.135
and him who has no helper.

143
00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:04.255
He has pity on the weak and the needy

144
00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:05.815
and saves the lives of the needy

145
00:08:06.565 --> 00:08:07.935
from oppression and violence.

146
00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:11.175
He redeems their life. Precious is their blood in his sight.

147
00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:16.495
Long may he live. May gold of Sheba be given to him.

148
00:08:17.555 --> 00:08:19.455
May prayer be made for him continually

149
00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:21.735
and blessings invoked for him all the day.

150
00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:24.455
May there be abundance of grain in the

151
00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:25.655
land on the tops of the mountains.

152
00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:27.775
May it wave, may its fruit.

153
00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:30.855
Be like Lebanon and may people blossom in the cities like

154
00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:31.935
the grass of the field.

155
00:08:32.915 --> 00:08:35.975
May his name endure forever, his fame continue

156
00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:37.095
as long as the sun.

157
00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:41.935
May people be blessed in him. All nations call him blessed.

158
00:08:43.205 --> 00:08:45.055
Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel

159
00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:46.855
who alone does wondrous things,

160
00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:50.015
blessed be his glorious name forever.

161
00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:54.895
May the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and amen.

162
00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:57.445
Amen. And the prayers of David, the son of Jesse

163
00:08:58.145 --> 00:08:59.145
Are ended.

164
00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:04.105
So like I said before, this psalm

165
00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:07.385
was setting out the parameters of

166
00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:10.345
what we would call the ideal Davidic king.

167
00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:13.705
If you remember your history,

168
00:09:14.685 --> 00:09:16.385
God made a covenant with King David.

169
00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:19.905
This is second Samuel chapter seven, where one

170
00:09:19.905 --> 00:09:23.225
of David's sons would sit on the throne of Israel forever.

171
00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:29.535
That this Psalm 72 was then what

172
00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.455
that king was supposed to be like.

173
00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:36.375
This is what they were supposed to live like and act like.

174
00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:40.045
By the way, this Psalm sets us up nicely

175
00:09:40.305 --> 00:09:43.325
for our study in First Samuel beginning in August

176
00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:46.405
as we talk about how that kingship even developed.

177
00:09:47.305 --> 00:09:51.405
But again, this psalm itself is talking about what kind

178
00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:54.005
of king David's son, Solomon

179
00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:57.495
and beyond was to be like

180
00:09:57.675 --> 00:10:00.495
how was his reign supposed to be characterized?

181
00:10:03.795 --> 00:10:07.965
Well, a commentator was, was putting this together in a,

182
00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:09.005
in a really clear way.

183
00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:10.405
And so I'm gonna follow his thoughts here,

184
00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:14.125
but he first said this king was to be just

185
00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:18.005
and righteous David's son.

186
00:10:18.265 --> 00:10:20.125
The king was to be just

187
00:10:20.665 --> 00:10:24.685
and righteous verses one and two.

188
00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:26.365
Again, give the king your justice.

189
00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:29.685
Oh God, may your and your righteousness to the royal Son.

190
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:32.285
May he judge your people with righteousness

191
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:34.205
and you're poor with justice.

192
00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:38.525
So this king, the primary evidence of his justice

193
00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:42.125
and righteousness for the people was in his concern

194
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.205
for the poor, concern for the needy, concern

195
00:10:45.225 --> 00:10:47.445
for the oppressed, the defenseless, the weak.

196
00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:51.245
How did he handle those people that wealth

197
00:10:51.465 --> 00:10:54.925
and power did not supersede humanity, that he cared

198
00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:56.125
for all people equally.

199
00:10:58.615 --> 00:11:01.245
Verse four, may he defend the cause of the poor

200
00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:03.565
of the people give deliverance to the children of the need.

201
00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:04.685
He crushed the oppressor.

202
00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:09.405
Verse 12, he delivers the needy when he calls the poor in

203
00:11:09.405 --> 00:11:11.045
him who has no helper.

204
00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.245
Verse 13, he has pity on the weak.

205
00:11:13.265 --> 00:11:15.005
The needy saves the lives of the needy.

206
00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:16.805
Verse 14, from oppression

207
00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:18.565
and violence, he redeems their life.

208
00:11:19.285 --> 00:11:21.885
Precious is their blood in his sight.

209
00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:25.085
The ideal Davidic king was to be full of compassion,

210
00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:31.495
to see the lives of the weak in his kingdom as precious

211
00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:35.935
to him, not as castoffs, but as precious

212
00:11:35.935 --> 00:11:38.255
because that's the way God is towards us.

213
00:11:38.675 --> 00:11:41.655
That's the way the king was to be to his kingdom.

214
00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:44.535
In fact, it's the way we're supposed

215
00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:45.695
to be as well, isn't it?

216
00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:50.455
So the king was to be just and righteous.

217
00:11:50.455 --> 00:11:53.205
Next we find the king's reign was to be peaceful.

218
00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:58.245
His reign was to be characterized as peaceful.

219
00:11:58.245 --> 00:12:00.365
That's the word in verse three

220
00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:03.005
and verse seven, character, uh, translated

221
00:12:03.065 --> 00:12:05.485
as prosperity and peace.

222
00:12:05.555 --> 00:12:07.165
It's the Hebrew word shalom.

223
00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:12.045
It's translated prosperity and peace. It means peace.

224
00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:14.205
Yes, but it's mean. It means more than that.

225
00:12:15.745 --> 00:12:18.325
It means wellbeing, it means wholeness.

226
00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:20.045
It means that you have enough.

227
00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:22.645
It means that you're able to say with timon,

228
00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:24.325
ooba, haku, matata.

229
00:12:26.505 --> 00:12:27.725
Now that's not a Hebrew phrase

230
00:12:27.725 --> 00:12:28.925
that we're gonna have to translate, right?

231
00:12:28.925 --> 00:12:31.805
That's some other language that means no worries,

232
00:12:33.055 --> 00:12:35.075
that's shalom, that's peace.

233
00:12:35.215 --> 00:12:37.395
It means you don't have anything to worry about.

234
00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:38.715
But back in the Old Testament,

235
00:12:38.715 --> 00:12:42.595
this word shalom was expressed often by abundant crops,

236
00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:48.265
grass for the sheep, fruit trees that flourished.

237
00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:50.225
You see it in verse three.

238
00:12:50.365 --> 00:12:54.225
Let the mountains bear prosperity shalom for the people

239
00:12:56.765 --> 00:12:58.135
like you see it in verse seven.

240
00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:00.615
In his days, may the righteous flourish

241
00:13:00.835 --> 00:13:04.375
and peace abound till the moon be no more.

242
00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.735
That's the shalom. He's talking about this.

243
00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:10.975
This rain was to be characterized by peace.

244
00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:16.165
And in an agricultural setting like that, they had

245
00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:18.605
to have rain from the clouds for that to happen, right?

246
00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:23.405
That's why. Look at verse six, the king's rain, R-E-G-I-G-N.

247
00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:27.765
His rain was to be compared to rain. RAIN.

248
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:28.965
That falls from the sky.

249
00:13:29.815 --> 00:13:33.285
Verse six, may he the king be like rain

250
00:13:33.675 --> 00:13:36.245
that falls on the moan grass like showers

251
00:13:36.245 --> 00:13:41.165
that water the earth, the king's reign, his rule was

252
00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:44.445
to bring shalom to the people,

253
00:13:47.665 --> 00:13:49.365
but not just for the people of Israel.

254
00:13:49.385 --> 00:13:52.805
If you saw in Psalm 72, the ideal Davidic king's reign was

255
00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:55.285
to be worldwide as well.

256
00:13:57.775 --> 00:14:00.225
This was to be a worldwide kingdom.

257
00:14:01.115 --> 00:14:05.255
Verse eight, may he have dominion from sea to sea

258
00:14:05.355 --> 00:14:09.055
and from the river the Euphrates to the ends

259
00:14:09.235 --> 00:14:10.375
of the earth.

260
00:14:10.525 --> 00:14:13.295
That was the entire known world at the time.

261
00:14:15.195 --> 00:14:18.425
All of it. And then you add verses nine through 11,

262
00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:20.705
may desert tribes bow down before him.

263
00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:21.745
His enemies lick the dust.

264
00:14:21.805 --> 00:14:24.545
May the kings of Tarshish weigh at the end of the sea

265
00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:26.665
of the coastlands, render him tribute.

266
00:14:26.925 --> 00:14:28.225
May the kings of Sheba

267
00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:31.385
and Siba, those were from North Africa, bring gifts.

268
00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.625
May all kings fall down before him.

269
00:14:33.845 --> 00:14:37.185
All nations serve this just

270
00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:38.985
and righteous king.

271
00:14:41.805 --> 00:14:46.335
This psalm asked God to sow, extend the rule of the king

272
00:14:46.335 --> 00:14:50.295
that all nations would submit to his rule and reign

273
00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:53.285
and thereby receive the blessings of God's kingdom

274
00:14:53.595 --> 00:14:58.455
through the king supposed to be worldwide.

275
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.535
Remember that promise was made actually back in Genesis 12

276
00:15:01.675 --> 00:15:05.455
to Abraham that all the families

277
00:15:05.755 --> 00:15:07.655
of the earth would be blessed through him.

278
00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:11.135
How's that gonna play out through the Davidic King?

279
00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:16.135
Verse 17, may his name endure forever.

280
00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:18.255
His fame continue as long as the son.

281
00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:19.975
May people check this out.

282
00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:22.455
May people be blessed in him

283
00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:24.735
and all nations call him blessed.

284
00:15:24.835 --> 00:15:25.935
Is that not Genesis 12?

285
00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:30.915
So it's to be worldwide.

286
00:15:31.745 --> 00:15:35.675
It's also we learn here to be long, the king's reign was

287
00:15:35.695 --> 00:15:40.165
to be long verse

288
00:15:40.395 --> 00:15:43.965
15, long may he live the request

289
00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:45.925
that this king would live a long time.

290
00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:48.245
Verse 17, may his name endure forever

291
00:15:48.505 --> 00:15:51.725
and a long reign for this king would be a good thing if he's

292
00:15:51.845 --> 00:15:53.685
bringing shalom and prosperity

293
00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:56.445
and peace to all people, all nations, right?

294
00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:59.005
That would mean we want him to stay in power longer.

295
00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:05.285
It's a long supposed to be a long rule.

296
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:09.375
Yet here's what we can't forget.

297
00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.375
Did you notice all these requests

298
00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.375
and all the benefits have a source?

299
00:16:15.995 --> 00:16:18.365
This Davidic King's reign was to be

300
00:16:18.925 --> 00:16:21.045
dependent if it was gonna work at all.

301
00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:25.175
His reign was to be

302
00:16:25.895 --> 00:16:28.975
dependent, dependent on what?

303
00:16:29.915 --> 00:16:34.595
On his own strength, on his own abilities,

304
00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:37.275
on his own nation's resources

305
00:16:37.275 --> 00:16:38.715
that he's got everything he has.

306
00:16:38.895 --> 00:16:43.195
No, he's depe. He's to be dependent on the divine king.

307
00:16:45.875 --> 00:16:47.285
What does verse one start with?

308
00:16:47.565 --> 00:16:49.765
A request that God would give justice

309
00:16:49.865 --> 00:16:51.125
and righteousness to the king.

310
00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:56.205
The whole thing is a prayer for the king.

311
00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.605
And on behalf of the king God, do this.

312
00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:00.845
God make this happen as wealthy

313
00:17:01.305 --> 00:17:05.725
and as powerful as every Davidic king would be in Israel

314
00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:07.005
and eventually in Judah,

315
00:17:07.035 --> 00:17:10.685
they were still fully dependent on God for everything,

316
00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:17.895
which is why I believe verses 18 and 19 are included here.

317
00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.015
Because here's another aspect

318
00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:22.775
of the ideal Davidic king's reign.

319
00:17:22.835 --> 00:17:24.655
It was to be doxological.

320
00:17:27.555 --> 00:17:31.155
It's a long word doxological.

321
00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:34.805
It means worshipful

322
00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:41.855
that his reign was to lead people to worship God.

323
00:17:43.885 --> 00:17:45.335
Because look at verses 18

324
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:49.925
and 19 again, it says, blessed be the Lord Yahweh,

325
00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:54.245
the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things,

326
00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:57.285
blessed be his glorious name forever.

327
00:17:58.065 --> 00:18:02.045
May the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen.

328
00:18:02.105 --> 00:18:03.445
Let it be and let it be.

329
00:18:03.545 --> 00:18:07.365
He says, So when you look at this psalm, you think

330
00:18:07.525 --> 00:18:09.365
of an earthly king living this out.

331
00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:12.805
They would be worthy of honor. They'd be worthy of praise.

332
00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:17.145
Yes, but I've

333
00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:18.505
heard it said so well.

334
00:18:18.645 --> 00:18:22.425
The ultimate praise is directed to the ultimate source

335
00:18:22.765 --> 00:18:25.145
of the king's just and righteous reign.

336
00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:28.215
The ultimate praise is not to that king.

337
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:30.615
The ultimate praise is to Yahweh, who's the source

338
00:18:30.915 --> 00:18:32.135
of everything that king has.

339
00:18:34.415 --> 00:18:37.715
In fact, that was again one of the most primary jobs

340
00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:43.275
for the king of Israel, was to point his people to Yahweh,

341
00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:48.865
to remind them of God's word, to uphold proper ways

342
00:18:48.865 --> 00:18:50.745
of worship and sacrifice in life.

343
00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:52.785
Like this is how life should work, this is

344
00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:54.465
how God should be worshiped.

345
00:18:54.465 --> 00:18:56.705
They were supposed to do that which would lead to worship

346
00:18:57.165 --> 00:18:59.465
and blessing and glory being given

347
00:18:59.465 --> 00:19:01.625
to God throughout the whole earth forever and ever.

348
00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:05.475
That was the intention for every

349
00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:06.945
King.

350
00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:11.565
And so this psalm paints a beautiful picture of

351
00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:14.885
what the ideal Davidic King should be like.

352
00:19:17.535 --> 00:19:21.485
And as the heading suggests, Solomon was the first,

353
00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:26.305
I Mean, just think of life, that life

354
00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:27.705
and reign of Solomon.

355
00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:31.915
Solomon was just and righteous.

356
00:19:31.935 --> 00:19:33.795
He was the wisest man who ever lived.

357
00:19:34.295 --> 00:19:37.115
He was able to discern incredibly difficult, difficult cases

358
00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:41.235
and he readily provided for the poor in the land.

359
00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:45.325
He led the most peaceful

360
00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:49.405
and prosperous era of shalom in Israel's history.

361
00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:56.075
His reach was worldwide. In fact, the Queen of Sheba.

362
00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:58.875
Remember we saw Sheba a couple times here in Psalm 72,

363
00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:02.235
the Queen of Sheba in Ethiopia heard about Solomon's wealth

364
00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:05.475
and wisdom and she came traveling, bringing gifts.

365
00:20:10.785 --> 00:20:13.115
Solomon was also very dependent on the Lord

366
00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:16.085
at the beginning of his reign.

367
00:20:16.155 --> 00:20:18.845
This is what one Kings three records, him praying

368
00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:24.045
to God, Solomon prays.

369
00:20:24.105 --> 00:20:27.365
Now, Lord God, you have made your servant king in place

370
00:20:27.365 --> 00:20:28.965
of David, my father, although I'm

371
00:20:28.965 --> 00:20:32.425
but a little child, I do not know how to go out or come in.

372
00:20:32.425 --> 00:20:33.585
And your servant is in the midst

373
00:20:33.585 --> 00:20:36.745
of your people whom you've chosen a great people too many

374
00:20:36.745 --> 00:20:38.705
to be numbered or counted for multitude.

375
00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:41.625
Give your servant therefore an understanding mind

376
00:20:41.885 --> 00:20:44.985
to govern your people that I may discern between good

377
00:20:44.985 --> 00:20:48.205
and evil for who is able to to govern this,

378
00:20:48.355 --> 00:20:49.725
your great people.

379
00:20:51.595 --> 00:20:55.015
And God answered his prayer by giving him abundant wisdom.

380
00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:57.775
The wisest man who ever's lived and abundant wealth

381
00:20:57.775 --> 00:20:58.855
because he didn't ask for it.

382
00:20:58.855 --> 00:21:02.375
He asked for wisdom and God blessed him beyond measure.

383
00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:09.415
And finally, Solomon's reign was doxological.

384
00:21:11.955 --> 00:21:13.535
His father, David wanted to,

385
00:21:13.635 --> 00:21:15.815
but he could never build God's temple

386
00:21:15.815 --> 00:21:17.815
because of all of his experiences at war.

387
00:21:19.015 --> 00:21:21.315
He had to clear the land of all the enemies of God.

388
00:21:21.335 --> 00:21:24.475
And so David couldn't do it. But Solomon finally did.

389
00:21:25.985 --> 00:21:27.795
Solomon built God's house

390
00:21:27.855 --> 00:21:31.195
and at its dedication, he led the people in many sacrifices

391
00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.435
and praises and blessings to God.

392
00:21:33.575 --> 00:21:37.115
It was a rich worship experience. And he kept doing that.

393
00:21:37.415 --> 00:21:38.515
He kept doing that.

394
00:21:43.525 --> 00:21:43.745
Yet,

395
00:21:48.535 --> 00:21:48.755
yet

396
00:21:53.905 --> 00:21:56.965
as great as one kings, one

397
00:21:56.965 --> 00:21:59.525
through 10 shows us it was for Solomon.

398
00:22:02.465 --> 00:22:06.165
As great as his wisdom was, as great as his wealth was

399
00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:08.365
as prosperous as the nation was.

400
00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:12.925
One kings one through 10 shows us the incredible picture of

401
00:22:12.925 --> 00:22:15.365
what it looked like when solemn was at the peak.

402
00:22:15.865 --> 00:22:20.335
In the very next chapter, we see this

403
00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:25.355
one Kings 11 verse one.

404
00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:29.235
Now, king Solomon loved many foreign women.

405
00:22:33.775 --> 00:22:37.665
See, God had earlier warned his people not

406
00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:40.745
to intermarry with those who worship other gods.

407
00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:45.465
Not because he didn't love the nations, it was

408
00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:48.065
because he knew that his people's hearts would be stolen

409
00:22:48.175 --> 00:22:50.145
away from worshiping him.

410
00:22:54.025 --> 00:22:58.725
Yet verse two, Solomon clung to these in love,

411
00:23:01.165 --> 00:23:02.315
700 of them.

412
00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:10.105
And what do we read next?

413
00:23:11.675 --> 00:23:14.535
And his wives turned away, his heart,

414
00:23:16.515 --> 00:23:20.655
he even built, remember the guy who built the temple

415
00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:23.465
even travels around the country,

416
00:23:23.555 --> 00:23:26.145
begin building shrines to all these false

417
00:23:26.335 --> 00:23:30.535
Gods That his wives were worshiping.

418
00:23:34.585 --> 00:23:38.965
And immediately we see God was angry with Solomon, raises up

419
00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:44.975
the enemy within his walls, tell Solomon,

420
00:23:45.035 --> 00:23:46.675
the kingdom's gonna soon break apart.

421
00:23:46.775 --> 00:23:48.955
All the prosperity and honor that you had

422
00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:50.795
before is soon going to be gone.

423
00:23:54.165 --> 00:23:55.505
And so here's the tragic point.

424
00:23:57.955 --> 00:24:02.445
Even Solomon in all his glory did not live up

425
00:24:02.445 --> 00:24:05.885
to fell far short of the ideal Davidic king.

426
00:24:05.915 --> 00:24:07.805
Picture we see in Psalm 72,

427
00:24:11.735 --> 00:24:14.665
Solomon was as close as Israel ever got

428
00:24:14.885 --> 00:24:16.185
to this actually happening.

429
00:24:16.285 --> 00:24:18.145
And yet he failed.

430
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.745
You trace the story of Solomon's life.

431
00:24:21.745 --> 00:24:22.945
Even we saw it right there. He did

432
00:24:22.945 --> 00:24:24.065
not live a righteous life.

433
00:24:24.985 --> 00:24:26.105
Strife and battles.

434
00:24:26.105 --> 00:24:29.305
No more shalom strife and war reentered the land.

435
00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:31.745
They lost influence globally.

436
00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:35.305
He failed to depend on God and worship God alone

437
00:24:35.365 --> 00:24:36.705
and he eventually died.

438
00:24:40.235 --> 00:24:41.575
But it wasn't only Solomon,

439
00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:46.385
even though Psalm 72 portrays this ideal king,

440
00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:50.025
how they were supposed to live each successive king

441
00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:53.225
after Solomon seemed to get progressively worse.

442
00:24:57.545 --> 00:25:01.085
Now, there are glimpses at times of reforms

443
00:25:01.085 --> 00:25:04.245
that kings would try to bring back to Psalm 72 in Judah.

444
00:25:04.245 --> 00:25:07.165
But ultimately what we see is failure

445
00:25:07.535 --> 00:25:11.765
after failure of even this Davidic line of kings.

446
00:25:15.655 --> 00:25:17.625
That means there was something more going on in

447
00:25:17.625 --> 00:25:18.825
Psalm 72, right?

448
00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:22.075
Something deeper.

449
00:25:25.935 --> 00:25:29.065
Well over time what Psalm 72 turned into as the people

450
00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:31.745
of Israel saw none of our kings are gonna live this out.

451
00:25:33.245 --> 00:25:37.515
What it turned into was then their desire

452
00:25:37.735 --> 00:25:39.355
for a perfect king.

453
00:25:40.615 --> 00:25:43.075
It it turned into a prayer for the coming

454
00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:45.715
of the anointed king, the Messiah.

455
00:25:47.075 --> 00:25:49.685
They started to read it with with eyes that began

456
00:25:49.685 --> 00:25:52.605
to look forward instead of just like, is this the guy?

457
00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:54.205
Is this the guy They were looking forward

458
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:55.445
to, something to come.

459
00:25:59.045 --> 00:26:02.585
Now they were looking for a good

460
00:26:02.605 --> 00:26:04.185
and righteous king here,

461
00:26:05.325 --> 00:26:09.105
but there was this understanding that only a fully divine

462
00:26:09.245 --> 00:26:11.505
as well as fully human king could actually live up

463
00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:14.705
to this ideal right as every king comes

464
00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:16.305
to the throne they were supposed to.

465
00:26:16.305 --> 00:26:20.985
And it was right to pursue Psalm 72 for the people to desire

466
00:26:20.985 --> 00:26:22.065
that from their leader.

467
00:26:22.405 --> 00:26:25.265
But it was also ultimately their hope could only be

468
00:26:25.265 --> 00:26:27.305
fulfilled in this Messiah king who's coming.

469
00:26:29.285 --> 00:26:30.975
They saw the weakness, they saw the failure,

470
00:26:31.155 --> 00:26:34.895
and this was something they needed in the future.

471
00:26:40.925 --> 00:26:44.085
That led me to think of things last night

472
00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:45.925
that I saw a pastor friend post.

473
00:26:48.605 --> 00:26:52.655
That we look around at all the anger and hatred and violence

474
00:26:52.795 --> 00:26:56.745
and division plaguing our nation and our world

475
00:26:56.765 --> 00:26:59.305
and we ask, okay, so what's the answer like?

476
00:27:01.335 --> 00:27:05.305
Like what is the answer to the seeds

477
00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:08.585
that Satan plants of discord

478
00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:13.425
and distrust where we begin to see fellow image bearers

479
00:27:13.425 --> 00:27:14.625
of God not as humans,

480
00:27:14.765 --> 00:27:18.145
but as obstacles to what we feel like we want and need.

481
00:27:20.665 --> 00:27:24.705
What is the answer? I think

482
00:27:24.705 --> 00:27:25.705
that's the wrong question.

483
00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:30.035
What? What is the answer

484
00:27:30.135 --> 00:27:33.155
to us viewing those things as justifiable?

485
00:27:33.155 --> 00:27:34.635
The anger, the discord, the violence.

486
00:27:34.895 --> 00:27:36.755
We see that as justifiable in our own minds,

487
00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:39.875
but we can't help but think it's just abhorrent

488
00:27:40.235 --> 00:27:41.875
whenever they on the other side would do it to us.

489
00:27:43.515 --> 00:27:45.605
What is the answer? I think that's the wrong question.

490
00:27:49.525 --> 00:27:53.285
I think to get to the root, we need

491
00:27:53.285 --> 00:27:54.485
to ask who is the answer?

492
00:27:57.615 --> 00:28:00.345
Because what this is pointing to is that there's nothing

493
00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:02.505
inherent in what.

494
00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:04.585
That's the answer. It's the who.

495
00:28:04.585 --> 00:28:05.305
That's the answer

496
00:28:09.995 --> 00:28:10.695
and the who.

497
00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:13.495
That's the answer is not whichever

498
00:28:13.565 --> 00:28:15.175
political leader you favor.

499
00:28:18.535 --> 00:28:19.785
It's not a military leader.

500
00:28:19.855 --> 00:28:21.585
It's not a a philosophical leader.

501
00:28:21.655 --> 00:28:23.865
It's not an education reformer.

502
00:28:23.865 --> 00:28:26.425
Because the reality of every single one of those people is

503
00:28:26.425 --> 00:28:27.825
that they all need a savior too.

504
00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:36.535
The answer has been Jesus still is Jesus

505
00:28:36.755 --> 00:28:38.215
and will always be Jesus.

506
00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:46.335
See, that's the truth

507
00:28:47.675 --> 00:28:50.885
that I believe Psalm 72 ultimately shows us church

508
00:28:52.115 --> 00:28:54.485
that Christ did

509
00:28:54.985 --> 00:28:58.325
and will ultimately fulfill this ideal

510
00:29:00.195 --> 00:29:01.565
that he fully met it

511
00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:03.765
and he will fully meet it forever and ever.

512
00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:06.885
He is this ideal, the only one who

513
00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:10.965
ultimately fulfills this picture of the ideal king. That's

514
00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:11.965
Right.

515
00:29:13.415 --> 00:29:15.845
Watch this. Think of

516
00:29:15.945 --> 00:29:20.765
how the magi from far east lands came

517
00:29:20.865 --> 00:29:22.965
to his birth and what did they bring?

518
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.685
Gold and frankincense and mer.

519
00:29:25.685 --> 00:29:28.685
These kings from afar brought him gifts.

520
00:29:31.235 --> 00:29:34.025
Think of how Christ as he lived his life was filled

521
00:29:34.055 --> 00:29:37.225
with the justice of God as he treated the poor fairly.

522
00:29:37.525 --> 00:29:40.545
He rescued children of the needy. He had pity on the weak.

523
00:29:40.765 --> 00:29:42.645
He saw them as precious.

524
00:29:45.695 --> 00:29:48.245
Think of how he lived out a perfectly righteous life

525
00:29:48.305 --> 00:29:49.725
by never sinning one time.

526
00:29:50.295 --> 00:29:54.205
Think of how he fully depended on his father in every scene

527
00:29:54.205 --> 00:29:56.405
of his life at every moment of his life. That's

528
00:29:56.405 --> 00:29:57.405
Right.

529
00:29:58.485 --> 00:30:01.825
And so we can already see glimpses of

530
00:30:01.845 --> 00:30:03.905
how Christ is the one who fulfills this,

531
00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:06.545
but there's also so much of Psalm 72 that's yet

532
00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:07.585
to be fulfilled, right?

533
00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:12.205
Like this is the principle we call already,

534
00:30:12.265 --> 00:30:16.485
but not yet that the kingdom of God has come in Christ,

535
00:30:16.505 --> 00:30:19.085
but it's not yet finally fulfilled completely.

536
00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:21.565
Yet we know it's here.

537
00:30:21.585 --> 00:30:23.685
We see glimpses of it, but it's not yet final.

538
00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:26.245
So just think again here. Let me, let me show you this.

539
00:30:28.475 --> 00:30:29.945
Think of the triumphal entry.

540
00:30:31.605 --> 00:30:33.735
John 1215 it.

541
00:30:33.755 --> 00:30:37.855
It quotes a prophecy from Zechariah chapter nine.

542
00:30:37.885 --> 00:30:41.375
This is what we see said of Jesus

543
00:30:41.595 --> 00:30:45.615
as he's writing in on a donkey into the city of Jerusalem.

544
00:30:45.615 --> 00:30:46.695
People are rejoicing him.

545
00:30:46.695 --> 00:30:48.655
They're quoting this Zechariah nine

546
00:30:49.335 --> 00:30:51.055
rejoice greatly daughter of Zion.

547
00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:53.015
Shout aloud, daughter of Jerusalem.

548
00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:56.415
Behold your king is coming to you righteous,

549
00:30:56.475 --> 00:30:57.575
having salvation.

550
00:30:57.915 --> 00:31:01.055
Is he humble and mounted on a donkey, on a cult,

551
00:31:01.235 --> 00:31:02.335
the full of a donkey.

552
00:31:02.835 --> 00:31:04.215
But listen to this next verse.

553
00:31:04.535 --> 00:31:06.775
I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim

554
00:31:06.915 --> 00:31:08.815
and the warhorse from Jerusalem.

555
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:10.575
The battle bow shall be cut off.

556
00:31:10.795 --> 00:31:14.415
He shall speak peace shalom to the nations.

557
00:31:14.835 --> 00:31:17.535
His rule shall be from sea to sea

558
00:31:17.715 --> 00:31:20.255
and from the river to the ends of the earth.

559
00:31:20.285 --> 00:31:24.665
Does that sound familiar? Who is that talking about?

560
00:31:24.915 --> 00:31:27.345
Which means? Who is Psalm 72 talking about?

561
00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:32.145
Is talking about the Messiah Jesus And

562
00:31:32.145 --> 00:31:36.065
what he's bringing it said is global shalom.

563
00:31:40.175 --> 00:31:43.675
Or think about how the crowd, a few verses later, John 1234,

564
00:31:43.675 --> 00:31:45.515
they said the Christ, they knew it.

565
00:31:45.735 --> 00:31:47.555
The Christ remains forever.

566
00:31:50.095 --> 00:31:51.265
They understood that a son

567
00:31:51.265 --> 00:31:53.425
of David would sit on the throne forever.

568
00:31:53.765 --> 00:31:55.225
How did they even come up with that?

569
00:31:55.555 --> 00:31:58.825
Psalm 72, may his name endure forever.

570
00:31:59.135 --> 00:32:03.695
What are they getting that from at this son of David?

571
00:32:03.915 --> 00:32:08.065
The eternal one has to be able to live forever.

572
00:32:11.085 --> 00:32:13.515
Think of how Isaiah 11 talks about the root of Jesse,

573
00:32:13.655 --> 00:32:16.435
the son of David, the Messiah as the one

574
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:18.395
to whom the nations will come

575
00:32:18.415 --> 00:32:22.775
and inquire to worldwide reign.

576
00:32:26.735 --> 00:32:28.355
See, this is the main point of all this today.

577
00:32:28.545 --> 00:32:30.515
It's not to make us sad about the fact

578
00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:31.835
that Solomon didn't fulfill this.

579
00:32:31.865 --> 00:32:35.555
It's to make us rejoicing that we can look forward as well

580
00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:39.115
as they did to the day when our king Jesus will come back

581
00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:43.845
again when we see the mountains of the new heavens

582
00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:47.125
and the new earth will bear perfect prosperity

583
00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:48.365
for all of God's people.

584
00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:51.525
This ideal king will reign in refreshing

585
00:32:51.785 --> 00:32:55.805
and life-giving ways to all nations who will be blessed

586
00:32:55.805 --> 00:32:58.925
through him and will bring him praise.

587
00:33:01.505 --> 00:33:04.085
And so we can pray this legitimately right?

588
00:33:04.635 --> 00:33:07.325
Come quickly Lord Jesus as Revelation 22,

589
00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.765
the very last book right

590
00:33:08.765 --> 00:33:10.525
before you get to the maps in your Bible,

591
00:33:10.785 --> 00:33:14.685
the very last phrase, come quickly, Lord Jesus, we can pray

592
00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:17.405
that because this is what he's going to bring us.

593
00:33:21.865 --> 00:33:23.005
So what do we do until then?

594
00:33:26.585 --> 00:33:27.715
What do we do? Until then?

595
00:33:32.525 --> 00:33:34.075
Let's not get caught up

596
00:33:34.815 --> 00:33:38.595
in placing our hope in a faulty king or a faulty government.

597
00:33:38.775 --> 00:33:42.645
It Our true

598
00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:44.765
king, we see him.

599
00:33:45.505 --> 00:33:47.445
We know who he is. We know where he is coming.

600
00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:52.305
Whether you're Republican or Democrat

601
00:33:52.885 --> 00:33:55.185
or independent or I don't care.

602
00:33:55.985 --> 00:34:00.735
Whatever you are, let's place our

603
00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:04.175
hope in the true king, the ideal king,

604
00:34:04.595 --> 00:34:05.815
the perfect king

605
00:34:05.955 --> 00:34:09.455
who will satisfy everything we've ever longed for.

606
00:34:13.095 --> 00:34:16.795
And as we do that, because it's already

607
00:34:16.795 --> 00:34:20.355
but not yet, as we do place our hope in that king,

608
00:34:21.745 --> 00:34:23.155
what did Jesus say to pray?

609
00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:27.315
God, your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.

610
00:34:31.325 --> 00:34:34.105
So the king's coming later.

611
00:34:34.935 --> 00:34:36.985
He's already here, but he's coming back later

612
00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:38.825
to bring his kingdom in full.

613
00:34:39.045 --> 00:34:42.545
But now your kingdom come on earth now

614
00:34:43.945 --> 00:34:45.685
as it is in heaven now.

615
00:34:49.205 --> 00:34:53.945
So what we are to do in light of our king is

616
00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:57.025
to bring his kingdom to bear on earth as it is in heaven.

617
00:34:57.055 --> 00:34:59.425
That we are ambassadors of the king.

618
00:34:59.605 --> 00:35:01.945
We are to be lights in the darkness.

619
00:35:02.005 --> 00:35:03.785
We are to shine bright so that our

620
00:35:04.295 --> 00:35:07.945
good works would give glory to our father who is in heaven.

621
00:35:08.245 --> 00:35:09.825
We are to pray for all people.

622
00:35:10.125 --> 00:35:12.265
We are to forgive as we've been forgiven.

623
00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:15.105
We are to season our words with grace.

624
00:35:15.445 --> 00:35:17.265
We are to love even our enemies.

625
00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:19.905
We are to seek wisdom from God's word.

626
00:35:19.965 --> 00:35:24.425
We are to vote our whole lives to this Christ, his worship.

627
00:35:24.725 --> 00:35:27.265
We are to share the gospel with all nations.

628
00:35:27.405 --> 00:35:29.585
We are to rejoice in the Lord always.

629
00:35:29.845 --> 00:35:32.745
We are to stand firm in the full armor of God.

630
00:35:32.885 --> 00:35:35.345
We are to remember, we don't fight against flesh and blood.

631
00:35:35.485 --> 00:35:36.825
We fight against the powers and

632
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.485
and principalities of this dark age and ultimately church.

633
00:35:40.665 --> 00:35:42.925
We are to live with full assurance

634
00:35:43.195 --> 00:35:45.485
that this victory has already been won.

635
00:35:49.795 --> 00:35:54.525
That no matter, no matter what the enemy may try, no matter

636
00:35:54.525 --> 00:35:58.285
what the world may say, there is a grave outside

637
00:35:58.285 --> 00:36:00.845
of Jerusalem that's been empty for 2000 years

638
00:36:01.065 --> 00:36:02.525
and there is a throne in heaven

639
00:36:02.675 --> 00:36:04.805
that is fully eternally occupied

640
00:36:04.805 --> 00:36:06.245
forever and ever. That's right.

641
00:36:06.545 --> 00:36:10.165
That's right. So what do we do?

642
00:36:10.505 --> 00:36:12.285
We look to the lambs. That's right.

643
00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:15.605
The lamb who is seated on the throne above all things.

644
00:36:15.705 --> 00:36:19.685
We look to the lamb, we pray, we grieve, we work

645
00:36:20.245 --> 00:36:21.725
absolutely while we are here.

646
00:36:21.945 --> 00:36:26.485
But we are to never lose this perspective, to never forget

647
00:36:26.485 --> 00:36:29.285
that this Christ is our ideal king.

648
00:36:29.475 --> 00:36:32.165
He's the one who fulfills it all on our behalf.

649
00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:36.485
He's the one we can trust everything to in our lives today.
