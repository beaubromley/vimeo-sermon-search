1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
All right,

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.000
welcome everyone to Wednesday nights

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.400
again Henderson after a long summer hot summer

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.300
away we're back. And so thank

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.900
you for being here.

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.300
At this this Venture into

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.800
something that we'll talk a lot more about over the next few minutes and get

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.400
to practice a little bit as well. Phil will

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.100
say a lot about that. But I just wanted to kind of give a context for

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.200
this allow us to all be

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.300
on the same page about why we're here what we're doing in this if you

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.300
did not get a binder. Those are

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.200
at the back at the table. Make sure you go talk to

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400
Jill especially there may be somebody else back there. I can't see but Jill especially

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.700
back there will help you get kind of the resources

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.400
and also contact information for you

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.100
just so we can help you along the way. So if you did not

18
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.200
get a binder make a journey back there in the next few

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.400
minutes to grab one of those and get what you need. Just so

20
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.900
you can have the things that everybody else has and what he'll be talking about.

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.100
but again, remember this as we call it

22
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.200
disciple making 101, this is really

23
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.500
the fruit of a long journey that God's taken me on

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.000
but also I think God taking our church on over the last

25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.400
few years. You've heard me say this for the last four years about

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.600
disciple making that's what God led me to do my just my

27
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.400
doctorate on Dr. Ministry at Southeastern

28
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.600
Seminary on disciple making relationally and

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.400
so God was spurring that on and a lot of ways for me for a

30
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.600
long period of time then God brought

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.100
Phil here just a few months ago who has a

32
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.200
doctorate in disciple making as well who studied this and practiced in

33
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.300
a local church. And so God is just been putting all the pieces together

34
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.200
that we've seen in kind of behind the

35
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.900
scenes form for the last four years, but now

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.000
it's it's starting to take on a big

37
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.200
public part of who we are as a church

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.500
and that's really exciting to me and you'll hear feel say a lot more about that. But as

39
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.300
we get into this, I wanted to set a tone set a

40
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.700
vision for this and I want you to think about

41
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.100
rhetorically questioning you right now, but in

42
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.900
your mind, just think about

43
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.100
that's that time in your life.

44
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.700
Where you can identify you grew the most spiritually.

45
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.100
I just think about okay. What was the setting who were the people

46
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.500
involved? What was the context? Where was I? How old

47
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.800
was I just just think about that for a second?

48
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.100
Kind of identifying your mind. What was that situation?

49
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.600
and

50
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.600
I've asked that question probably 10 12

51
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
times as I've spoken different places talked about disciple

52
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.200
making I've asked that question and then I'll have a dialogue at times

53
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.500
with people.

54
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.000
And 90 plus percent of the

55
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.300
time the answer is pretty much the same.

56
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.400
Every once while you get a couple like, you know, I was I was at this church in college

57
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.200
and it was really just a powerful time of worship

58
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200
every week and the preacher and those kind of things but 90 plus

59
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.100
percent of the time. It's it's a form of this.

60
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.300
It was that that time in my life where that Sunday school teacher

61
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.800
invested in two or three of us every Sunday

62
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400
afternoon, and we went to their house and we just met together

63
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.100
and talked about the Bible.

64
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.500
Or it was it was my mom sitting

65
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.400
down with me every week and we had a discipline

66
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400
time of time in the word together.

67
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.900
Or it was me and a couple college buddies and we walked together through all

68
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.400
the way through the Bible together in a year and we just kept growing

69
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.300
and and those were the most formative times and it's like

70
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.900
90 plus percent of the answers are some form.

71
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.700
Of that smaller group that relational environment.

72
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.000
And so that is what prompted me to

73
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.400
do my studies. I think the same fulfill like thinking about

74
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.400
if that is the primary Place most of

75
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.200
us have grown spiritually then where is that in the church?

76
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.400
Why is that not happening more regularly if that's

77
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.600
for most of us when we grew the most?

78
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200
Shouldn't that be a part of the pathway in the

79
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200
church? It always happens kind of outside and para church

80
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.300
or we we want it to be a part of what we do

81
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.000
here.

82
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200
So that's what this is beginning to start. We've like I said

83
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.700
been doing this a little bit behind the scenes for a few years with a few people starting

84
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.400
to get some things working. But really we needed

85
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.100
somebody like Phil to be here to help oversee the

86
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.200
pathway and help develop and train and and encourage

87
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.500
and equip you and me

88
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.800
towards this end.

89
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.500
Because remember our our mission is to equip one

90
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.800
another.

91
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.000
to love Jesus and live sent

92
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.700
so it's not just us as a staff or Elders equipping you.

93
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.200
It's equipping one another.

94
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.300
So that's all of us with all

95
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.600
of us.

96
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.900
To help each other love Jesus and live sent in more effectively.

97
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.500
So this tonight is the beginning of of revealing that

98
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.800
pathway of kind of walking us as a church towards disciple making

99
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.100
as you'll hear all of us have been called to

100
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.300
This is not new information. You've heard me say this you've heard

101
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.300
us talk like this at church. That's now our our vision is to become

102
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.200
this hub for an all ages disciple making movement that

103
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200
would glorify God, right? That's where we want to

104
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.300
head. And so what is disciple making

105
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.900
is part of that conversation. That's why we're here.

106
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.300
So I'm just so excited to see all of you here for

107
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.500
that.

108
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
I would encourage you challenge you this is

109
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.400
gonna put you in a place that you maybe haven't

110
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.500
been before challenging. You towards something. It's

111
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.400
okay, right?

112
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.500
We stay in a box and we get a little comfortable. This

113
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.200
is going to push you a little bit towards something that we

114
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.100
we know according to God's word according to

115
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.100
all of our experiences with that we know is going to to notch

116
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.400
some growth in our journey.

117
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.500
So I want to challenge you towards that.

118
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.300
Even when it gets hard, it gets a little uncomfortable. You have to push yourself

119
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.300
a little bit. That's okay. That's growth and God wants

120
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.100
to do that in US.

121
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.200
And so Phil's going to come explain a lot more about how this is

122
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.000
going to work. But I just wanted you to hear my excitement

123
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.400
over this this is what we've been praying for

124
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
and dreaming for for the last few years. And now God's put

125
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.900
the pieces together. We believe towards a pathway to

126
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.400
make disciples who make disciples who make disciples.

127
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.000
That's the definition of a movement that it passes on generationally and

128
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.400
we want to see that happen from here and through

129
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.200
here and to the ends of the Earth as we

130
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.000
go forward in this so be encouraged by that if you

131
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.700
again if you didn't get a binder head to the back grab one of those Phil, why

132
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.300
don't you come out ahead I'm gonna pray for you and then we'll get

133
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.900
going. Okay.

134
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.500
God thank you so much for what you have done already

135
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.400
in Us in so many ways. I look back to those men

136
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.500
in my life around the age of 20 to 23

137
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.600
and that season of time where you were just using these

138
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.400
guys to pour into me and then ever since

139
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.700
then.

140
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.600
As you radically transform my life through that that ever

141
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.500
since then there's been these these markers these few

142
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.400
guys just gathering around at Brahms at

143
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.600
6am and just talking about what it means to follow you Jesus looking

144
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.200
at your word applying it praying going on

145
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.300
Mission together like that.

146
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.000
Got to have seen it in me. I know so many in this

147
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.000
room have seen similar things made that become normal for us.

148
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.800
That our church sees that that we as a body become

149
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.200
disciple makers.

150
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.600
That every one of us has the responsibility may you open

151
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.000
our eyes to see that even more than we have

152
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.300
before?

153
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.300
We look forward to how you're going to use Henderson Hills

154
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.600
towards this end of of growing each

155
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.300
other as you work in us and through us.

156
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.200
This is only your work God's not ours. But but as you use

157
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200
us as vessels as tools towards that end in each other's lives. We

158
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.600
see spiritual growth happen, but then we see unbelievers come

159
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.000
to Faith and grow. We see people sent to the

160
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.100
ends of the Earth sharing the gospel God. We we want this to become.

161
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.600
What we do every one of us this is expected. It's

162
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.800
normal to pour Our Lives into somebody else.

163
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.200
To follow you first ourselves and

164
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.400
to pour Our Lives into somebody else.

165
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.300
So help us be encouraged in your word in

166
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.900
your spirit by one another that we would do this with our

167
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.300
whole lives and our time and

168
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.800
our effort and our resources God you would be glorified in

169
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.200
us. That's what we want more than anything that our lives look more

170
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.400
like you Jesus bringing more glory to you.

171
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.200
Pray for Phil. I pray that as we journey through this over the

172
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.500
next couple months that you give us Clarity give us understanding give

173
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.100
him wisdom how to instruct and give us willingness to

174
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.600
be challenged to step outside of the the

175
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.400
Comfort zones that we often stay and got

176
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.200
challenge us towards these ends in Jesus name we pray.

177
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200
Amen.

178
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.300
Thanks, Phil. Amen. Let's give our

179
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.000
professor hand.

180
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.200
I was hoping for more John but that's going to have to do.

181
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700
so one of you was so excited about discipleship that

182
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.400
when you got your

183
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.400
when you got your workbook when you wrote your name down you left your

184
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.000
cell phone on the back. So feel around for yourself and look in your purse. If

185
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.900
you don't have a cell phone, this one has a lovely picture of

186
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.100
a of a silhouette of a

187
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.500
bird. Anyway, I want

188
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.000
I want to see who it is. I want to embarrass you really bad right now.

189
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.300
All right anybody? Okay. Well, it'll be at the back.

190
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.500
But I wanted to blame us being late on

191
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.100
this cell phone but Dynamic do with

192
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.900
it at all. So we're gonna look real quickly. I

193
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.700
have a plan that we're going to work this plan every

194
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.400
Wednesday night now it'll be for our Port

195
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.100
our part will be 12 weeks, but there'll be two weeks

196
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.400
that we take off one for fall break and one for a family equipping time

197
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.500
that's in your schedule in your book. But today we're

198
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.300
going to just look very quickly at the Jesus

199
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.400
purpose for the church. It's most clearly

200
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.200
described in the Great Commission, which is Matthew 28,

201
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.900
18 19 and 20 and but

202
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.600
it's in every passage. I mean in every

203
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.300
gospel and if you'll see there in Mark 16

204
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.200
and Luke 24 and John 20, the Great Commission

205
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.400
is included in every gospel

206
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.600
and it's very clear that God utilized

207
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.900
the church to accomplish

208
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.600
his purpose and he doesn't just expect

209
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.800
it. He equips the church

210
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.800
And he empowers the church to achieve his purpose.

211
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.600
And what is that purpose Go Make Disciples

212
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.600
to the ends of the Earth. So discipleship is

213
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.500
not a program that occurs on Wednesday nights at

214
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.600
6:15. It's not a program that occurs on Sunday

215
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.600
nights. However, how many of your old enough to remember when we called Sunday

216
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.800
night church disciple training anyone. Anyway,

217
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.700
I see that hand. I see that hand. Yeah, you're give

218
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.800
showing your age. But but let's

219
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.500
talk a little bit about the Great Commission.

220
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.500
First of all, the the issue of authority is

221
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.400
100% settled.

222
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.500
Jesus says all authority in heaven

223
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500
and on Earth is given to me. So he is

224
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.500
King Jesus. We are citizens in

225
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.100
the kingdom of God. He's King Jesus king of

226
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.200
kings Lord of lords Prince of Peace. He is

227
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.700
our Lord and so it's not a mistake that he

228
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.000
links his perfect Authority with

229
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.100
his commission to make disciples. And

230
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.000
so we go and make disciples. But now I

231
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.000
want you to understand the context real quickly. Jesus has

232
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.100
been tortured he's been whipped.

233
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.400
Crown of Thorns bloodied cross

234
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.200
he's died. He's buried and he's risen again

235
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.300
from the grave to give victory over sin and

236
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.500
death and then you would think after having

237
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.900
accomplished all that. He would just go into Glory into heaven

238
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.700
wouldn't you but that's not what he does all

239
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.000
of the gospels record that for a month.

240
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.100
He makes appearances post Resurrection

241
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.800
appearances and he validates

242
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.200
the truth that he is the Son of God by living again,

243
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.500
but also by saying I want

244
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.000
to clearly articulate my mission

245
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.400
for my disciples and and

246
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.300
that is to make disciples. And so one thing of

247
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.500
Pastor John has been asked me to do is to help clarify what

248
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.800
what we've been calling for a long time the road map

249
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.000
to disciple making and I ask permission

250
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.800
for us to stop calling it The roadmap because

251
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.500
that's old technology. Right? We all

252
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.400
have GPS right now. So you talk

253
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.400
to your kids about a road map. They're not gonna know what you're talking about. So we're

254
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.800
gonna call it the pathway and here's the pathway really

255
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.900
quickly the worship service

256
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.400
of course is not going away. It occurs

257
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.900
on Sunday mornings and it is our largest attended assembly of

258
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.400
the week somewhere in the neighborhood of

259
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.400
1500 to 2,000 people depend.

260
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.000
which weekend and it's it's an

261
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.400
amazing thing that we get to experience, but we

262
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:55.900
also have

263
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.500
Various groups that meet for various

264
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.400
reasons last Wednesday night. We had a back to

265
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.500
school gourmet hot dog contest and I'm

266
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.700
not quite sure where that fits in

267
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.200
the Great Commission, but it was a lot of fun wasn't it?

268
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.100
But we'll have other meetings and we call

269
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.400
these equipping groups of Men's Ministry groups women's ministry groups, but

270
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.200
Sunday mornings, this is when most of our

271
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.500
people are going to attend got new technology here.

272
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.700
So we're going to see how we do. Okay, but but we're

273
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.800
going to try on Sunday mornings to push people to other

274
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.700
events, but we're not going to be satisfied with

275
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.100
just people showing up on Sunday mornings and going to our

276
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.500
big events. They may be most inclined to come to me big

277
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.400
events. But what we're trying to do is to do what to

278
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.600
push them to community groups. How many of you by rays

279
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.300
of hand are currently involved in the community group

280
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.300
raise your hand. Okay. See that's not that's not an

281
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.400
accident. We believe that the community group is where

282
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.500
you get connected relationally.

283
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.200
With a group of people who you can love and be

284
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.900
loved by whom you can invest and be invested in whom

285
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.500
you can care for and be Cared by this is

286
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.200
this is on purpose. But but what we're going to

287
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.600
do with Community groups in the coming days is we're

288
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.000
going to work at trying to have

289
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.200
a discipleship coordinator in every community

290
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.100
group that is encouraging and celebrating people

291
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.400
who get involved in what will be talking

292
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.100
about for the next 12 weeks. And that is

293
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.100
this from Community groups. We're going to ask people to try to

294
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.500
get involved in these micro groups now micro groups

295
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.900
are gender-based.

296
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.600
And they have an intentional leader.

297
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.200
And a relational environment and a reproducible process.

298
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.400
And so this is

299
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.400
going to be our sweet spot right here and I'm going to try to explain

300
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.400
why there is one-on-one and clearly one-on-one

301
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.100
is the very best feature for being able to

302
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.400
be

303
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.000
completely invested in connected with another disciple

304
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.600
maker. But but we're gonna Focus this in these

305
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.900
next 12 weeks on micro groups and the reason why and

306
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.700
again I want by the way, this is

307
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:04.900
a

308
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.400
Is important news right here? Okay. I'm not

309
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.600
going to be the only one Speaking from the platform on every Wednesday.

310
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.700
I'm doing it today because this is the first one but a

311
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.700
good discipleship process is a reproducible process.

312
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.100
And so I'm going to do this enough to wear

313
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.100
one of you is going to learn how to do this. And then you're going

314
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.900
to do it for everybody else and we're gonna celebrate the fact that you learned that

315
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.000
disciple making Essentials are an intentional

316
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.400
leader.

317
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.700
Everybody say intentional leader.

318
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.100
Not bad. I'm proud of you. All right

319
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.600
a relational environment.

320
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.300
and a reproducible process

321
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.300
All right, you fell off you started strong

322
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.000
and then you kind of died out toward the end. But let me

323
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.200
explain that a little bit. Okay, so in the large group,

324
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.600
we have a very precise and

325
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.600
well-planned day every minute

326
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.700
is planned for our worship services

327
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.500
on Sunday. Our equipping groups are also

328
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.600
planned and typically there's one speaker on

329
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.000
the platform and everyone else sitting and listening now,

330
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.500
there's not anything wrong with that but it it can't

331
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.900
be enough in the disciple making process why it's

332
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.000
a relational process.

333
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.600
It begins to occur more effectively in

334
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.200
the community groups because there's conversation. What

335
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.800
do you guys think the passage means there? How

336
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.500
can we apply this in a way? How do we pray for

337
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.300
one? Another's you begin to get into the lives of one another in our

338
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.200
community groups, but in the micro groups if they're

339
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.100
gender-based and if they're intentionally smaller if

340
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.700
there is an intentional leader, who knows what the

341
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.400
purpose of the group is and if

342
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.200
you create a relational environment and then it

343
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.400
reproduces then we have the

344
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.700
opportunity for what I

345
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.100
would consider exponential multiplication. And

346
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.400
so I just want you to see that is

347
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.000
where this pathway is headed. And what

348
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.900
are the key features of a genuine discipleship

349
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.900
experience? Well, they're right here a it's relational.

350
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.600
B it's transparent

351
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.600
What does that mean? That means that I'm going to let you in to

352
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.400
who feels fully really is when I stand up

353
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.100
in front of people on Sundays. You don't get to

354
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.700
see everything there is to know about feel because frankly,

355
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.200
I'm not telling you and you don't want to know

356
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.300
right but if I can trust a group

357
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.000
of men who I know care for me whose purpose

358
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.500
is to develop me spiritually, then I

359
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.800
might be more honest with some things that I'm struggling with to the

360
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.100
point of vulnerability. I'm gonna tell you what

361
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.900
my weaknesses are so that you can encourage me.

362
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.300
So that you can challenge me and

363
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.800
ultimately you can hold me accountable.

364
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.500
the ultimate

365
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.100
goal

366
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.500
for disciple making is genuine spiritual intimacy.

367
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.100
Now. Let me talk to the

368
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.800
men for a minute. I'm a baby boomer. If

369
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.200
you're a millennial, I apologize for the

370
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.600
way we've treated you for all these years. But what we've

371
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.200
done is Baby Boomers is we've decided that it's the

372
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.500
tough guy that wins and the

373
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.100
tough guy is the guy that stands remote and aloof and

374
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.600
never gets hurt. My generation can be hammering a

375
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.400
nail and hit our thumb.

376
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.300
And say man, that's smarts.

377
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.900
You know when we're alone, that's not what we say. All

378
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.500
right, right. We we scream and we cry and

379
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.700
we jump and we there might be a curse word probably

380
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.000
not but maybe right so but

381
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.700
but when we're transparent and when we're vulnerable and

382
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.600
when we're intimate, we don't mind letting people in to

383
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.200
see who we are. So let's let's here's my last.

384
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.900
Example the larger the

385
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.600
group. This is like an X Y axis the

386
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.400
larger the group the smaller the opportunity

387
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.000
for intimacy.

388
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.900
And accountability and conversation

389
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.200
as a matter of fact on Sunday. If you guys

390
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.800
decide to have a conversation during Pastor John sermon the Usher

391
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.800
will escort you out right but but

392
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.400
watch what happens as the group begins to

393
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.600
grow smaller, then the opportunities for

394
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.200
transparency and conversation and intimacy

395
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.200
and accountability continues to grow.

396
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.500
So what we're going to work at doing at Henderson Hills

397
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.500
Church is pushing men into men's group

398
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.200
and women into women's groups so that they

399
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.600
can experience genuine intimacy.

400
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.600
And what does that look like?

401
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.200
Well, that looks like conversations.

402
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.100
And that looks like a transparency.

403
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.000
And that looks like vulnerability. And by the

404
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.400
way vulnerability is not something that is easy.

405
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.700
I'm gonna go ahead and write accountability so I don't forget it. Okay, but

406
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.400
I I just want you to be I want

407
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.000
you to understand doesn't come easy to me either.

408
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.500
All right, is it I wasn't raised by Alan Alda, you

409
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.000
know to to cry every time there was

410
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.300
a Sentimental moment on television some of you are too young

411
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.300
to know who Alan Alda is he was the very first man who cried on

412
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.100
TV or something like that out of it anyway Mash anyway.

413
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.400
It's doesn't come easy for me. My wife and

414
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.200
I've been married 42 years and she will tell you that I

415
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.800
have somewhere in the neighborhood of six to

416
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.700
eight hundred words a day.

417
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.500
All right. She on the other hand has six.

418
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.200
Thousand to 8,000 words a day. And and

419
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.500
so what will she's always trying to draw me

420
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.200
out and she's in she'll encourage me like a cheerleader. Come

421
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.900
on Phil stay with me and I'm just like, oh, please

422
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.900
leave me alone. Right? I want

423
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.000
you to know that's who I am really, but but

424
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.300
I know that I need to be in a group

425
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.600
of men who can know me.

426
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.100
Who can challenge me? I've been

427
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.400
in enough discipleship groups and we've grown close enough

428
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.300
together that I can tell

429
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.400
by the look on your face, whether you're full of the Holy Spirit or you've

430
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.300
grieved the Holy Spirit.

431
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.100
And it's it's a good thing. You're like, oh, I

432
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.500
don't I don't I really need people not to know that about me.

433
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.600
Right, but it no it's a good thing and if you want to grow in your

434
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.700
faith in Christ, then you're going to be willing to to focus

435
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.700
on this this sweet spot. We

436
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.700
call this The Sweet Spot and it is

437
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.700
probably the most difficult spot to

438
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.800
ascend.

439
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.200
What's going to happen next? All right is we've talked

440
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.500
about the pathway, right? We've talked about the essentials.

441
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.700
What is the essentials and intentional leader? I

442
00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.500
want to go back to that for a minute. My prayer

443
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.700
is is that everyone in this room?

444
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.900
Will one day eventually be an intentional

445
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.700
leader of a micro group.

446
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.000
Okay, and some of you are already saying.

447
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.700
I'm out.

448
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.100
I'm not going to do that. Right and I

449
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.500
just want you to be I want you to be sensitive to

450
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.400
to the reality that this might be

451
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.300
what God is calling me to do. I may

452
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.500
not be ready yet.

453
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.600
But one day I pray that I will be ready. Okay, and

454
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.100
the best way for us to do this and I want

455
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.100
to be very empathetic the best way for us to

456
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.600
do this is to begin to practice immediately. Okay. So

457
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.200
what does that mean?

458
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.400
I got a great story and we're 13 minutes

459
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.300
over already. So you'll have to subtract your

460
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.200
time from your micro group. But what does

461
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.300
that mean?

462
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:55.600
Okay.

463
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.400
In a moment. I'm going to ask several of you who I

464
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.500
know are disciple making leaders to

465
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.100
stand.

466
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.900
And what not yet when you

467
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.700
stand I'm going to ask that you just kind of find a spot

468
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.700
around the perimeter. Okay. It looks

469
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.100
like we may have about 250 people

470
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.900
here tonight. And if you do the math if that

471
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.500
was 300 people, that would be about 75 quads.

472
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.300
I don't know if that's right or

473
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.900
not, but it's close.

474
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.700
All right. We probably have more

475
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.000
we we need more leaders. It's

476
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.200
like oh no, it's a huge failure and fill as

477
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.200
a complete flop move back to Texas. No really.

478
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.800
We all what we're

479
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.400
going to need in these causes for someone to say well, I'll

480
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.000
be the leader tonight.

481
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.300
He said well, I don't think I'm trained.

482
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.400
Compare your training with that of the the original

483
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.200
disciples.

484
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.900
Right what what training had they been through?

485
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.800
All they did was hang out with Jesus for about three years.

486
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.900
Right, they'd not been to Seminary they'd not been to didn't

487
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.300
have graduate degrees. They had not really ever been trained

488
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.700
by Phil sleigh School of disciple making 101, you

489
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.900
know, they didn't have a lot of training but they just decided

490
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.700
that we are going to invest in one another and

491
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.100
we're going to do life together and then we're gonna

492
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.500
reproduce that in groups Beyond to the

493
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.400
ends of the Earth and they did and here we are on the other side

494
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:26.900
of the Earth.

495
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.000
somehow in between that model

496
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.000
and where we are today, we turn discipleship

497
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.900
into kind of a program.

498
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.300
And what I'm asking you to do is to think with me

499
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.100
could this be a lifelong process where

500
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.600
I'm investing my life into

501
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.300
the lives of others and I want

502
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.300
to finish this story then we'll bust real quick. So this was

503
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.200
my last estopship group This Is Us actually sitting

504
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.300
in the dirtiest IHOP in the Dallas

505
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.200
metro area. We loved it because there was no

506
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.500
one there and so we always got right in and but

507
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.400
one morning this guy right here,

508
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.400
his name is David Bailey shows up

509
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.800
and David announces to us. His marriage is over and he

510
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.500
gives us lots of reasons why and he

511
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.600
takes 45 minutes to explain it. He ruined the

512
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.400
entire morning.

513
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.300
Okay, and we're all sitting there looking at each other like man. This

514
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.000
was a waste of time.

515
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.200
Well David would come and go and he would come and go

516
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.100
and he he came back one morning. And he

517
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.500
said this he said guys at

518
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.500
the end and we'll do that again tonight at

519
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.100
the end. You have prayer time together we ask how can we pray for

520
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.100
one another and David said I need you to pray for me because something's going

521
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.400
on. I don't understand it. So what do you mean? He said? Well,

522
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.400
I could never get my wife to go to church with me. That

523
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.000
was one of the reasons why I figured like I needed to divorce her.

524
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.200
and he

525
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.900
he said Sunday. I'm sitting in church by myself and

526
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.700
she texts me. Where are you sitting and she

527
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.300
came in and she sit next to me and she held my

528
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:04.500
hand.

529
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.100
He's like what am I supposed to do that?

530
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.000
And he said that night he says I'm staying upstairs. She's

531
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.600
staying downstairs and master bedroom. I hear the master bedroom open and

532
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.200
then I hear somebody coming up the stairs and I frankly I'm

533
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:20.800
hoping it's her.

534
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.900
It was my three-year-old.

535
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.400
Which is this little guy right here Sloan?

536
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.100
And Sloan stands at the doorway and all I can see is

537
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.400
her silhouette and she just stands there and he doesn't

538
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.100
know what to say.

539
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.100
Finally after about two minutes. She goes. I love

540
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.500
you, Daddy.

541
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.200
He said I love you. Sloaney and Sloan went back down got in

542
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.600
bed with Mom.

543
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.200
And David turns and he goes, I don't

544
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.900
know what this means.

545
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.700
maybe God is

546
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.300
want me to get back with my wife and and some

547
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.800
of us are going like yeah, duh. I mean come on

548
00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.900
you the head with the two before?

549
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.700
And but listen to this at that exact moment right

550
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.900
next to him Rusty Wallace, that's Rusty

551
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.100
right there.

552
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.300
Rusty says David from the very first day you started

553
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.200
coming to our discipleship group. I pray that God would reconcile your

554
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.500
marriage.

555
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.700
I said David if you and your wife will come in and see me for marital counseling.

556
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.700
We'll pray for you and we will help you one day restore your

557
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.100
marriage.

558
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.000
And then we'll come to your wedding.

559
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.100
And guess what?

560
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.900
About six months later. I've been seeing them every other Sunday about

561
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.100
six months later. He goes. Hey,

562
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.700
On Sunday, we're doing counseling right because yeah, he's our we're gonna do that culture for

563
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.600
appreciation thing. You do every week. I said, yeah. We are he goes.

564
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.300
Well, I'm gonna ask her to marry me see why we

565
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.800
were being while we were counseling while we were discipling. They

566
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.500
had pre-purchased a divorce.

567
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.200
Package from a lawyer and they'd gotten

568
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:54.700
divorced.

569
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.600
But still they were committed to changing to transforming

570
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.600
to becoming Disciples of Jesus and he falls

571
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.400
on his knees and my office invites her who are to this

572
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.100
opship and this is their wedding and I just want to see this little group of

573
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.600
men right here. That's the discipleship group and we're in the we're in

574
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.600
the pit of covid. There's only about a dozen people there and there's

575
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.900
five of us from the discipleship group. And so there's

576
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.600
a there's David and his sweet

577
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.400
wife and they're two babies and God save their

578
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.800
marriage and they're still growing and still meeting every Tuesday

579
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.200
morning at 6:30 for this hour ship and

580
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.100
one day David will be leading his own discipleship group and you

581
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.600
don't tell me that that's not something that God gets excited about

582
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.700
so I think he wants to do that over and over again in our

583
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.300
own lives Okay, so

584
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.100
What's going to happen next? I'm just talk to you about courage and boldness.

585
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:46.300
All right.

586
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.400
Pastor Phil is going to ask you to find

587
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.300
a micro group of people in this

588
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.900
room men with men and women with women and

589
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.100
some of you're saying if I had known he was

590
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.700
going to do this. I would not have come.

591
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.700
Okay, and I'm I want

592
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.200
to say two things. First of all, I'm sorry.

593
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.600
And secondly, I'm not sorry. Okay, because the

594
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.900
hardest things

595
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.300
Are often the best things?

596
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.200
And if this is where we're moving then we're going to have to

597
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.700
say I'm going to I'm gonna put my big boy pants on tonight and

598
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.100
I'm gonna find a group and I'm gonna sit down with them and we're gonna start

599
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.200
discussing things and I'm going to have to participate I

600
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.400
would just much rather. Listen to Phil tell

601
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.500
funny stories, right? That's not discipleship.

602
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.500
And that's not going to progress our dream and

603
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.800
our vision of becoming a disciple making movement. So

604
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.700
are you ready?

605
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.500
Oh, wow. That was yeah. Yeah.

606
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.200
This is a man with a

607
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.800
very clear guilty conscience. And so thank you. I'm proud

608
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.300
of you. All right. So if you are a if

609
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.200
you are have been discipled and you

610
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.500
know what I'm talking about and you're excited about leading a

611
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.900
micro group in here on Wednesday nights at

612
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.300
during the second half of what we do together. We're gonna

613
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.900
have that you go ahead and stand men and women. All right, go ahead and stand.

614
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.100
All right.

615
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.600
Okay more men than women. I'd like to I'd like

616
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.300
to point that out. We're gonna need more women leaders. And so if

617
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.900
you leaders would kind of move towards the the

618
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.900
outskirts of this room. All right, watch them

619
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.200
walk. And if you see somebody that you know,

620
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.500
Then you're gonna in a minute gonna want to hurry to their group.

621
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.400
Okay, because when there's

622
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.900
four in their group, then you're going to have to find another group. All

623
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.700
right, so

624
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.100
Next what I'm going to do is I'm going to say go where

625
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.700
you feel. I'm gonna say something else.

626
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.400
This is awkward.

627
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.200
But it won't be awkward when you're the intentional leader

628
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.600
because you will be inviting people to be a part of your group and

629
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.300
you're going to invite people from your community group or from

630
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.000
people in your sphere of influence. You're gonna know them you're gonna

631
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.000
have prayed that God would lead you to them. So this is awkward right now.

632
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.100
It won't be that awkward later. But right now it's awkward. I know

633
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.800
that it's awkward, but what you're gonna see in

634
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.200
the next

635
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.200
12 weeks. This is an intensive, which

636
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.000
means it's not going to be 12 months. It's going to be 12 weeks. But

637
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.500
what you're going to see is this brand new

638
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.300
awkward micro group is going to kind of

639
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.500
bond together and fall in love with one another at

640
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.100
the end of the 12 weeks. It's over. Okay. This is not a group

641
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.400
that continues go on right but right now it's

642
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.800
going to be awkward, but you'll see how the Holy Spirit bonds and

643
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.500
unites the hearts of Those who commit to

644
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.700
growing in the image of Christ. And so next what a

645
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.400
life for you to do is to stand up and find

646
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.500
again, these are gender-based.

647
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.100
And so if you're a go to it, if you're a female go to

648
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.100
a female leader, if your male go to a male leader, if you

649
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.400
can't find a female leader, then guess what you're the new

650
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.500
leader of that group. All right.

651
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.500
So let's find a spot.
