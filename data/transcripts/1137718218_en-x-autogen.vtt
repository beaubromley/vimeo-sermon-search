00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:04.405
Yeah, so church, it is a joy every time we get to do this,

2
00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:06.365
whether it's the beginning or the end, we had a

3
00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:09.685
baptism in the first service as well, one

4
00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:10.805
of our high school boys.

5
00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:12.965
And so we're thankful that God is continuing to work.

6
00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:14.525
And so we get to celebrate this

7
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:16.965
because it's a picture of salvation in

8
00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:18.525
what God's done in someone's life.

9
00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:21.885
And so we get to celebrate with the leveraged family today.

10
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:26.685
This is Claire, and she's coming to be There you go.

11
00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:28.285
They're on the front row. We said that. Yep.

12
00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:33.965
So we are praising God for what he has done in her life as,

13
00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:36.885
uh, the family points their kids to Jesus.

14
00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:39.805
The church comes alongside and helps do that as well.

15
00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.445
And she's just come to that place to see

16
00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:44.325
that she needs a savior and has confessed him as Lord been

17
00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:46.445
transformed from the inside out.

18
00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:49.525
This today is a picture of that in obedience to

19
00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:50.845
what Jesus commanded to do.

20
00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:53.485
And so because of your profession of faith, I get

21
00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:55.365
to baptize you in the name of the Father,

22
00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:56.805
son and Holy Spirit.

23
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:07.245
Yep. Let's pray. Let's pray. God, thank you for Claire.

24
00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:09.485
Thank you for the, the work you've done in her life.

25
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:12.805
That this picture of death to life, of burial,

26
00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:13.845
to resurrection is

27
00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:16.965
what you've done already in her heart forever.

28
00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.605
Thank you for that, and I pray that you continue

29
00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:21.325
to push her forward towards you.

30
00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:26.485
Draw her heart to faith more every day, to deep obedience,

31
00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:29.365
more every day, to trust you in the hard times,

32
00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:34.005
more every day, to see the goodness of God more every day.

33
00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:37.205
Help us as a church to do that well, as her parents

34
00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:39.565
and others around and her family do that.

35
00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:41.925
Lord, I pray that you would use her life

36
00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:43.445
for your glory in huge ways.

37
00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:45.485
In Jesus' name, amen.

38
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.405
Amen. Amen. You may.
