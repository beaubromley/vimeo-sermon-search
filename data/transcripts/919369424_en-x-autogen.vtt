WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:02.645
Okay, week five.

2
00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:07.845
Um, thought I'd begin tonight by just seeing if anybody,

3
00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:12.485
um, would be willing to just share something

4
00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:17.165
that you got out of either week fives material

5
00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:18.325
or week four.

6
00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:24.125
Just anybody have a takeaway from either

7
00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:25.845
of those past two weeks?

8
00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:29.245
We're gonna go over the material in week five,

9
00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:33.605
somewhat tonight, but just in case just kind of wondering

10
00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:38.165
what, if there's anything that's kind of speaking to you.

11
00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.925
And no shame if there isn't. Uh,

12
00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:45.605
We, we five that's we're Now, right? Yes. Yeah. It

13
00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.245
Didn't seem like it really flowed the way the other

14
00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:50.125
lessons have, at least to us.

15
00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.805
Yeah. It seemed like it jumped around a lot.

16
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:58.085
It actually has two major focuses,

17
00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:01.205
or folk, I, whatever, you know, you say that.

18
00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:06.565
Um, one being condemnation, emptying your cups

19
00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:07.605
of condemnation.

20
00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:10.645
And then the other is sexual intimacy in marriage.

21
00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.245
So that might've been part of that. I'm not sure.

22
00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:16.285
Like there was,

23
00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:19.485
I think two days and sexual

24
00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:21.085
intimacy was right in the middle.

25
00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.165
And then we go up and pick up another topic.

26
00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:26.325
Yeah. Yeah. It, it kind of does that.

27
00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:29.525
I think this is the first time it's really had two major

28
00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:30.725
topics, Uhhuh,

29
00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:35.885
but, um, it always has some days that are more about, uh,

30
00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:39.765
your, your relationship or, uh, intimacy with Jesus.

31
00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:44.125
Um, and then other days that are more specifically on

32
00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:46.645
a relationship as a couple, so

33
00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:48.125
that there's a little bouncing around

34
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.565
that's intentional every week.

35
00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.045
But I think it probably added to that

36
00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:56.565
because they had two days on sexual intimacy

37
00:01:56.565 --> 00:01:59.325
and two days on, or three

38
00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:01.805
or four days that would've been on condemnation.

39
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:06.045
So I'm, I'm gonna try to cover both of those areas. Okay.

40
00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:11.125
Uh, before I do that, anybody else want to share anything?

41
00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:14.325
I like the, Go

42
00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:15.325
Ahead. I like the thought

43
00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:18.885
in, um, the one Corinthians 13

44
00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:22.045
and changing out the name, our names for love.

45
00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:24.445
Yeah. I actually took that and wrote it on our mirror

46
00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:26.725
because that made an impact for me.

47
00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:28.765
I feel like that was something that I could kind

48
00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:30.805
of grab hold of and kind

49
00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:34.165
of remind myself throughout the day, am I doing this

50
00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:35.915
Good? So

51
00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:37.445
I, I really enjoyed that part

52
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:38.445
Of it. Yeah.

53
00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:41.525
If I could build off that, um,

54
00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.525
uh, back when I was a younger man

55
00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:47.725
and had hair, uh, I was in seminary

56
00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:51.285
and I had, I took a class on spiritual formation, which was

57
00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.845
probably my most memorable class of three years

58
00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:56.445
of schooling there.

59
00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:02.005
And, uh, one of the things that the, uh, professor

60
00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:06.525
of that class did was, he had us go through Psalms

61
00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:10.805
on our own, but he said, replace your name,

62
00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:16.005
um, as if you're David writing those psalms.

63
00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:19.605
So read it or even read it out loud,

64
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:22.605
but personalize it, make it first person.

65
00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:26.445
And that really did make a difference.

66
00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:29.965
And you reminded me of that as you said that, so

67
00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:32.925
Very good, very good way to apply that.

68
00:03:35.325 --> 00:03:36.325
Anybody else?

69
00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:39.855
I was gonna say back to week four, so one

70
00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:42.455
of the things I've struggled with for 20 plus years

71
00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:46.615
of marriage is the trying to fix everything.

72
00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:48.415
Right? Like, that's my job. Mm-Hmm.

73
00:03:48.835 --> 00:03:50.455
Day to day, that's what I do. I'm a fixer.

74
00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:53.135
I I manage things and have done it for years and years.

75
00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:56.775
And so it's really hard for me to just sit and listen

76
00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.575
and sit and mourn with her and Mm-Hmm.

77
00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:03.855
You know, feel her feelings when that's not

78
00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:05.135
what she wants for sure.

79
00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:07.615
But even more, that's not what she needs. Mm-Hmm.

80
00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:10.575
And so we, we had a really good conversation on, okay,

81
00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:12.095
how do I get them past that?

82
00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:13.455
And, you know,

83
00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:16.095
because there's still that time as we talked, even

84
00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:20.415
for weeks on the, um, uh, you know, speaking the truth

85
00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:21.455
and love Mm-Hmm.

86
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.775
And, you know, it's, I still find myself challenging

87
00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:26.575
to bite my tongue and,

88
00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:28.975
and hopefully getting to the point of I'm not having

89
00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:30.775
to fight that in my own mind

90
00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:35.255
because I'm already seeing that's not even what I should be

91
00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:37.575
focusing on to begin with. Mm-Hmm.

92
00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:40.255
And that's a great takeaway.

93
00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:46.255
Uh, high five, right, Carrie? Uh, very helpful. Yes.

94
00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:50.215
Yeah. And it's, uh, it is so common,

95
00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:52.855
not exclusively to men,

96
00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:58.015
but probably more likely that we'll see ourselves

97
00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:01.255
as fixers and doers and so forth.

98
00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:04.175
Well, I think we also, I mean, the question

99
00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:07.415
that you asked me, 'cause he was like, how do I know when

100
00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:10.015
to say I think you should do this

101
00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:11.575
versus, I'm just gonna listen.

102
00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:15.295
So we had a whole discussion on like, what would

103
00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:16.495
that look like, Uhhuh, like

104
00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:18.335
Did you, did you figure that Out?

105
00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:19.655
Yeah, we decided we'd come up with like,

106
00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:21.215
just continue these meetings.

107
00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:23.295
Like, that would be the time that I'm saying, Hey,

108
00:05:23.535 --> 00:05:25.855
I need you to help me fix this, versus I need you

109
00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:26.855
To listen.

110
00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:30.455
And I mean, just verbally saying that instead

111
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.575
of having expectations or Yeah.

112
00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:34.615
Um, not feeling heard,

113
00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:38.295
but just, um, so he knows too, like, how,

114
00:05:38.475 --> 00:05:39.735
how can he help me in that way?

115
00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:40.855
And how can I help him? And

116
00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:42.495
how can we communicate better things?

117
00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:43.695
Yeah. It was really good.

118
00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:46.975
You know, uh, the mentor

119
00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:51.455
that you've seen David Ferguson on these, uh, videos, uh,

120
00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:56.335
helped us, uh, also see that

121
00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:00.525
as almost a general problem in our culture as well

122
00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:03.445
as most cultures in the world, which is we have a being

123
00:06:03.995 --> 00:06:06.285
with issue.

124
00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:12.325
We struggle to be with people where we're really connecting

125
00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:15.885
emotionally, psychologically, relationally.

126
00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:20.645
So we can do things and we can fix problems

127
00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:22.325
and that kind of deal.

128
00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:27.005
But it is hard, especially if that wasn't part of

129
00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:30.805
what you experienced on a regular daily, weekly basis

130
00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:32.685
in your young years.

131
00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:35.285
'cause that's where you're just absorbing everything,

132
00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:37.605
whatever's there is what you're absorbing.

133
00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:40.525
Right. In my home, as I've said

134
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:43.125
before, it was overall very good family

135
00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:45.205
and very stable and all that.

136
00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:50.085
But we did not discuss emotions ever

137
00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:53.485
just wasn't on the agenda.

138
00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:57.765
So you learn by experience.

139
00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:00.925
Um, if I'm feeling something I'm,

140
00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:03.485
maybe I shouldn't be feeling something, you know?

141
00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:06.245
So you just learn to not communicate it.

142
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:11.205
Uh, and definitely if somebody starts crying

143
00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:16.605
in my presence and I'm married to her, if that were

144
00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:19.285
to happen, that makes me doubly anxious

145
00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:23.485
because now that looks like a problem to me.

146
00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:27.125
And in a way it is. But I just had

147
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:28.445
to learn the very same thing.

148
00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:33.195
And my mid forties was the best thing to do is

149
00:07:33.195 --> 00:07:38.035
what the Bible says to do, which is be with her hurting,

150
00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:41.885
with her mourning, with her tuning in

151
00:07:41.885 --> 00:07:44.725
with her emotions rather than trying

152
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:47.525
to take it somewhere else as a diversion.

153
00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:51.005
And if I could add one thing, we, we, uh,

154
00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:54.725
we were talking earlier about a, um, a train we had earlier,

155
00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:57.685
and one of the things that came up was that the,

156
00:07:57.785 --> 00:08:00.005
the opposite almost of being with Mm-Hmm.

157
00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:03.365
Is being around. And I think so often we kind

158
00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:05.085
of put into our minds where we're with them,

159
00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:07.005
but we're not, we're just around them.

160
00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:10.805
And, uh, you know, keeping that as a mindset of that has

161
00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:15.085
to be the difference of I'm not just around you, I'm

162
00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:17.485
with you, and what the different things

163
00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:20.045
that can mean and how we do that. So

164
00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:21.795
Yeah. Even if we just think

165
00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:25.205
about something that's not sinful,

166
00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:27.885
unless you're watching really bad stuff or something,

167
00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:29.325
but if you're watching TV together

168
00:08:29.985 --> 00:08:31.165
now, that's not a bad thing.

169
00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:34.485
Right. Uh, we had a great time watching

170
00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:37.605
sports this weekend together,

171
00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:43.765
but that rarely accomplishes being with, that's good,

172
00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:45.565
but it's not the same.

173
00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:50.885
And we need this be with me, see my heart, understand me,

174
00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:56.085
um, be, be, uh,

175
00:08:57.785 --> 00:09:00.285
caring for me rather than managing me.

176
00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:04.765
So, good takeaways. Yeah.

177
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:08.485
If you've got nothing outta this class, then that, uh,

178
00:09:08.555 --> 00:09:12.805
that would probably, uh, uh, be a great investment

179
00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:17.045
of your time already. Anybody else?

180
00:09:18.005 --> 00:09:22.085
I would add, I'd say that I would say had to as well, um,

181
00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:23.885
connect with that in the sense that

182
00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:25.965
in my childhood growing up,

183
00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:27.365
my parents divorced when I was young,

184
00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:28.525
and then they remarried later on

185
00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:31.805
and out of, so I don't remember

186
00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:33.565
as much from the early childhood

187
00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:36.245
and it wasn't a healthy spot anyways,

188
00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:40.885
but the older marriages, the best out of both

189
00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:44.125
of those was the marriage where my stepfather said that

190
00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:47.485
he liked my, my mom being with,

191
00:09:48.105 --> 00:09:51.245
and he just met in the same household, Uhhuh with her.

192
00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:53.005
And so that was the closest thing

193
00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:54.605
that I saw for the most part.

194
00:09:54.605 --> 00:09:56.405
Yeah. To connection. Yeah.

195
00:09:56.505 --> 00:09:59.365
Uh, other than occasionally we would go on a family vacation

196
00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:03.925
or something like that, but, um, it was like, that was what,

197
00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:08.205
that was the depth of what he under it seemed to me like.

198
00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:09.965
Mm-Hmm. From my view at least, that

199
00:10:09.965 --> 00:10:11.085
that was probably the depth of

200
00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:12.765
what he understood of being with.

201
00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:15.885
Right. Um, and he was on his third marriage

202
00:10:16.025 --> 00:10:17.685
and different things, but yeah.

203
00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:21.645
Um, so I don't think that I really, and I,

204
00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:22.885
and I've talked to my wife about that.

205
00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:24.965
I like her being with me Mm-Hmm.

206
00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:27.165
With different activities where they're working on something

207
00:10:27.165 --> 00:10:28.845
or playing or vacation or whatever.

208
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:30.925
I don't care. I like her being with me. Yeah.

209
00:10:31.345 --> 00:10:34.565
Um, but I would like the more also mm-Hmm.

210
00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:37.805
So, but anyways, it's just interesting. Great.

211
00:10:38.155 --> 00:10:42.565
When you haven't seen the other, it's hard to, it's hard to

212
00:10:43.585 --> 00:10:45.365
figure out how to get to something you've never

213
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:46.565
really understood.

214
00:10:46.785 --> 00:10:47.785
So, Mm-Hmm.

215
00:10:48.865 --> 00:10:51.005
That's really good. Yeah.

216
00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:53.605
I bet you there's others in the room

217
00:10:53.605 --> 00:10:56.485
that could probably relate directly to some of

218
00:10:56.485 --> 00:10:58.845
that in different details. But, uh,

219
00:10:58.945 --> 00:11:01.285
And for that he, your comfort

220
00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:03.205
that he never got

221
00:11:05.945 --> 00:11:08.125
and see you. Interesting.

222
00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:11.805
So I'm just gonna repeat what Joyce said, make sure

223
00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:16.485
that it's picked up on here, that that's anytime

224
00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:21.645
needs that God wanted met for us growing up, such as empathy

225
00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:24.605
and compassion, comfort, encouragement,

226
00:11:24.825 --> 00:11:29.325
if those weren't met, that's another memory

227
00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:32.965
that may be waiting for some of God's comfort.

228
00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:37.085
And his comfort is not a pep talk. It is.

229
00:11:37.605 --> 00:11:40.125
I care that you did not have that,

230
00:11:41.965 --> 00:11:46.145
and maybe even, and I think I can even try harder

231
00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:49.185
to give that to you as we go forward.

232
00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:51.825
In other words, I'm gonna learn from

233
00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:52.985
this if I haven't already.

234
00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:56.365
Hope for the future. Hope for the future. Yeah. Mm-Hmm.

235
00:11:57.465 --> 00:12:00.885
Um, one of the things that's implied in many

236
00:12:00.885 --> 00:12:05.565
of these weeks is, uh, the need that we might have

237
00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:07.405
for change or growth

238
00:12:09.105 --> 00:12:10.765
in our ability to love.

239
00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:12.125
Well, okay.

240
00:12:12.505 --> 00:12:13.645
And I sure hope, in fact,

241
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:15.245
we're gonna talk about condemnation night.

242
00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:17.445
Don't be going around beating yourself up.

243
00:12:17.815 --> 00:12:20.525
Especially if it wasn't like, well,

244
00:12:20.525 --> 00:12:22.805
I just don't really think I care, and

245
00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:25.525
therefore I'm just not going to give to this relationship.

246
00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:27.605
That would be more of an attitude

247
00:12:27.605 --> 00:12:29.005
that needs changing, right?

248
00:12:29.105 --> 00:12:33.245
Mm-Hmm. But oftentimes it's inadequacy. Join the club.

249
00:12:34.825 --> 00:12:36.605
Um, even

250
00:12:36.605 --> 00:12:39.805
after I was trained to be a counselor, I had not learned how

251
00:12:39.805 --> 00:12:42.685
to, uh, communicate with my wife's heart.

252
00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:44.965
Now that's really scary.

253
00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.925
If you're her, you know,

254
00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:48.725
he's even got a counseling degree now,

255
00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:51.885
and I still wasn't communicating with her heart.

256
00:12:53.635 --> 00:12:57.535
And, uh, there was a need for awareness

257
00:12:58.125 --> 00:12:59.255
that I need to grow.

258
00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:03.335
And secondly, there was a need for effort to make

259
00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:06.335
that growth, to kind of get on board with

260
00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:07.495
what the Lord was doing.

261
00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:11.135
So, more good comments.

262
00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:15.975
So realize this, this blushy, this comfort thing,

263
00:13:17.675 --> 00:13:21.095
uh, which is so foreign to many of us as far as

264
00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:22.335
what we were exposed to,

265
00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:25.415
or what we've experienced, even sometimes in marriage,

266
00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:28.015
like we had not experienced it.

267
00:13:28.755 --> 00:13:32.855
Um, this is almost a daily opportunity,

268
00:13:33.035 --> 00:13:34.175
either in marriage

269
00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:36.695
or in other encounters you have

270
00:13:36.695 --> 00:13:37.975
with other people during the day.

271
00:13:38.805 --> 00:13:40.815
It's all around us that people are hurting.

272
00:13:41.835 --> 00:13:45.695
So we just want to equip the saints for the work of

273
00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:48.055
that ministry starting at home,

274
00:13:48.835 --> 00:13:51.335
and then be ready for the people around you.

275
00:13:52.755 --> 00:13:56.335
So, okay, let me pray for us,

276
00:13:56.475 --> 00:13:59.615
and then I'm gonna give you a little talking

277
00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:00.775
assignment as a couple.

278
00:14:02.155 --> 00:14:05.615
Father, be with us today, uh, as we just continue

279
00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:09.295
to reflect on the word, the instruction, the guidance

280
00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:12.535
that you have given us about how to love, like Jesus loves,

281
00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:17.975
uh, how to give first and, uh,

282
00:14:19.795 --> 00:14:22.495
and speak truth in love,

283
00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:26.935
but also, um, create safe places

284
00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:30.775
for our spouses to share with us what they're thinking,

285
00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:32.455
what they're feeling, what they're needing.

286
00:14:33.835 --> 00:14:37.095
Um, and we know your, your Holy Spirit,

287
00:14:38.285 --> 00:14:41.135
your already active in us

288
00:14:42.245 --> 00:14:44.335
because it's, it's a gift from you.

289
00:14:45.075 --> 00:14:48.015
So let us just respond to the nudges

290
00:14:48.015 --> 00:14:50.575
that we get from the Spirit in Jesus' name.

291
00:14:50.955 --> 00:14:55.005
Amen. So, um,

292
00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:02.405
uh, Couple of thoughts.

293
00:15:02.405 --> 00:15:04.205
We're gonna talk about condemnation first.

294
00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:09.285
And, um, I'm gonna show you a

295
00:15:10.055 --> 00:15:13.725
video of Dr. Ferguson doing another meditation.

296
00:15:14.275 --> 00:15:17.445
Okay? This one's coming out of Romans eight,

297
00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:22.245
so you'll probably be very familiar with the verse.

298
00:15:22.465 --> 00:15:25.925
Romans eight, one that says, there is now,

299
00:15:26.515 --> 00:15:29.605
therefore no condemnation

300
00:15:30.225 --> 00:15:31.645
for those who are in Christ Jesus.

301
00:15:32.755 --> 00:15:35.365
Basically saying, if you have put your trust in Christ,

302
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.325
receive him into your heart.

303
00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:41.365
Um, he has made an eternal home for you

304
00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:46.445
that he is not the one responsible it

305
00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:50.285
for you feeling condemnation if you're still feeling it.

306
00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:53.365
It's not coming from him according to that verse.

307
00:15:54.395 --> 00:15:58.245
It's coming from tapes, memories, patterns

308
00:15:58.245 --> 00:16:00.885
of thoughts that you may have had.

309
00:16:01.945 --> 00:16:06.325
And it's not coming from him, but they may still be there.

310
00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:11.045
And we would love for them to not be there to

311
00:16:11.045 --> 00:16:13.365
where those thoughts, those feelings

312
00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:16.165
that come from those thoughts are not haunting

313
00:16:16.165 --> 00:16:18.645
you on a regular basis. If that makes sense.

314
00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.285
Can I add something? Sure.

315
00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:24.765
And for a long time, until I understood what condemnation,

316
00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:29.925
how it could come into our lives, yours came from me.

317
00:16:31.275 --> 00:16:33.805
What you might, you might already say what you mean. Yeah.

318
00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:37.525
Well, like, I was quite, I was never satisfied,

319
00:16:37.865 --> 00:16:40.245
or you got home too late again,

320
00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:42.605
or, you know, stuff like that.

321
00:16:43.225 --> 00:16:45.485
And that just makes you feel inadequate.

322
00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:50.365
Yeah. And we, we had that awareness of

323
00:16:50.365 --> 00:16:51.525
that part of our dynamic.

324
00:16:52.265 --> 00:16:55.605
At that same point in our relationship, about 19 years in,

325
00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:57.765
we were both about 45.

326
00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:02.765
And then I think I've already shared how I would leave her

327
00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.365
needing to talk and I'd be saying,

328
00:17:06.575 --> 00:17:08.845
don't have time or something like that.

329
00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:10.205
I was leaving her abandoned.

330
00:17:10.385 --> 00:17:13.605
So we both had things that we were coming to be aware of.

331
00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:17.325
And, uh, but it wouldn't have helped

332
00:17:19.385 --> 00:17:23.645
if I continued to scratch that sore on her arm,

333
00:17:23.745 --> 00:17:27.045
or she continues to step on the bruise

334
00:17:27.875 --> 00:17:30.765
that I have from the condemnation I got growing up.

335
00:17:31.105 --> 00:17:32.645
So coming to be aware of that,

336
00:17:32.665 --> 00:17:36.925
and then having tools for how do we respond instead. So,

337
00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:40.285
And it helps to know the personality

338
00:17:40.505 --> 00:17:42.085
of your spouse versus you.

339
00:17:42.845 --> 00:17:44.325
'cause like, I didn't gather

340
00:17:44.385 --> 00:17:46.805
as much condemnation from my parents,

341
00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:49.525
because when my mom would say, oh, you can't do that,

342
00:17:49.925 --> 00:17:51.605
I would say, well, you just hide and watch.

343
00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:55.765
Yeah. Have you noticed a little personality difference

344
00:17:55.765 --> 00:17:57.805
between you bet

345
00:17:58.715 --> 00:18:01.805
That you, you would go, oh gosh, I will never

346
00:18:03.435 --> 00:18:04.445
satisfy her.

347
00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:07.405
She'll never tell me she loves me. You know?

348
00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:10.005
So sometimes there's personality differences.

349
00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:13.165
Yeah. That factors in as well. For sure.

350
00:18:14.265 --> 00:18:18.925
So, um, that verse,

351
00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.565
Romans eight one, there's now

352
00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:22.765
therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ.

353
00:18:22.765 --> 00:18:26.245
Jesus is a, is a declaration of God's truth.

354
00:18:26.785 --> 00:18:29.765
It is true for every single believer.

355
00:18:30.665 --> 00:18:34.325
But on the other hand, that verse in Romans, it says,

356
00:18:35.015 --> 00:18:37.765
don't conform any longer to the patterns of this world,

357
00:18:37.865 --> 00:18:39.005
but be transformed.

358
00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:41.765
How? By the renewing of your mind,

359
00:18:42.665 --> 00:18:45.605
do you realize the renewing of your mind is not just

360
00:18:45.755 --> 00:18:49.405
what you think, it's healing of what you feel

361
00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:54.165
that's real important is that's all part of your mind.

362
00:18:54.755 --> 00:18:59.565
Okay? So what you think is very likely

363
00:19:01.575 --> 00:19:03.805
triggering either good emotion

364
00:19:03.945 --> 00:19:06.605
or bad emotion, depending upon what you're thinking.

365
00:19:07.505 --> 00:19:11.685
And so we'd say, well, if I am continuing

366
00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:14.405
to tell myself I'm stupid,

367
00:19:15.775 --> 00:19:19.885
which was part of my vocabulary for myself for years,

368
00:19:21.545 --> 00:19:26.085
I'm stupid, and I actually took that to heart

369
00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:29.685
so I would feel bad.

370
00:19:30.425 --> 00:19:32.285
Mm-Hmm. I'd feel condemned.

371
00:19:34.225 --> 00:19:36.165
And do you think that influenced my behavior?

372
00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:41.805
I you better believe it. And that was not coming from God.

373
00:19:43.345 --> 00:19:44.365
He would've been saying,

374
00:19:45.065 --> 00:19:47.325
you may not be the smartest cookie on the block,

375
00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:50.245
but you're not stupid.

376
00:19:51.705 --> 00:19:54.285
That's not what I, God would call you.

377
00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:59.805
I would start with, you're my beloved son, along

378
00:19:59.805 --> 00:20:03.245
with a bunch of others, but you are one of my beloved.

379
00:20:03.715 --> 00:20:06.925
Okay? So let's watch this video.

380
00:20:08.305 --> 00:20:10.885
And it's actually referring to the latter part

381
00:20:10.885 --> 00:20:13.285
of Romans eight, where

382
00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:17.645
the Apostle Paul wrote

383
00:20:18.225 --> 00:20:21.325
as if he was describing a legal courtroom.

384
00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:25.325
The terminology is almost like that of a courtroom.

385
00:20:27.345 --> 00:20:30.325
So I'm gonna let David be the one that does that for you.

386
00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:32.485
See if I can pull that up now.

387
00:20:35.545 --> 00:20:37.605
I'm sorry, I lost

388
00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:42.165
my there.

389
00:20:42.165 --> 00:20:43.165
It's,

390
00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:44.735
There we go.

391
00:20:49.675 --> 00:20:54.605
It's not gonna work. This is

392
00:20:54.605 --> 00:20:55.845
about three minutes long.

393
00:20:58.355 --> 00:21:00.325
There's a very mysterious, uh,

394
00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:02.205
passage in Romans chapter eight.

395
00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:06.005
It talks about there is no condemnation for those of us

396
00:21:06.145 --> 00:21:07.165
who are in Christ Jesus.

397
00:21:08.065 --> 00:21:11.205
So one of the challenges that we find in life today is how

398
00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:12.365
to experience more

399
00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:14.645
and more freedom from those self-doubts,

400
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:16.885
from those self condemning thoughts.

401
00:21:17.345 --> 00:21:21.085
And one of the ways to do that is to really, uh, deal with

402
00:21:21.545 --> 00:21:25.005
who is it that can bring charge or condemnation toward us?

403
00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:27.885
Too often in our day to day, we would say kind of anybody

404
00:21:27.905 --> 00:21:30.845
and everybody who could, uh, you know, criticize me,

405
00:21:30.855 --> 00:21:32.125
judge me, compared me.

406
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:33.845
Particularly in this world of social media

407
00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:36.885
and all the comparisons that are happening out there today.

408
00:21:37.115 --> 00:21:40.805
It's so easy to reinforce this condemnation, self blame

409
00:21:41.145 --> 00:21:44.565
as comparisons are made, you see that power

410
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.925
of bringing charge has been given to the one Jesus Christ.

411
00:21:47.985 --> 00:21:51.125
But the passage says, it's that one Jesus who's lived,

412
00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:52.405
whose died, has been raised

413
00:21:52.705 --> 00:21:55.365
and is now beautiful, present tense word, now

414
00:21:56.155 --> 00:21:57.165
interceding for you.

415
00:21:58.345 --> 00:22:00.085
Now that needs to bring a smile to your face,

416
00:22:00.115 --> 00:22:01.125
that only one person

417
00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:03.605
who can bring charge against you is praying for you.

418
00:22:04.225 --> 00:22:06.445
And so, in just a moment, we're gonna meditate on

419
00:22:06.445 --> 00:22:07.725
that kind of praying, Jesus.

420
00:22:08.305 --> 00:22:10.405
And the scene that we're gonna allow the Holy Spirit

421
00:22:10.425 --> 00:22:12.205
to paint inside of our hearts

422
00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.805
and minds is the scene of a courtroom.

423
00:22:14.185 --> 00:22:16.005
And so the imagery here is, of you

424
00:22:16.005 --> 00:22:18.245
and I walking alone into

425
00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:22.485
an unfriendly courtroom, would you bow with me?

426
00:22:22.485 --> 00:22:25.205
And let's do that. Heavenly Father, uh,

427
00:22:25.205 --> 00:22:27.605
we pray in these moments, there would be a fresh work

428
00:22:27.605 --> 00:22:30.685
of the Holy Spirit to bring freedom from condemnation.

429
00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:32.685
Would you imagine yourself walking

430
00:22:32.715 --> 00:22:33.965
into a courtroom all alone?

431
00:22:34.185 --> 00:22:36.405
You notice unfriendly faces are there,

432
00:22:36.535 --> 00:22:38.445
there are people there who in the past have

433
00:22:38.445 --> 00:22:39.685
judged or criticized you.

434
00:22:40.105 --> 00:22:41.285
And now your uncertainty

435
00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:43.965
and anxiety is even further increased.

436
00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:47.485
But who is it really that can bring charge against you?

437
00:22:47.855 --> 00:22:49.685
Would you imagine? Right now into

438
00:22:49.685 --> 00:22:53.125
that courtroom walks Jesus Christ, he walks right into

439
00:22:53.125 --> 00:22:55.365
that courtroom, puts his arm gently around you.

440
00:22:55.945 --> 00:22:58.285
He begins to pray for you, begins to pray for the needs

441
00:22:58.285 --> 00:22:59.805
of your life, the burdens of your heart.

442
00:23:00.835 --> 00:23:02.365
He's praying your prayer list.

443
00:23:02.935 --> 00:23:05.725
Allow the Holy Spirit to touch you with the wonder

444
00:23:05.825 --> 00:23:09.045
of a praying Jesus who is so attentive, so knowing of you

445
00:23:09.515 --> 00:23:11.405
that he is praying specifically

446
00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:12.885
for the burdens and needs of your life.

447
00:23:13.505 --> 00:23:14.925
And as you hear him pray,

448
00:23:15.085 --> 00:23:17.525
would you imagine he whispers these words to you?

449
00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:20.365
Where are your accusers?

450
00:23:21.745 --> 00:23:23.285
And you open your eyes to look around

451
00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:25.125
and all those unfriendly faces are gone.

452
00:23:25.545 --> 00:23:27.165
And Jesus continues to pray.

453
00:23:28.425 --> 00:23:32.405
And he prays these words, neither do I accuse you.

454
00:23:33.295 --> 00:23:35.805
Would you allow the Holy Spirit to use that truth

455
00:23:36.345 --> 00:23:40.365
to cast out any, any seeds of condemnation, any threads

456
00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:41.725
of condemnation in your heart?

457
00:23:41.825 --> 00:23:43.765
Any self-blame self-criticism?

458
00:23:45.235 --> 00:23:47.645
Neither do I accuse you.

459
00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:51.445
Take some time now to continue your Jesus story.

460
00:23:52.135 --> 00:23:53.485
First, listen to his voice

461
00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:57.045
and hear what he wants to say just for you.

462
00:23:57.945 --> 00:23:59.285
And after you've heard from him,

463
00:23:59.595 --> 00:24:01.245
respond back to him in a personal way.

464
00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:04.125
Tell Jesus what's on your heart.

465
00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:41.195
Allow the Holy Spirit to take this truth

466
00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:45.075
of a praying Jesus deeply into your heart, that

467
00:24:45.305 --> 00:24:48.595
that freedom might bring forth joy and wonder

468
00:24:48.935 --> 00:24:52.075
and gratitude that it might lead to more

469
00:24:52.075 --> 00:24:53.875
and more life abundant.

470
00:24:53.935 --> 00:24:57.915
Do that we ask Jesus even now. Amen. Amen.

471
00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:12.115
Experience more and more freedom from those self doubts,

472
00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:14.275
from those self condemning thoughts.

473
00:25:15.265 --> 00:25:19.795
Okay? So in just a minute, I'm going to let you share

474
00:25:19.795 --> 00:25:23.355
with your spouse maybe what came to your thoughts

475
00:25:24.015 --> 00:25:26.675
as you were listening to the meditation

476
00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:28.235
or even hearing from the Lord.

477
00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:32.515
Um, and remember that some

478
00:25:32.515 --> 00:25:35.915
of you might have experienced something very good during

479
00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:39.275
that time and that would be caused to

480
00:25:40.235 --> 00:25:41.595
rejoice with him.

481
00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:46.395
And some of you may have simply been reminded of some

482
00:25:46.395 --> 00:25:48.555
of the hurt that you had experienced,

483
00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:51.075
and that would call for compassion.

484
00:25:51.955 --> 00:25:56.875
I care that you might still be dealing with some of

485
00:25:56.875 --> 00:26:01.715
that and want you to know that I would not want to be

486
00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:05.815
adding any condemnation to you.

487
00:26:07.335 --> 00:26:09.915
So I want to, uh, give you a,

488
00:26:12.145 --> 00:26:14.595
some verses that I have found very helpful.

489
00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:20.035
Uh, I think there's enough of, for one, for everybody on

490
00:26:20.035 --> 00:26:20.955
This one. So

491
00:26:21.395 --> 00:26:23.115
I encourage you to go ahead and take one.

492
00:26:23.945 --> 00:26:26.035
I've got some verses some things on the back,

493
00:26:26.095 --> 00:26:28.515
but I'm not going to be using that now.

494
00:26:29.975 --> 00:26:33.635
But, um, four verses that

495
00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:37.395
will just give you some additional

496
00:26:37.485 --> 00:26:40.835
truth to reflect on.

497
00:26:47.745 --> 00:26:50.405
You know, it's one thing to try to stop

498
00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:53.965
tapes from playing in my head

499
00:26:54.225 --> 00:26:58.045
or my own voice, uh, judging me

500
00:26:58.145 --> 00:27:02.045
and critical harsh ways, um,

501
00:27:02.435 --> 00:27:05.365
keeping in mind that some of the most common ways

502
00:27:05.515 --> 00:27:08.205
that a sense of I'm not enough

503
00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:11.885
or, uh, I'm unlovable

504
00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:14.925
or anything in that direction.

505
00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:17.685
I'm stupid, I'm foolish, I'm a mess up.

506
00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:20.445
All of those kinds of things.

507
00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:23.525
Many times they have come from

508
00:27:25.275 --> 00:27:27.205
extreme criticism in childhood.

509
00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:30.045
That's where the seeds got planted.

510
00:27:30.135 --> 00:27:32.085
We're not trying to blame everything on parents.

511
00:27:32.795 --> 00:27:34.125
That could have come from bullies.

512
00:27:34.125 --> 00:27:36.485
That could have come from people rejecting you

513
00:27:36.485 --> 00:27:38.565
because you look different than they did,

514
00:27:38.665 --> 00:27:40.925
or you were a nerd and they weren't.

515
00:27:41.305 --> 00:27:42.805
Uh, all kinds of things.

516
00:27:43.785 --> 00:27:45.885
But it often comes from extreme criticism.

517
00:27:45.945 --> 00:27:47.925
It also can come from extreme neglect,

518
00:27:48.975 --> 00:27:50.965
which is a little harder to spot sometimes.

519
00:27:51.145 --> 00:27:53.125
But if you have legitimate God ordained needs

520
00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:56.325
and they're not being provided for a need for security,

521
00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:58.885
for example, if that's not being

522
00:27:59.165 --> 00:28:03.165
provided, that's a form of something good that God wants you

523
00:28:03.165 --> 00:28:05.525
to have, but it was not being provided.

524
00:28:05.785 --> 00:28:07.685
And it's essentially neglect.

525
00:28:08.275 --> 00:28:09.925
It's a need that's going unmet.

526
00:28:11.185 --> 00:28:14.485
Um, so there's a lot of things.

527
00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:19.125
Obviously abuse of any kind can contribute to a sense

528
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:21.485
of worthlessness or a sense of being unworthy,

529
00:28:22.305 --> 00:28:24.165
uh, not valued.

530
00:28:25.305 --> 00:28:26.565
Um, so,

531
00:28:26.825 --> 00:28:30.885
and keep in mind, um, that

532
00:28:33.145 --> 00:28:34.965
is not something God is calling you.

533
00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:39.725
Do any of us deserve Jesus down on the cross?

534
00:28:39.725 --> 00:28:42.485
First I'd say, no, we don't, we didn't do anything

535
00:28:42.505 --> 00:28:44.965
or couldn't do anything to deserve that.

536
00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:49.645
But God is not the one saying, you're not worth loving

537
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:51.005
because he loved us first.

538
00:28:51.345 --> 00:28:52.685
That's proof. Okay?

539
00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:55.765
So these are the verses we love because he first loved us.

540
00:28:56.745 --> 00:29:01.205
Um, he didn't wait for you to perform before he loved you.

541
00:29:02.245 --> 00:29:05.965
'cause Romans five, eight says that he actually,

542
00:29:05.975 --> 00:29:10.125
while we were still sinners, was choosing to send his son

543
00:29:10.125 --> 00:29:11.485
to a cross to die for us.

544
00:29:12.055 --> 00:29:15.325
There is your proof that you weren't, you weren't,

545
00:29:15.325 --> 00:29:17.285
he wasn't waiting for you to perform.

546
00:29:17.835 --> 00:29:20.885
Okay. My favorite verse, one

547
00:29:20.885 --> 00:29:23.045
of my favorite verses is Zephaniah three 17,

548
00:29:23.145 --> 00:29:24.805
the Lord your God is with you.

549
00:29:25.745 --> 00:29:27.725
The mighty warrior who saves,

550
00:29:28.905 --> 00:29:31.405
he will take great, what's that word?

551
00:29:32.275 --> 00:29:34.485
Delight in

552
00:29:34.485 --> 00:29:37.735
you, in his love.

553
00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:39.695
He will no longer rebuke you,

554
00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:45.755
but he will rejoice over you with singing one

555
00:29:45.855 --> 00:29:47.035
of the translations.

556
00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:48.675
Not this particular one.

557
00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:52.245
You, uh, phrases one of those sentences

558
00:29:52.345 --> 00:29:54.645
as he will calm you with his love.

559
00:29:56.885 --> 00:29:59.725
I love that. It's kind like when I'm all, I'm all

560
00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:03.765
stressed out, he's saying, I got this.

561
00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:06.365
Here's another one that says, if he will quiet

562
00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:08.325
You with, quiet you with his love, thank you. Which

563
00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:09.845
Means like, I can just imagine you,

564
00:30:09.905 --> 00:30:12.325
you're projecting all this condemnation on yourself, right?

565
00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:14.285
Yeah. Talking to yourself instead of preaching to yourself.

566
00:30:14.385 --> 00:30:18.005
Yes. And now, and then he quiet s**t. Yeah. With his love.

567
00:30:18.185 --> 00:30:20.005
You know, that's just so overwhelmed

568
00:30:20.005 --> 00:30:21.965
and overpowers all that condemnation, right?

569
00:30:21.995 --> 00:30:26.125
Yeah. With the, the words Romans eight, one. Yeah.

570
00:30:26.145 --> 00:30:27.205
For instance, or something else

571
00:30:27.235 --> 00:30:29.525
that when you start preaching to yourself Yeah.

572
00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:30.525
Instead of listening

573
00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:31.525
To yourself. I love that.

574
00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:34.285
Yeah. I had not ever heard that particular

575
00:30:34.915 --> 00:30:37.645
application, but I I totally agree with it.

576
00:30:38.235 --> 00:30:40.605
Yeah. His love. And it's with his love.

577
00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:44.245
He's just saying, I got this. We're good.

578
00:30:44.775 --> 00:30:48.365
We're gonna make it. Okay. Sure.

579
00:30:48.365 --> 00:30:49.525
To goodness and mercy

580
00:30:50.145 --> 00:30:52.805
or love will follow me all the days of my life.

581
00:30:52.825 --> 00:30:54.285
And I will go on the house of the Lord.

582
00:30:55.195 --> 00:30:58.005
It's that, I think I might have mentioned this the previous

583
00:30:58.005 --> 00:30:59.925
week, but he's following you.

584
00:31:00.195 --> 00:31:01.445
He's not waiting for you.

585
00:31:02.785 --> 00:31:07.165
And then, uh, the passage in John nine

586
00:31:08.715 --> 00:31:09.845
that says he went

587
00:31:09.855 --> 00:31:12.245
after the one who had been kicked out of the church.

588
00:31:12.425 --> 00:31:13.725
We talked about that last time.

589
00:31:13.845 --> 00:31:18.215
I think, uh, one other thing about David's meditation,

590
00:31:18.275 --> 00:31:20.015
you might have noticed that he

591
00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:21.575
actually included a reference.

592
00:31:21.575 --> 00:31:25.055
He didn't name it, but he actually referred back to someone

593
00:31:25.595 --> 00:31:29.135
who was being condemned by the religious leaders.

594
00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:31.335
The woman caught in adultery.

595
00:31:32.095 --> 00:31:36.095
I think that's John a And that's

596
00:31:36.095 --> 00:31:39.485
where he literally said to her, uh,

597
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:44.325
after he had gotten rid of them by saying, okay, if you,

598
00:31:44.505 --> 00:31:45.605
if you haven't ever sinned,

599
00:31:45.605 --> 00:31:46.965
then you can start throwing your stone.

600
00:31:46.965 --> 00:31:49.125
And they all left. Then he turns to her

601
00:31:49.125 --> 00:31:51.485
and says, where are your accusers?

602
00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:53.845
One translation actually says Condemners.

603
00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:57.485
And she says, they've gone.

604
00:31:57.485 --> 00:32:02.045
He says, neither do I condemn you. Go and say no more.

605
00:32:03.465 --> 00:32:06.805
So take a moment thinking about those verses

606
00:32:07.825 --> 00:32:12.085
as there is what your god's

607
00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:17.445
attitude towards you is based on his own words.

608
00:32:20.145 --> 00:32:24.445
But just share any thoughts that you have about your own

609
00:32:25.015 --> 00:32:26.965
sense of struggle.

610
00:32:27.185 --> 00:32:30.565
Or if you don't struggle with that, rejoice in that. Okay.

611
00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:34.445
All right. And I know there's a couple

612
00:32:34.445 --> 00:32:37.925
of you here without your spouses, if you guys want to just

613
00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:40.965
pop over and share with each other a little bit,

614
00:32:41.115 --> 00:32:42.965
that would be courageous. But,

615
00:32:43.065 --> 00:32:46.045
Uh, Anyway, I leave that to you.

616
00:32:46.315 --> 00:32:47.765
Okay. Go ahead and share.

617
00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.165
We'll take about five minutes for this.

618
00:40:36.165 --> 00:40:37.255
It's doing my civic duty.

619
00:41:23.055 --> 00:41:25.255
I can, I can't figure out how to shut off the music.

620
00:41:26.255 --> 00:41:29.495
I thought if I just checked out of that, it would do

621
00:41:29.495 --> 00:41:30.495
That.

622
00:41:49.025 --> 00:41:51.285
So notice when I couldn't figure out how

623
00:41:51.625 --> 00:41:55.205
to turn off the music, I didn't tell myself I'm stupid.

624
00:41:57.595 --> 00:42:01.845
Instead I said, God has already pursued you

625
00:42:02.235 --> 00:42:05.565
with resources, some of whom are right here.

626
00:42:06.785 --> 00:42:08.885
He will quite you. And the music with

627
00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:11.875
That is so good.

628
00:42:12.395 --> 00:42:16.185
Alright. So hope

629
00:42:16.185 --> 00:42:17.545
that went well for you.

630
00:42:17.545 --> 00:42:20.985
Just having another, uh, time of

631
00:42:21.815 --> 00:42:25.105
meeting each other at the point of our deeper thoughts

632
00:42:25.205 --> 00:42:27.305
and feelings and considerations

633
00:42:28.095 --> 00:42:32.785
that we might have corrective emotional experiences for

634
00:42:32.815 --> 00:42:35.865
what the world that we live in has produced.

635
00:42:36.655 --> 00:42:40.945
Okay. And we can't count on that from our culture

636
00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:45.745
or, uh, even always our, even our neighbors.

637
00:42:45.925 --> 00:42:49.185
But we want to be able to count on that from each other

638
00:42:49.485 --> 00:42:53.065
and to know how to restore times when we have missed,

639
00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:54.185
missed that mark.

640
00:42:55.605 --> 00:42:59.025
So I put up here on the board, um,

641
00:43:00.295 --> 00:43:04.385
just a context for what are we doing in this course.

642
00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:07.345
Really a lot of this has to do

643
00:43:07.345 --> 00:43:09.505
with taking us from a rational

644
00:43:09.685 --> 00:43:14.105
and behavioral, uh, way of approaching us each other

645
00:43:14.135 --> 00:43:18.185
with expectations to one that's truly more relational,

646
00:43:19.235 --> 00:43:21.665
where I'm really hearing you and seeing you

647
00:43:23.645 --> 00:43:25.025
and not judging you.

648
00:43:26.925 --> 00:43:31.705
Um, but where the focus really goes to needs

649
00:43:31.855 --> 00:43:35.985
that you have, that I more than anybody else on planet Earth

650
00:43:36.645 --> 00:43:40.305
am called to serve those legitimate God ordained needs.

651
00:43:41.415 --> 00:43:43.705
Okay? And that's a very different approach.

652
00:43:43.815 --> 00:43:45.665
It's almost like saying, okay, Jesus,

653
00:43:45.765 --> 00:43:47.065
how are we gonna love Joyce today?

654
00:43:47.285 --> 00:43:48.705
And I think I blew it yesterday.

655
00:43:49.325 --> 00:43:52.225
So what do I need to do about that? Does that make sense?

656
00:43:52.365 --> 00:43:56.825
Mm-Hmm. And he's not beating me

657
00:43:56.825 --> 00:43:57.865
up over the mistakes.

658
00:43:57.895 --> 00:44:01.225
He's saying, let's do that again. Let's do that over.

659
00:44:01.895 --> 00:44:05.065
Does that make sense? It really makes a pretty good

660
00:44:05.065 --> 00:44:06.385
parenting model, by the way.

661
00:44:06.405 --> 00:44:10.745
Mm-Hmm. Um, so, um,

662
00:44:13.175 --> 00:44:15.385
want to transition to, um,

663
00:44:17.325 --> 00:44:18.505
one other aspect of this.

664
00:44:18.645 --> 00:44:21.025
I'm just checking myself to see if I'm,

665
00:44:22.125 --> 00:44:24.345
if I've covered everything that I want to cover on that.

666
00:44:24.905 --> 00:44:29.585
I think so. Ah, so what do you do

667
00:44:29.685 --> 00:44:30.825
to try to repair

668
00:44:34.955 --> 00:44:39.215
wounds that might have actually contributed

669
00:44:39.435 --> 00:44:43.255
to some feelings about

670
00:44:44.085 --> 00:44:46.535
oneself like Joyce was sharing

671
00:44:47.405 --> 00:44:51.695
that her criticism was kind of tapping into a vulnerability

672
00:44:51.725 --> 00:44:55.335
that I already had and kind of adding to that.

673
00:44:56.475 --> 00:44:59.935
So clearly what you just heard her reference when she

674
00:44:59.935 --> 00:45:02.775
basically said, I repented of that.

675
00:45:03.595 --> 00:45:05.255
She didn't use that word today, but she did.

676
00:45:06.875 --> 00:45:09.215
And the word repent means to turn around

677
00:45:10.115 --> 00:45:11.415
and go the opposite direction.

678
00:45:11.715 --> 00:45:16.295
So it, it implies not just a words that I say, it's a change

679
00:45:16.965 --> 00:45:18.975
working from the inside out in me.

680
00:45:20.655 --> 00:45:23.775
I am moved with godly sorrow for how

681
00:45:23.925 --> 00:45:25.695
that has been hurtful to you.

682
00:45:25.925 --> 00:45:27.935
That was part of the material

683
00:45:27.935 --> 00:45:29.695
that you read in the last week or so.

684
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:35.885
And based on that movement in my heart called Godly sorrow,

685
00:45:37.065 --> 00:45:40.845
that's what's motivating the needed change in my behavior.

686
00:45:42.145 --> 00:45:45.965
If I get to godly sorrow, which is not

687
00:45:46.565 --> 00:45:48.805
condemnation, see the difference?

688
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:52.805
Godly sorrow is tied to something I did or failed to do.

689
00:45:53.945 --> 00:45:58.565
And it's very much related to some behavior of mine.

690
00:45:58.565 --> 00:46:01.325
Either something I did or something I didn't do.

691
00:46:02.665 --> 00:46:05.765
And I should feel conviction over

692
00:46:07.035 --> 00:46:08.205
that if it was wrong.

693
00:46:09.465 --> 00:46:11.325
But conviction is not condemnation.

694
00:46:12.095 --> 00:46:16.325
Conviction says that isn't living according to my way.

695
00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:20.965
Let's repent of that and get this right moving forward.

696
00:46:21.425 --> 00:46:24.165
And by the way, you need to go care for your spouse

697
00:46:24.165 --> 00:46:26.045
because they've already been hurt by that.

698
00:46:26.765 --> 00:46:30.025
So that's part of the what to do with condemnation.

699
00:46:30.615 --> 00:46:34.065
It's not just about condemnation's not tied

700
00:46:34.165 --> 00:46:35.305
so much to what you do.

701
00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.905
It is tied to who you think you are.

702
00:46:38.805 --> 00:46:40.705
See, it's not about behavior, it's about identity

703
00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:42.745
or sense of identity.

704
00:46:44.045 --> 00:46:47.585
That's why I can be a born again

705
00:46:48.245 --> 00:46:51.705
Christ follower, imperfect as I am,

706
00:46:51.805 --> 00:46:55.145
but still Christ has come to abide in me.

707
00:46:56.445 --> 00:46:58.545
His sacrifice on the cross applies to me.

708
00:47:01.325 --> 00:47:05.225
And yet I can still think

709
00:47:07.805 --> 00:47:09.105
things about myself

710
00:47:09.105 --> 00:47:10.945
that are very different from what he says.

711
00:47:11.125 --> 00:47:15.825
So one of the ways that we can work with that is to

712
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:21.065
embrace the truth of his way of loving me,

713
00:47:21.415 --> 00:47:22.825
this unconditional love.

714
00:47:23.925 --> 00:47:27.585
The other though, is to experience more of what's good

715
00:47:29.065 --> 00:47:31.485
to experience about who you are.

716
00:47:32.545 --> 00:47:34.125
See, I said it's tied to identity.

717
00:47:34.225 --> 00:47:37.605
If it's condemnation, a sense of I'm not enough.

718
00:47:38.715 --> 00:47:42.845
Well, who knows you best of all on planet earth,

719
00:47:44.175 --> 00:47:46.445
apart from God, who's that gonna be?

720
00:47:47.185 --> 00:47:49.485
Me? Spouse. Yeah. Yeah.

721
00:47:49.695 --> 00:47:52.165
Joyce is gonna know me, warts and all.

722
00:47:53.145 --> 00:47:56.005
Um, your spouse probably knows you better than anybody.

723
00:47:56.835 --> 00:48:00.565
Okay? And what if

724
00:48:01.155 --> 00:48:05.725
they are regularly speaking

725
00:48:06.375 --> 00:48:11.365
truth to you about what God sees in you?

726
00:48:11.425 --> 00:48:14.075
That's good affirmation.

727
00:48:15.975 --> 00:48:18.315
Not just about something you did once.

728
00:48:19.575 --> 00:48:22.755
Congratulations, you graduated from this place

729
00:48:22.815 --> 00:48:24.075
or this place or whatever.

730
00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:28.515
That's all good. But where they look in your heart

731
00:48:28.535 --> 00:48:31.995
and say, I see great stability in you.

732
00:48:32.895 --> 00:48:36.715
Or I think you've got

733
00:48:37.395 --> 00:48:42.075
determination that a lot of people don't have, whatever

734
00:48:42.075 --> 00:48:44.315
that trait is, sensitivity,

735
00:48:47.115 --> 00:48:49.455
Um, Loyalty,

736
00:48:51.255 --> 00:48:52.335
whatever that is.

737
00:48:53.675 --> 00:48:55.495
So I want to give you just another minute

738
00:48:55.555 --> 00:48:58.455
or two to give thought to

739
00:49:00.045 --> 00:49:02.215
what is it Maybe a couple of things

740
00:49:02.215 --> 00:49:04.775
that I could say this is true of you.

741
00:49:04.795 --> 00:49:07.495
And I may have said it before, but I'm saying it again.

742
00:49:08.695 --> 00:49:09.775
I see this in you.

743
00:49:10.885 --> 00:49:14.975
Okay? And I hope that you do that

744
00:49:14.975 --> 00:49:16.335
for your kids also.

745
00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:20.755
Mm-Hmm. 'cause they'll probably give you opportunity to have

746
00:49:20.755 --> 00:49:22.275
to deal with some correction.

747
00:49:23.105 --> 00:49:25.275
This would be an affirmation. Okay?

748
00:49:28.555 --> 00:49:30.375
So just ask the Lord to bring

749
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:31.855
to your mind a couple of things.

750
00:49:34.195 --> 00:49:38.455
Uh, I would often illustrate,

751
00:49:40.955 --> 00:49:43.855
uh, something like this exercise, uh,

752
00:49:44.075 --> 00:49:46.375
by pointing out things about Joyce

753
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:50.295
that were about her diligence and her determination

754
00:49:50.635 --> 00:49:55.095
and, um, her responsibility.

755
00:49:55.235 --> 00:49:56.815
And those were always true.

756
00:50:00.365 --> 00:50:03.865
But what's fun is kind of watching for, what do I see now

757
00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.825
that might be even different than that?

758
00:50:08.495 --> 00:50:13.065
This girl can't learn about

759
00:50:13.545 --> 00:50:16.865
somebody who's in need without sending them a card.

760
00:50:19.205 --> 00:50:21.825
Can I tell on you who you're sending one to?

761
00:50:22.945 --> 00:50:25.225
I guess, who am I sending one to? I dunno.

762
00:50:26.605 --> 00:50:28.365
Kenzie. Oh

763
00:50:28.395 --> 00:50:29.395
Yeah. Okay.

764
00:50:29.395 --> 00:50:31.565
Um,

765
00:50:33.685 --> 00:50:35.205
I mentioned we watched sports.

766
00:50:35.315 --> 00:50:38.285
Well, we watched OU softball, uh,

767
00:50:38.715 --> 00:50:39.885
some games they were playing.

768
00:50:39.945 --> 00:50:41.405
And there's this one player

769
00:50:41.425 --> 00:50:44.205
that's been there quite a time, uh, happens.

770
00:50:44.505 --> 00:50:45.845
We know she's a believer.

771
00:50:47.705 --> 00:50:52.445
And, uh, so George just said

772
00:50:52.445 --> 00:50:55.845
after watch game, I'm gonna send Kenzie a card.

773
00:50:56.985 --> 00:50:59.725
And next thing I know, she's asking for a stamp.

774
00:51:00.245 --> 00:51:02.965
I mean, she just gets it done.

775
00:51:03.905 --> 00:51:05.645
I'd think about it for about three weeks.

776
00:51:07.785 --> 00:51:11.205
And I'm just saying that's not only diligence, that's

777
00:51:12.515 --> 00:51:15.965
empathy and kindness and friendliness.

778
00:51:17.225 --> 00:51:21.285
And she's not expecting that girl who's kind of a celebrity.

779
00:51:21.375 --> 00:51:24.365
She's not expecting her to do anything for Joyce.

780
00:51:24.745 --> 00:51:27.245
So I'm just saying that's a character trait.

781
00:51:29.145 --> 00:51:32.685
She sees something that would be a way to touch somebody.

782
00:51:32.905 --> 00:51:37.795
And she acts on not so much this guy. Mm-Hmm.

783
00:51:37.795 --> 00:51:39.715
Little different guy. Mm-Hmm. Okay.

784
00:51:39.935 --> 00:51:41.675
So that was an affirmation hurt.

785
00:51:41.935 --> 00:51:43.395
So just take a couple minutes here.

786
00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:46.555
I think I've bought you enough time, uh, to think something.

787
00:51:47.065 --> 00:51:48.395
Okay. And for,

788
00:51:48.395 --> 00:51:52.715
and for you guys to, uh, your spouses aren't here today.

789
00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:54.435
Maybe just make a note or two

790
00:51:54.495 --> 00:51:55.835
or something you could share later.

791
00:51:56.105 --> 00:51:57.875
Okay. Alright. Go ahead.

792
00:55:25.825 --> 00:55:28.285
Can I borrow your help again?

793
00:55:28.475 --> 00:55:30.685
Stop the music. I

794
00:55:30.685 --> 00:55:32.805
Didn't see how you pump that up. There's

795
00:55:32.805 --> 00:55:33.845
A little play button up here

796
00:55:34.225 --> 00:55:36.485
and this tiny little spot. It's hard to see.

797
00:55:37.225 --> 00:55:38.565
Oh, okay. When you click that

798
00:55:39.215 --> 00:55:40.215
Pause here.

799
00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:42.365
Okay. Thank you.

800
00:55:44.365 --> 00:55:45.805
I think we can just close your hands.

801
00:55:49.835 --> 00:55:50.835
Okay.

802
00:55:56.115 --> 00:56:01.005
Yesterday. That's okay. It's just a clip.

803
00:56:07.625 --> 00:56:10.565
So the last time we taught this class, thank you.

804
00:56:11.665 --> 00:56:14.645
The last time we taught this class, um,

805
00:56:15.065 --> 00:56:18.285
we were running short of time that particular week.

806
00:56:18.985 --> 00:56:22.765
And so I kind of glossed over the part on sexual intimacy

807
00:56:23.425 --> 00:56:25.085
and I got scolded afterwards,

808
00:56:26.195 --> 00:56:28.285
Condemned, Not quiet,

809
00:56:29.675 --> 00:56:31.205
Scolded Held accountable

810
00:56:33.115 --> 00:56:34.405
Holy Spirit type stuff.

811
00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:39.685
And, and it, and it was basically, uh, a guy in the class

812
00:56:40.105 --> 00:56:44.405
who, um, had heard

813
00:56:45.385 --> 00:56:49.685
enough people either totally dismissed talking about sexual

814
00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:51.525
intimacy in the church,

815
00:56:52.545 --> 00:56:54.405
or, um,

816
00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:59.605
they came from an old traditional way of looking at things

817
00:56:59.995 --> 00:57:04.245
that didn't really bless sexual intimacy as part

818
00:57:04.245 --> 00:57:08.205
of God's desire, that we would experience

819
00:57:08.835 --> 00:57:12.485
closeness in a way that was truly mutually

820
00:57:13.135 --> 00:57:14.725
validating and satisfying.

821
00:57:15.785 --> 00:57:18.325
And so that's clearly his will for us.

822
00:57:19.545 --> 00:57:24.005
Um, and so I decided I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

823
00:57:24.165 --> 00:57:25.965
I don't want anybody holding me accountable like that,

824
00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:30.405
but seriously, um, I'm, I'm going to,

825
00:57:30.865 --> 00:57:32.805
uh, just cover a few things about it.

826
00:57:32.945 --> 00:57:36.285
One of the things that helped me the most in terms of this

827
00:57:37.025 --> 00:57:40.245
is I was clearly raised in, uh,

828
00:57:40.805 --> 00:57:44.165
a much easier environment than what kids have today.

829
00:57:44.605 --> 00:57:48.525
I mean, I just can't imagine being a parent of a child today

830
00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:52.525
and trying to help them navigate all the things

831
00:57:52.555 --> 00:57:57.245
that are pressed upon them through media, through, uh,

832
00:57:58.255 --> 00:57:59.525
peers, et cetera.

833
00:58:00.385 --> 00:58:02.045
But we had our own share of

834
00:58:02.945 --> 00:58:05.645
not good things going on back when we were growing up.

835
00:58:06.625 --> 00:58:10.685
But, um, I just remember there being a lot

836
00:58:10.685 --> 00:58:12.685
of focus on, uh,

837
00:58:15.745 --> 00:58:18.725
sex being something that we take

838
00:58:20.345 --> 00:58:25.085
or we have, which makes it like a possession.

839
00:58:26.515 --> 00:58:28.565
Does that make sense? In a general sense?

840
00:58:28.595 --> 00:58:32.365
It's like if we view it as something we have

841
00:58:33.065 --> 00:58:37.365
or do, uh, rather than something

842
00:58:37.395 --> 00:58:39.165
that is part of how we grow

843
00:58:39.225 --> 00:58:44.165
and share, then we're, we're, we're probably

844
00:58:44.765 --> 00:58:47.365
actually building in a little bit of performance pressure

845
00:58:48.065 --> 00:58:49.445
on one or both of us.

846
00:58:50.945 --> 00:58:52.205
And that'll get in the way.

847
00:58:52.705 --> 00:58:55.245
So we don't want it to be something we take

848
00:58:55.425 --> 00:58:58.165
or something we have, uh,

849
00:58:58.175 --> 00:59:01.845
definitely not something we keep score on, okay?

850
00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:04.645
'cause that puts a performance issue into it.

851
00:59:05.145 --> 00:59:07.965
But it's rather, it's something that we are becoming,

852
00:59:08.255 --> 00:59:12.805
we're becoming more free to express our intimacy

853
00:59:12.805 --> 00:59:14.005
and our love for one another,

854
00:59:14.995 --> 00:59:17.485
including in physical closeness.

855
00:59:18.355 --> 00:59:22.485
Okay? So just kind of a bit of a mindset there.

856
00:59:23.145 --> 00:59:27.045
God intended our sexual intimacy to honor him,

857
00:59:27.825 --> 00:59:32.245
but also to be mutually fulfilling to both spouses.

858
00:59:33.665 --> 00:59:35.125
Now that among other things,

859
00:59:35.135 --> 00:59:37.445
we've already talked about differences in personality

860
00:59:37.705 --> 00:59:42.685
and how, if I'm gonna meet Joyce's relational

861
00:59:42.735 --> 00:59:44.765
needs, not talking sexual needs right now,

862
00:59:44.825 --> 00:59:48.605
but relational needs, if I'm gonna meet those needs, I need

863
00:59:48.605 --> 00:59:52.165
to meet them according to what really is relevant

864
00:59:52.165 --> 00:59:54.845
to her rather than the way I would want that need met.

865
00:59:55.075 --> 00:59:59.485
Okay? But when it comes to sex, we never want to

866
01:00:00.425 --> 01:00:03.685
expect someone to participate in something

867
01:00:03.685 --> 01:00:05.805
that isn't comfortable for them.

868
01:00:06.985 --> 01:00:11.165
So that's kind of a ground rule, is there might be something

869
01:00:11.165 --> 01:00:13.605
that you would experience as pleasurable,

870
01:00:14.265 --> 01:00:17.285
but it would actually create stress

871
01:00:17.585 --> 01:00:20.085
or, uh, anxiety for your spouse.

872
01:00:20.305 --> 01:00:23.725
And we'd say, don't do it, then take that off the table.

873
01:00:24.595 --> 01:00:26.445
Okay? It ain't worth it

874
01:00:26.585 --> 01:00:30.285
to make somebody feel uncomfortable in order to

875
01:00:31.375 --> 01:00:33.125
experience pleasure in a certain way.

876
01:00:34.425 --> 01:00:38.605
So that's kind of boldly me speaking something that, um,

877
01:00:39.505 --> 01:00:41.685
was very important for us to understand too.

878
01:00:43.115 --> 01:00:45.575
But on the other hand, um,

879
01:00:47.325 --> 01:00:51.545
within the scope of what are both of you

880
01:00:52.975 --> 01:00:57.785
okay with, um, learn from each other?

881
01:00:57.855 --> 01:01:01.265
Well, what, what would make an ideal,

882
01:01:02.645 --> 01:01:06.865
uh, sexual encounter with me?

883
01:01:07.135 --> 01:01:09.345
What would make that better for you?

884
01:01:09.615 --> 01:01:13.025
What would make that enjoyable and pleasurable for you

885
01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:16.745
and honoring to you as well as to God?

886
01:01:17.495 --> 01:01:20.905
Okay? So in a minute I'm gonna pass out some worksheets,

887
01:01:20.905 --> 01:01:21.985
but this is homework.

888
01:01:24.665 --> 01:01:26.065
I think I timed this about right,

889
01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:31.385
so I'm not skirting the issue, but, um, I was

890
01:01:31.545 --> 01:01:33.065
Getting ready to volunteer the Brooks if

891
01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:34.105
you needed somebody to.

892
01:01:38.205 --> 01:01:40.105
No, that could get a lot of us some trouble.

893
01:01:40.265 --> 01:01:45.145
Dangerous, okay? So they, they actually developed a, a way,

894
01:01:45.525 --> 01:01:47.025
uh, kind of a questionnaire for you

895
01:01:47.025 --> 01:01:48.705
to individually reflect on

896
01:01:48.925 --> 01:01:53.665
and then actually express your own preferences about

897
01:01:53.775 --> 01:01:58.625
what would make this, um, experience pleasurable.

898
01:01:59.545 --> 01:02:00.905
I remember David Ferguson,

899
01:02:00.915 --> 01:02:02.905
who's got a real good sense of humor.

900
01:02:03.725 --> 01:02:06.785
Uh, do you remember this, uh, saying that

901
01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:11.225
when his wife came back with her list,

902
01:02:12.485 --> 01:02:15.305
it started with two weeks beforehand,

903
01:02:20.735 --> 01:02:23.765
flirt with me two weeks before,

904
01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:28.165
and then I, I may mess this up, up calendaring,

905
01:02:28.165 --> 01:02:29.165
These items, right?

906
01:02:29.235 --> 01:02:31.365
Yeah. And then she had, you know,

907
01:02:31.425 --> 01:02:36.285
and then, uh, let's have some time on the patio talking.

908
01:02:37.745 --> 01:02:40.405
And basically she was coming up with a lot

909
01:02:40.665 --> 01:02:42.565
of relational things

910
01:02:45.635 --> 01:02:49.445
long before we get close to the bedroom, okay?

911
01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:50.845
Like maybe days before,

912
01:02:51.755 --> 01:02:56.285
Because That's actually helping her feel loved

913
01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:58.965
and cared for and respected and so forth.

914
01:03:00.865 --> 01:03:03.725
And David said, I looked at my sheet for my preferences

915
01:03:06.865 --> 01:03:09.365
and he said, number one, get naked.

916
01:03:14.025 --> 01:03:18.805
And, uh, so

917
01:03:18.945 --> 01:03:21.485
by in large part,

918
01:03:22.945 --> 01:03:24.325
God wired us differently

919
01:03:26.625 --> 01:03:29.485
and this is one of the places where that really matters.

920
01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:33.765
So, um, just taking

921
01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:38.405
that into consideration, you each fill this out,

922
01:03:38.935 --> 01:03:41.845
share it with one another, not right

923
01:03:41.845 --> 01:03:43.885
before you're going to bed, okay?

924
01:03:44.785 --> 01:03:45.805
In other words, this is

925
01:03:45.805 --> 01:03:49.525
to really more deeply understand each other, okay?

926
01:03:53.505 --> 01:03:55.765
Um, problem for many couples is

927
01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.645
that the only time they talk about sex

928
01:03:57.745 --> 01:03:58.885
is when they're frustrated.

929
01:04:00.275 --> 01:04:02.405
That make sense? I mean, we've been there

930
01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:06.685
and so we're actually encouraging you, number one, see it

931
01:04:06.685 --> 01:04:07.925
as this is a blessing.

932
01:04:08.075 --> 01:04:11.365
Obviously, if you look at the scripture, obviously intended

933
01:04:12.025 --> 01:04:14.565
by God as a gift, um,

934
01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:18.645
but oftentimes we aren't meeting the relational needs

935
01:04:19.175 --> 01:04:23.165
along the way, and therefore it becomes something we do.

936
01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:28.725
And often something we do when we don't necessarily want

937
01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:30.205
to, okay?

938
01:04:30.205 --> 01:04:33.325
And that's not what we want to aim for. Okay?

939
01:04:34.655 --> 01:04:37.155
So lots of freedom, lots of care.

940
01:04:39.295 --> 01:04:43.195
Um, So the lack

941
01:04:43.195 --> 01:04:46.435
of open communication about our sexual relationship,

942
01:04:46.495 --> 01:04:50.355
and it is maybe the most vulnerable

943
01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:53.195
or one of the most vulnerable things to talk about,

944
01:04:53.195 --> 01:04:55.675
because I would say for men

945
01:04:55.815 --> 01:05:00.395
and women, uh, it is one of the most vulnerable places

946
01:05:00.445 --> 01:05:04.435
where all it would take is a disgusting sigh

947
01:05:06.055 --> 01:05:08.675
to destroy your feelings.

948
01:05:09.095 --> 01:05:13.755
You know, something like that. A negative, uh, comment.

949
01:05:14.015 --> 01:05:17.765
So we want it to bless both people and

950
01:05:17.765 --> 01:05:20.765
therefore my job is to bless her.

951
01:05:21.225 --> 01:05:22.565
Her job is to bless me

952
01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:26.845
so we're not taking from one another. That make sense?

953
01:05:27.805 --> 01:05:31.365
I look back to when I was a little girl, I know,

954
01:05:31.455 --> 01:05:34.365
don't ever remember a discussion about it with my mother,

955
01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:38.005
never, or about the time

956
01:05:38.005 --> 01:05:40.485
that I would've been starting a period.

957
01:05:41.465 --> 01:05:43.125
We didn't talk about that either. Mm-Hmm.

958
01:05:43.515 --> 01:05:48.165
Yeah. So that's what I bring to this relationship.

959
01:05:48.355 --> 01:05:51.295
Yeah. So that,

960
01:05:51.845 --> 01:05:54.375
that might've helped if we had had those kinds

961
01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:56.655
of caring conversations with our parents.

962
01:05:57.555 --> 01:06:01.975
Um, and even then when I, you know, I,

963
01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.855
I might have needed more help than that,

964
01:06:03.995 --> 01:06:07.615
but the bottom line is we're trying to bless this

965
01:06:07.715 --> 01:06:09.615
as something that is truly a gift from God.

966
01:06:10.035 --> 01:06:13.575
And yet you can see all the focus we put on relational needs

967
01:06:14.025 --> 01:06:18.415
would be so helpful when it comes to our sexual intimacy.

968
01:06:19.195 --> 01:06:21.495
So just wanna lift that part up.

969
01:06:23.835 --> 01:06:28.185
Um, Any thoughts, questions?

970
01:06:31.495 --> 01:06:35.825
Okay. Um,

971
01:06:37.235 --> 01:06:38.745
there are two handouts, guys.

972
01:06:38.805 --> 01:06:40.225
Get one. Girls get you.

973
01:06:43.035 --> 01:06:44.185
There Should be enough here.

974
01:07:08.565 --> 01:07:11.465
So is this, what's on that barcode on page 1 35?

975
01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:16.225
I think some of us had this, I have not yet.

976
01:07:19.925 --> 01:07:22.545
It should be the same thing. Didn't have this.

977
01:07:22.965 --> 01:07:23.785
It mine is yours.

978
01:07:28.165 --> 01:07:28.385
I'm

979
01:07:28.385 --> 01:07:29.385
Glad you mentioned that. I need

980
01:07:29.385 --> 01:07:30.625
to restate that.

981
01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:35.865
Wait, What is that 1 35?

982
01:07:36.365 --> 01:07:41.105
1 35. Okay. So if you look in your books on page

983
01:07:41.205 --> 01:07:45.505
1 35, Uh, I

984
01:07:45.505 --> 01:07:48.585
Think there's a reference There is at the bottom.

985
01:07:49.535 --> 01:07:53.025
Does it say and Yes. Okay.

986
01:07:53.805 --> 01:07:58.145
So in ER's book, there's a barcode down below,

987
01:07:58.485 --> 01:07:59.985
but in Ed's book there wasn't.

988
01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:04.025
Okay, well it is because of a different printing. Yeah.

989
01:08:05.015 --> 01:08:08.025
Okay. They, they omitted it accidentally.

990
01:08:08.925 --> 01:08:11.505
So if you don't have a QR code,

991
01:08:11.815 --> 01:08:13.785
what I just passed out to you, is it?

992
01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:14.825
Mm-Hmm. Okay.

993
01:08:14.885 --> 01:08:18.325
That'll get you by. But, uh, apparently in this batch

994
01:08:18.325 --> 01:08:20.405
of books we've got two different printers.

995
01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:23.285
So they did fix that.

996
01:08:23.465 --> 01:08:25.525
But, uh, I'm glad you mentioned that

997
01:08:25.765 --> 01:08:27.405
'cause I was just assuming it's been fixed.

998
01:08:28.725 --> 01:08:32.365
Thoughts, questions. Is this working?

999
01:08:33.625 --> 01:08:35.485
Is this okay? Yeah. Alright.

1000
01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:38.925
We got one more meeting and it's kind of a wrap up meeting,

1001
01:08:39.065 --> 01:08:41.685
but, um, you've got a few more days in your book

1002
01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:47.445
and, uh, I just encourage you, um, uh,

1003
01:08:48.475 --> 01:08:50.485
keep the process, if you've ever gotten behind

1004
01:08:50.485 --> 01:08:53.805
during these weeks, uh, just encourage you, uh,

1005
01:08:54.305 --> 01:08:55.365
circle the wagons

1006
01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:58.925
and pick up those other days, uh, later on.

1007
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.925
And, uh, we just want to kind of serve you

1008
01:09:01.945 --> 01:09:04.525
by getting you into this material as well as we can.

1009
01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:07.605
And, uh, do you have anything else you wanted to say?

1010
01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.605
You want to close this in prayer? Sure. Okay.

1011
01:09:16.115 --> 01:09:18.485
What a wonderful group of people we've had this time.

1012
01:09:18.665 --> 01:09:21.525
We thank you for bringing each and every couple to us

1013
01:09:22.585 --> 01:09:25.885
and pray that we'll be able to, Bruce

1014
01:09:25.985 --> 01:09:29.605
and I to continue to live out these principles

1015
01:09:30.185 --> 01:09:33.205
to honor you and every couple here.

1016
01:09:33.945 --> 01:09:36.165
And we pray it in Jesus' name. Amen.
