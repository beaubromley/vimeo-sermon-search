00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:03.325
Good morning church.

2
00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.005
What a wonderful day to celebrate our Lord and King.

3
00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.885
Just a few weeks ago, the high school ministry, um,

4
00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:13.565
entered into a time where they went

5
00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:18.045
and lived on mission here in, uh,

6
00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:20.205
locally in the town of Edmond.

7
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:23.565
And these next three baptisms are a testimony

8
00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:26.925
to the Lord's saving work, uh, during that time.

9
00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:30.125
So this is Mackenzie Foche

10
00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:34.485
and she is part of that story.

11
00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.165
Um, she was just put on fire by the Lord from

12
00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:40.405
that mission strip and she's come today to be baptized.

13
00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:44.805
So Mackenzie, upon your profession of faith, I baptized you,

14
00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:47.405
my sister, in the name of the father, the son,

15
00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:48.405
and the Holy Spirit.
