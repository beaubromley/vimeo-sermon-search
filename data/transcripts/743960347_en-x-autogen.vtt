1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
Who is the god

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.300
like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.300
of wrath the god of Mercy The God

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.700
Who reaches down to unworthy people.

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200
Well, good morning. Again Church. My name is John. I get the

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.200
privilege of preaching most weeks here and it is

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.500
an honor to get to serve our faith family. That way if I

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.200
haven't met you yet, please come say hi. I love meeting people love to

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.700
connect with you. Especially if you're new, please let us connect you

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.400
to our church as best we can today. We're

11
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.300
continuing our series through the Book of Micah. We're in week

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
three. Now. She go ahead and turn to Micah as you turn

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200
there. Let me get us started by telling you about a man.

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.300
I was talking to Alan Rice this week about him a man

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.100
named Cornelius Vanderbilt.

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.700
You might know that Vanderbilt name Vanderbilt University. Yes. That

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.200
is the same. But Cornelius Vanderbilt. He's

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.300
most well known for being a business tycoon in

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.100
the early to mid 1800s.

20
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.700
And he built his vast Fortune using

21
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.200
railroads and shipping. He was

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.700
one of the wealthiest Americans it's ever lived and he

23
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
is credited with much of the railroad

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.300
system and much of the westward expansion of

25
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.000
the United States back. Then you can point to Vanderbilt

26
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.400
for that.

27
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
And his story really is kind of the American dream Lord of this

28
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
Manifest Destiny idea where you know, he

29
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
knew that he was gonna work hard. He would be able to be successful. He was

30
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
gonna make it all of that. It would pay off and he saw

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.400
he started in his father's company. He helped build that

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.500
up and then began to start all his own new Ventures and

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.300
it ended up to this this vast Fortune.

34
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
So we kind of look at that and we're like man that that's a capitalist hero right

35
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.400
there. Right? Like he is the guy that where he looks to it's success story

36
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.200
all those things and you add to

37
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
the fact that he also claimed to follow Jesus. He was

38
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.100
Moravian. He claimed to follow Christ. So you look at all

39
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
that and we could tend to think that surely God was

40
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.700
blessing him for his work ethic and his faith and

41
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.400
look what he was such a success.

42
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.500
When I leave out of that story.

43
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.600
See as Vanderbilt was building his Empire.

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.000
What you don't often hear about?

45
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.600
Are the hundreds of people who were killed building those

46
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.300
railroads?

47
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.300
Or the workers who were oppressed and did

48
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300
all of that hard labor for pennies were treated

49
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.500
terribly.

50
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.000
We always hear about all the good that Vanderbilt and

51
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.100
many others have done throughout history. We're thankful for

52
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.900
a lot of that in America, but we forget

53
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.100
All of the people that they stepped on to

54
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.200
get to their success.

55
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.200
It's maybe not as blessed as we think it is, right.

56
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.200
Here's what God's going to do with this mirror of God's

57
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.000
word today.

58
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.600
She might just shine that into your own heart.

59
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.900
into my heart

60
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.100
to show us

61
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.100
where we might be on the same pathway.

62
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.400
And we'll see a similar situation to what I just described actually in

63
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.100
Micah chapter 2. So if you're not

64
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.200
already there, let's find Micah chapter 2. I'm going to read verses

65
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.400
1 through 11 and show you.

66
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.500
Exactly the same thing.

67
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.600
Woe to those who devise wickedness and work

68
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600
evil on their beds.

69
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.600
When the morning Dawns they perform it because it's

70
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.900
in the power of their hands.

71
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.900
They covet fields and sees them and houses and

72
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.400
take them away. They oppress a man

73
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.900
in his house a man and his inheritance.

74
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.000
Therefore this says the Lord.

75
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.000
Behold against this family. I'm devising disaster.

76
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.700
From which you cannot remove your necks?

77
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.300
And you shall not walk haughtily or pridefully for it

78
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.700
will be a time of disaster.

79
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.800
In that day, they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan

80
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.100
bitterly.

81
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.900
And say we are utterly ruined.

82
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.200
He changed the portion of my people. He removes it

83
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.400
from me to an apostate or a foreigner. He

84
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.600
allots our fields.

85
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.200
Therefore you will have none to cast the line by

86
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.800
law in the Assembly of the Lord.

87
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.600
Do not preach thus they preach one should

88
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.500
not preach of such things disgrace will not overtake

89
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.800
us.

90
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.700
Should this be said oh House of Jacob?

91
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.500
Has the Lord grown impatient are these his

92
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.900
deeds?

93
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.100
Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly.

94
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.800
But lately my people have risen up as an enemy you strip

95
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.700
the rich robe from those who pass by trustingly without

96
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.600
the thought of War.

97
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.300
The women of my people you drive out from their delightful houses

98
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.600
from their young children. You take away my Splendor forever.

99
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.200
Arise and go this is no place to rest because of

100
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.700
uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction.

101
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.800
If a man should go about an utter wind and lies saying

102
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.500
I will preach to you of wine and strong drink.

103
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.200
He would be the preacher for this people.

104
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.900
There's a lot to pick through there. We'll come back and see all through

105
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.900
it again. But we we need to start by

106
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.000
considering the reasons for God's judgment here.

107
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.000
See if you remember chapter one. We saw this kind of generic judgment

108
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.900
God's gonna bring on his people. They've obviously sinned

109
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.400
here now, he starts to label out some of the specific

110
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.600
things they were doing

111
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300
And what we'll find here is that there's actually three we're gonna

112
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.100
summarize them into three two of them are going to take today the third one

113
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.200
shows up a lot more later. And so we'll take that later in

114
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.700
the series. But the two that we're going to look at today are

115
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.500
reasons for God's judgment.

116
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.600
The first one is this.

117
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.500
Covetous oppression

118
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.300
first reason for God's judgment on in the nation here

119
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.100
is Covetous oppression.

120
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.200
And we saw it, right?

121
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.700
In Micah's day, there was this powerful group of people abusing

122
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.600
the rights of others.

123
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.800
These were leaders and influential figures that were casting off

124
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.700
the Commandments of God and they were instead living for

125
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.300
their own Pleasures living for their own selfish gain.

126
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.600
brazenly abusing their power

127
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.400
stealing things during the daylight right now. If you're

128
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.500
gonna steal something, it's probably best to do it at night. They don't care they're doing

129
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.200
it during the day because they have the power in their hand. It says

130
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.700
they can do it.

131
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.700
Just a Brazen abuse.

132
00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.200
power

133
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.000
but notice the oppression had a source.

134
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.900
It was covetousness.

135
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.800
That's the word in verse 2 to covet. It means a strong desire

136
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.500
for someone else's possessions.

137
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.100
Or even something like to take Pleasure in

138
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.500
someone else's stuff to even lust after

139
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.800
someone else's property.

140
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.100
And this is direct Rebellion.

141
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.400
To the tenth of the famous Ten Commandments the tenth commandment

142
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.700
says do not covet.

143
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.800
Do not Cove at all of these other they list out a bunch of things and they are directly going

144
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.200
against that not only that they're opposing

145
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.500
God, but they're crimes had a

146
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.900
deep effect on other people.

147
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.500
Not just because those people lost their stuff but because in

148
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.500
doing so they lost their identity.

149
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.700
Because remember that's where their status in the community rested.

150
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.600
their household their their Dwelling Place their

151
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.200
land

152
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.200
that they're inheritance came through that and so to take it

153
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.800
away from them meant they they lost their place in

154
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.000
the community essentially.

155
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.800
And so these people were sinning against God and oppressing others

156
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.400
by overpowering them by treating them

157
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.400
unjustly by burdening them unnecessarily all

158
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.200
of that was over them and notice it was all in the

159
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.700
name of economic growth.

160
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.000
Just want more. We want more we want more.

161
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.300
And this is the result.

162
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.400
See, that's why God was going to judge him.

163
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.500
And in verse 5 it says he was going to take their land away and give

164
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.400
it to another give it to an apostate a

165
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.000
foreigner.

166
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.400
Where they wouldn't even be able to own the land in the future. That's what verse 5 means

167
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.200
whenever they were Distributing by lot. Meaning they

168
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.600
were tossing dice essentially that that was how they distributed the

169
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.400
land in numbers.

170
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.200
And God says I'm going to take even that away

171
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.200
from you where you're gonna lose your land now and you won't ever be

172
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.300
able to own it in the future.

173
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.400
And he says that they will not be able to walk around in this

174
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.100
Pride this arrogance that they had before because

175
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.300
instead of what they've been doing to somebody else

176
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.000
to the poor. They've been oppressing and standing on

177
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.400
their neck. Now. God says it's gonna flip around and those

178
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.700
oppressors are going to come on to you.

179
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.000
The enemy is going to overtake you gonna take

180
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.100
you into Exile and you are now going

181
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.600
to have the yolk around your neck.

182
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.100
And it leads to this lament in verse 4.

183
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.400
This taunt song it says not Katy Perry's

184
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.000
fight song. It says taunt song here.

185
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.500
But notice it's a it's a taunt that they apparently had

186
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.600
been saying to the poor before and

187
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.900
the poor were crying out in response. Now, these

188
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.400
oppressors are gonna feel it the same way.

189
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.200
They're gonna cry out in the same way that those poor people

190
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.000
had for many years.

191
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.100
Everything they've been doing to the other people now was going to be done

192
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.600
to them.

193
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.300
Now as we think about how this applies today.

194
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.400
How do we bring this 2700 years to us?

195
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.000
You might be hearing this and reading this like I don't have a problem

196
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.200
with that.

197
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.300
I'm not stealing stuff from anybody.

198
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.100
Not like lusting after vehicles that

199
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.700
drive by me on the interstate. That's not me man. What are you talking about?

200
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.200
This is their problem, but actually when we start to

201
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.800
dig a deeper into coveting.

202
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.500
Start to get to the heart of the matter.

203
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.500
The essence of coveting is that I need

204
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.500
something that I do not

205
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.800
now have to make me happy.

206
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.300
Right. I need something in my life

207
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.300
that I don't currently have yet. And if I get that

208
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.300
thing then I will be fulfilled. That's the essence of

209
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.500
coveting.

210
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.100
So you think about it that way that sucks all of us

211
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.800
in then right?

212
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.100
Because we've all been there we all get there. It gets

213
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.200
to the heart. It's like Jesus in The Sermon on the Mount.

214
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.800
And he says to the people he's like, yeah, you've never murdered anybody. Okay, but

215
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.400
if you are angry in your heart towards them

216
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.400
if you have unforgiveness in your heart towards them then it's just

217
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.400
like you murdered him.

218
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.700
It's as much a sin before God as that

219
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:37.900
is.

220
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.100
So he says it right here, right? No, you never stole anything.

221
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.200
but think

222
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.100
what's your heart motivation for how you live your life?

223
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.100
Is it greed?

224
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.100
More I want more accumulating.

225
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.800
Is it dissatisfaction?

226
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.500
With where you're at. What what you have what God has given you

227
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.900
is it dissatisfaction? Here's the problem with that what

228
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.700
that means is that you're not then satisfied

229
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.300
in God.

230
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.100
If you're dissatisfied in life, you say well, I need

231
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.300
this. I'm looking for something else to be my joy something

232
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.600
else to fulfill me that I need.

233
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.700
It's saying to God, you're not enough.

234
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.300
That he in his goodness is not enough for you.

235
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.000
Which by the way I'm sorry if you work in

236
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.000
marketing, but this is the whole essence of advertising, isn't it?

237
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.400
It's creating a dissatisfied state

238
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.000
of life.

239
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.400
So all the sudden you finally realizing. Yeah, I really do need to buy Flex Seal.

240
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.900
I never knew that like I just like

241
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.500
that's this point is that there's creating dissatisfaction. So

242
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.700
you think this is gonna fulfillment I need that.

243
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.400
It's just living out what first John 2.

244
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.000
verses 15 and 16 say negatively

245
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.200
It says do not love the world or the things in the

246
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.400
world.

247
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.400
If anyone loves the world the love of the father is

248
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.100
not in him.

249
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.800
For all that is in the world.

250
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.200
Now check this the desires of the flesh.

251
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.700
The desires of the eyes that's the lust the

252
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.700
coveting and the pride of life.

253
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.400
I can do whatever.

254
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.200
Is not from the father, but it's from

255
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.400
the world.

256
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.900
Now we need to be careful to make a distinction here.

257
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.100
Because what this could lead to is like well, I can't

258
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.100
have any desires then.

259
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.300
Just got to kind of lay down and take it right. No, there are actually healthy

260
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.100
desires as well.

261
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.600
I mean just think about it.

262
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.200
a single person who wants to be married

263
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.500
you think about that woman who wants to find a job so

264
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.200
she can provide for her family better like that. That's those are

265
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.400
good healthy desires as long as those

266
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.800
things don't become idols.

267
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.200
As long as you're not coveting what somebody

268
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.800
else has like man, I wish I was married to that but like that's coveting. No,

269
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.700
it's not that it's if it's done in

270
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.300
a healthy way that God gives us good desires.

271
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.800
They're right.

272
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.200
But what happens when coveting starts to enter the

273
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.500
mix?

274
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.600
Is like with Cornelius Vanderbilt?

275
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.500
Coveting begins to lead you towards compromise.

276
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.700
It leads you towards.

277
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.400
Stepping on other people's shoulders to

278
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.100
get that desire that you have.

279
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.900
It leads you to begin to see others as objects for

280
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.700
your pleasure.

281
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.400
Or as something to be used to get what

282
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:08.900
you really want.

283
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.500
Now you see how this can go really badly, right?

284
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.200
This is where adultery comes from.

285
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.600
Just wanting something else. This is where pornography comes

286
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.100
from that you are used for my pleasure. That's where

287
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.500
underpaying employees comes because I just want more profit. That's

288
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.100
where lying comes from robbery comes from

289
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.600
abuse comes from is that I want something from

290
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.200
you and I'm going to use you to get it.

291
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.400
It all comes from the heart root of covetousness.

292
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.300
Which then if you have any power over someone else that's what

293
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.300
leads to oppression.

294
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.200
It's exactly what we see in Micah 2.

295
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.100
We see it all the time here.

296
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.000
in our lives

297
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.800
Okay, so clearly we don't want that.

298
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.400
That's set this stage for the negative. What do

299
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.300
we do to fight against that selfish desire?

300
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.300
Like what's a practical step that I can take to

301
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.300
combat this coveting that leads to oppression at times

302
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:20.700
of others.

303
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.700
Now we can take this one way where we go into kind of like the systemic part

304
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.100
of our culture and how the financial system works and we

305
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.500
can get into that and I'm sure there's tweaks we can make to make that better.

306
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.300
But what about for us individually?

307
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.900
How do we as individuals fight covetousness in

308
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.300
our own hearts?

309
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.500
Well, one of our values is a church is reimagine

310
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.000
generosity.

311
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.700
We use everything that God's given us time Talent treasure all

312
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.400
of that for his purposes first that's

313
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.500
reimagined generosity because think about what these

314
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.400
people in Micah 2 should have been doing

315
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.500
the wealthy people instead of taking more

316
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.500
from the poor.

317
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.600
They should have instead flipped around and used

318
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.800
their wealth to bless the poor to care

319
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.100
for them.

320
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.800
Because that's what God intended all throughout his word.

321
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.800
See it everywhere, but just listen to Psalm 82 verses 3

322
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.500
and 4. It says give Justice to the weak

323
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.200
and fatherless.

324
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.900
maintain the right of The Afflicted and the destitute rescue

325
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.200
the weak and the needy

326
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.300
Deliver them from the hand of the

327
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.600
wicked meaning they're already oppressed. You should work to

328
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.300
deliver them from that.

329
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.500
It's not just Old Testament Galatians 2:10. Remember the poor

330
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.500
James 1 True Religion verse 27

331
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.300
cares for the widows cares for the orphans which

332
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.700
by the way were the ones who are the most oppressed back then.

333
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.500
Care for them find ways to serve them

334
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.100
because here's what that sacrificial generosity does.

335
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.500
As we start to to shift our mindset to it

336
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.000
what it does is it counteracts our natural desires

337
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.000
for our own selfish coveting and

338
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.500
greed.

339
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.200
Like when you intentionally make an effort to be generous.

340
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.500
That is the antidote to the poison of coveting.

341
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.400
It flips it and it says I'm going to give instead of

342
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.200
take.

343
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.800
No hear me.

344
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.800
It's not wrong to acquire wealth.

345
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.500
We're not saying anything about that. What we're

346
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.400
saying is you just better hold it Loosely as you

347
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.100
attach deeply to the Lord.

348
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.800
It's gonna call you to give and sacrifice and and use

349
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.300
it for his kingdom Hold it more Loosely as you

350
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:49.900
attach more deeply.

351
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.500
So when we look at all this, this is a heart check for us, isn't it?

352
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.200
We have to ask the question.

353
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.400
You and I we need to ask the question of ourselves. Is

354
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.300
there any hint of coveting in my

355
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:07.500
life?

356
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.500
Is there any desire I have that I'm looking for

357
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.100
something instead of looking for God to fulfill it.

358
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.400
I lost this thing and I'm grieving

359
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.200
that loss instead of just saying I'm content with where God

360
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.600
has me.

361
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.200
Is there any hint of coveting? Am I

362
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.200
more focused on things and money than I am on the

363
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.000
kingdom of God.

364
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.200
You know you saw here in Micah 2 these.

365
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.400
These influential wealthy people were were laying in

366
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.300
bed at night plotting how to make more money and

367
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.600
how to to steal more stuff and grow their their

368
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.800
net worth. That's what they were plotting out. What if instead

369
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.300
of scheming at night for ways to climb

370
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:53.700
the ladder.

371
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.500
What if we laid awake at night devising plans

372
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.600
to help the hurting and the homeless and

373
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.100
the hungry?

374
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.300
And you can't sleep at night not because you're trying to figure out how to grow your business. You're trying

375
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.300
to you're not sleep at night. You're trying to figure out how you can help more people.

376
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.100
See how that complete opposite.

377
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.500
That's the antidote.

378
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.300
The ways to give instead of the ways to

379
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:21.600
take.

380
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.700
And here's one easy way to get there.

381
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.300
When you remember we said this a lot in the last few months you remember

382
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.800
you're not an owner of any of this.

383
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.100
Like you don't own the clothes on your back. You don't own your house. You don't

384
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.700
own your stuff all your money. It's not yours. God owns

385
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.000
it all.

386
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.600
And what he asks of you to be is a generous steward.

387
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.200
To invest his kingdom in his

388
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.600
vest his resources for his glory.

389
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.200
When you remember, it's not yours. You can be open-handed with it.

390
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.200
Say all right God you use it. However, you want to it's What

391
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.300
First Timothy chapter 6 verses 17 through 19

392
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.600
says this this thought prose should be in our minds as

393
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.100
for the rich in this present age charge

394
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.300
them not to be haughty or prideful or

395
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.200
selfish nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of

396
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.600
riches.

397
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.100
But to set their hopes on God.

398
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.900
Who richly provides us with everything to enjoy?

399
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.100
They are to do good to be

400
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.900
rich in Good Works to be generous to

401
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.700
be ready to share.

402
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.400
Thus storing up treasure for themselves a good foundation for the future

403
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.400
so that they may take hold of that which is

404
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.200
truly life.

405
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.500
It's an interesting comparison. He says that your stuff and wealth

406
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.900
and riches in this world is not truly life.

407
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.000
Living for the kingdom of God as a steward is life.

408
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.700
Let's see Abundant Life.

409
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.800
Now I want you to think about something.

410
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.300
About how you are feeling already having heard

411
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:03.600
all of this.

412
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.000
Think about how Micah's original hearers would have

413
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.700
been hearing all of this.

414
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.500
Do you think they would have been enjoying hearing this

415
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.000
judgment on them coming? Right? Well, they

416
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.200
have the engine. No, they would have been like

417
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.900
What's wrong with you Mike?

418
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.000
I've been hurt it would've been critique.

419
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.100
In fact, they did in verse 6. I tried to get

420
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:28.500
him to stop.

421
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.200
But that leads us to the second reason for God's

422
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.800
judgment here.

423
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.800
It's what I refer to as ear tickling unbelief.

424
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.300
We saw Covetous oppression. As one reason God's gonna bring judgment on his people

425
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.500
irickling unbelief is the

426
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.900
second we're going to talk about here now when the world is that

427
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.100
So like when the old man comes up to you and takes a quarter out of

428
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.400
your ear like that. You're tickling kind of feel like no that's not where anything we're

429
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.400
talking about with actual hands and ears we're

430
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:00.900
talking about.

431
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.200
The fact that Micah's audience did not want

432
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.100
to listen to God's word through Micah.

433
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.300
In fact, they would much rather have listened to what verse

434
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.400
11 says this guy preach about which beer

435
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.400
and wine to drink.

436
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.300
You see that right? That's what it says verse 11. If a

437
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.500
man should go about an utter wind and lies saying I

438
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.500
will preach to you of wine and strong drink. He would

439
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.500
be the preacher for this people.

440
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.200
Let's be like you come to church and they're like here's this

441
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.300
one. And this one is where you spent why she picked this one like it's just meaningless,

442
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:35.500
right?

443
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.700
But that's what they wanted to hear.

444
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.700
See, that's the point.

445
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.400
In verse 6. They said Micah don't teach us these hard

446
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:45.500
things.

447
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.000
Micah why can't you just make us feel good?

448
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.100
That's the ear tickling side, right? It's supposed to make you

449
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.700
feel better. Whatever you're listening to.

450
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.300
I said Micah. Can you not just tell us what we want to hear? But listen,

451
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.700
that's the whole point of why they got in this mess

452
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.300
right? They said that because they didn't believe they

453
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.100
were at any risk.

454
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.800
And Michael why can't you just make us feel better?

455
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.400
Verse 6 disgrace will not overtake us Micah don't you know your

456
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:17.900
theology?

457
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.000
I mean my Micah don't you know God's not going to

458
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.100
judge us. We're his people remember Exodus 34.

459
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.100
What's your number? That God is is patient. He's compassionate.

460
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.000
He's slow to anger. He's abounding his

461
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.600
steadfast love Micah. Don't you remember what God

462
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.600
said about himself. He's not going to do anything to us. We're his

463
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:38.700
people.

464
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.100
Why would you tell us he's going to judge us? There's no way

465
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.200
he's going to judge us.

466
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.000
The problem was that they were only half right about the character of God.

467
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.500
Because Micah says you're right.

468
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.600
God will bless those who follow his

469
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.600
ways who walk uprightly he

470
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.100
will bless those.

471
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.700
but Micah in verses 8 through 11 looks down at these people and he says

472
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.000
You're not.

473
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.900
You're not living up rightly. Look at what you've been doing.

474
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.500
He says you are stealing land. You're taking clothes

475
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.500
right off people's backs. You're repossessing widows

476
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.500
houses. You're forcing children to live on the

477
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:26.800
street.

478
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.700
So Micah looks at them and he says it doesn't matter if you're a Hebrew

479
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.500
or a not it doesn't matter. God will

480
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.900
never bless that kind of life.

481
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.300
Whoever your father is, it doesn't matter if you're Abraham's lineage God's Not

482
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.000
Gonna bless that.

483
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.400
But don't forget where all this ties back.

484
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.800
See the root of their sinful Behavior.

485
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.500
The reason they were living like that was they

486
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.200
did not believe the right things about God.

487
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:01.700
right

488
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.600
They completely abandoned the Covenant principles.

489
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.500
God had given them.

490
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.700
they misunderstood and said

491
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.100
God will ever judge us.

492
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.500
They didn't get God's character, right? They thought

493
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.700
he was this when he was actually this.

494
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.800
And now even further they embraced these ear tickling

495
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.600
prophets just told them what they wanted to hear meaningless nothings.

496
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.500
Church do we

497
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.000
not see this happening around us just as much

498
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.300
today.

499
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.600
Do we not have people in our day who are who are

500
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.600
putting God in a humanly constructed box that limits

501
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.500
him to certain things.

502
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.400
Do we not have people saying?

503
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.600
Surely God can't be like that.

504
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.900
Whenever his word says that's exactly who he is.

505
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.500
Or people who only focus on the blessings of

506
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:09.700
God.

507
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.100
without the standards he has

508
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.900
or people who look the other way whenever they see oppression

509
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.100
happen and they just kind of like

510
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.700
Not my problem.

511
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.200
Do we not have people limiting God's love to those

512
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.700
who look and act like us.

513
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.000
Or that God loves us because fill in

514
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.100
the blank.

515
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.400
Or we just assume that we are always right

516
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.400
and they are always wrong.

517
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.500
Just look at our political system, right?

518
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.300
So not only all that. We also at the same time have

519
00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.100
people who are claiming to be followers of Christ who are repelled by

520
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.400
the truth of God's word.

521
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.900
They're just looking for that irickling feel. Good message.

522
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:11.700
now

523
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.700
let me clear. I'm not saying that a preacher has to be a jerk to

524
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.700
be faithful to God's word.

525
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.800
You don't have to be.

526
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.400
But the reality is that there are people who don't like to be told that

527
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.700
parts of their life are wrong.

528
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.500
Who don't like to read God's word and say Jesus

529
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.700
you came and you told us to die to ourselves.

530
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.400
I don't like that. I have to give up a lot of things

531
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.500
or or they don't like to be told that we're all on Mission

532
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.400
that you are included in the mission of God, just like I am every one

533
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.500
of us.

534
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.000
Was happening back then.

535
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400
Is still happening today?

536
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.600
That's why the Apostle Paul told young Pastor Timothy.

537
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.600
This in second Timothy chapter 4 verse

538
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.100
2. He said hey Timothy preach the word.

539
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.200
Preach the word.

540
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.000
The word of God be ready in season and out of

541
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.500
season meaning all the time reprove rebuke.

542
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.800
And exhort with complete patience and

543
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.500
teaching.

544
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.300
So Timothy's reading this and he's like, hey Paul, you know,

545
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.800
I mean, I'm gonna have to say some hard stuff man.

546
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.700
God's word got some hard things and I've just say that stuff.

547
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.800
Paul's like yeah

548
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.800
Verse 3 for the time is coming when people will not endure sound

549
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.300
or healthy teaching but having

550
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.200
itching ears. That's the ear tickling idea. They will

551
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.300
accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own

552
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.100
Passions.

553
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.800
We'll turn away from listening to the truth and wander off

554
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.700
into myths.

555
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.100
One of my favorite preachers is Charles Spurgeon. He restated

556
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.200
that verse in his own distinctive way as he

557
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.300
does. He says a time will come when instead of

558
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.300
shepherds feeding the Sheep the church will have

559
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.100
clowns entertaining the goats.

560
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.500
And so instead of slipping into that pitch.

561
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.300
We must be anchored in the truth of

562
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:18.800
God's word.

563
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.600
We cannot deviate from it. We commit

564
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.900
to that here. That's one of our values as a church anchoring truth,

565
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.600
right? This is the source of all of

566
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.300
our Doctrine all of our Lives because

567
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.700
remember what got them. Astray was misunderstanding God's

568
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.200
character.

569
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.500
They didn't have a full understanding of who he was so

570
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.500
that means we must get our theology, right?

571
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.100
Our study of God our understanding of who God is we've got

572
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.600
to get that right but hear me.

573
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.200
It must be a humble theology.

574
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.100
What I mean by that is that we as humans are

575
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.500
willing to change and willing

576
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.300
to live differently according to

577
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.700
what God is like.

578
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.500
See we can get all our theology right on paper.

579
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.700
We have great discussions about Theology and Doctrine and we can debate and

580
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.200
have great discussions all over that. We can then put our

581
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.200
Doctrine badge up on the bulletin board. Like we earned it

582
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.400
with Awana. We got it. Like I've got it figured out.

583
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.200
But James 1 says that we're not changed to buy it,

584
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.400
then we are actually deceived by

585
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:33.800
it.

586
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.500
James 1:22 through 25 says be doers of

587
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.000
the word not here is only

588
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.400
not study yours only not just understanders only

589
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.700
but be doers of it be changed by

590
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.000
it because here's what happens you can.

591
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.400
You can grow this Megamind like head where

592
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.300
you know it all but your heart is the size of

593
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.000
a marble.

594
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.200
You can know it all.

595
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.200
But not live it at all.

596
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.300
That's a dangerous place to be.

597
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.900
And so this is humble theology.

598
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.400
Where as you rightly desire to learn more about God

599
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.300
that is good. It's right the nature and

600
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.700
character of God when you know more about who he is understand who he is, but

601
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.400
then at the same time we learn how

602
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.500
to align ourselves with that truth

603
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.400
of who God is

604
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.200
We're willing humble to change even if it moves

605
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.300
us outside of our box.

606
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.500
Even if it challenges something that you grew up hearing over

607
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.100
and over again.

608
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.700
Even if it pushes you to confront that

609
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.200
Covetous oppression in your own life, even when

610
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.800
it pushes you past where you thought you would ever go. However

611
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.700
God's word moves you it's willing to

612
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.300
change your life to match it.

613
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.500
humble theology

614
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.200
To open your hands up and in case of

615
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.300
Micah 2 to reimagine your generosity that's saying

616
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.600
maybe it's not all about just what I can get more and more and more and accumulate and

617
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.400
grow and store up barns, right? That's not maybe it's

618
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:15.900
not about that.

619
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800
That's the world says that.

620
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.700
Even churches said that in some ways. It's not about that. Jesus says to

621
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.400
be generous to give to to count your

622
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.500
life as nothing and and give it all away.

623
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.000
to fall in

624
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.500
maybe he means that.

625
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.000
We're willing to change.

626
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:39.700
So Micah.

627
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.800
God used him to point out to these people.

628
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.800
Their Covetous oppression their ear tickling unbelief, and

629
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.900
he said judgments coming.

630
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.400
But we're not finished with Micah too yet.

631
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.000
See, there's one more piece of this puzzle here, and this is meant to

632
00:33:59.600 --> 00:33:59.900
Spur us on.

633
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.500
I know all of this and really most weeks of Micah will

634
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.200
feel this way where it's all judgment judgment judgment judgment.

635
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.700
And it's a part of who God is yes.

636
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.300
but don't miss

637
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.000
The end chapter 2 don't miss these threads

638
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.600
throughout.

639
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.400
Because here's what happens as you look around as as you watch a

640
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.200
culture go further and further away from God

641
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.800
as Micah watched his people drift from God's covenant

642
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.900
as we watch a culture drift towards destruction

643
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.600
as we see that man what it does. Is it

644
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.300
stirs in us a desire for something more right?

645
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.200
Like we look around and we say God. When are you going to

646
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.600
bring the the judgment on the oppressors? When are

647
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.300
you going to fix things when you gonna make it right? When are we

648
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.700
going to get out of this prison that we're in that's where oppressed

649
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.300
by the enemy and then the world like how God are

650
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.500
you going to do this? And when?

651
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.100
Micah points us to the source of God's blessing here.

652
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.200
We saw the reasons for his judgment. But now he says hey hold up. There's

653
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.500
actually a source of blessing.

654
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.800
a source of blessing here

655
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.700
These are the two verses I didn't read at the beginning on purpose versus

656
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.100
12 and 13. Look at what Micah writes.

657
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.400
I will surely assemble All of You O Jacob. I

658
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.200
will gather the remnant of Israel. I will set them

659
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.500
together like sheep in a fold like a flock in

660
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.700
its pasture a noisy multitude of men.

661
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.600
He who opens the breach or the Gap goes up

662
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.500
before them? They break through and

663
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.500
pass the gate going out by it their King

664
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.800
passes on before them the Lord at their head.

665
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.300
So we're gonna get into this you're gonna see how this is building us

666
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.700
towards something, but this is interesting because in verse 12 God's talking.

667
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.300
Right, he's saying here's what I promise to do for my people who

668
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.200
trust me and what he's doing is he's promising a Deliverance.

669
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.200
When he looked at this the source of blessing. It's this

670
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.100
Deliverance that God has promised for his people.

671
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.600
That's what he says here with this remnant.

672
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.400
This group of people who are not Believers in name only. These are

673
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.500
people who actually trust God.

674
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.400
He's going to gather them and say I'm gonna pull you together

675
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.600
like a flock of sheep.

676
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.900
Surrounding them protecting them. They're in

677
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.600
a pasture. They're joyfully noisy. There's no

678
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.300
fear. There's only pleasure. There's excitement. There's

679
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.900
there's all of that that happens around this.

680
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.400
Man, when you look at this, this is not the same picture that Jesus paints and

681
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.700
Luke 15 of the Good Shepherd.

682
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.200
Remember that Parable the one sheep wanders off

683
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.200
and the shepherd loves it enough to go after it and

684
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.300
get it and when it finds it, it pulls it back and they

685
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.100
rejoice and they celebrate and they have a party.

686
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.200
This is the same idea.

687
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.100
And we church we have the privilege of looking back at this through the

688
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.800
lens of Jesus.

689
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.200
We put on our Jesus glasses and we see what he's talking about

690
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.600
here in Micah 2 what we know then is coming forward

691
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.900
for what for us. One day church. This whole

692
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.600
thing is coming from Jesus as

693
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.100
our Good Shepherd to save us redeem us and

694
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.000
collect us just like this.

695
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.100
That if we're a part of his faith family by trusting

696
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.900
his life death and Resurrection in our place.

697
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.300
Man, what we're going to see happen is he's throwing this sheep party

698
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.900
just for us as well as worthy of Celebration.

699
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.300
He's going to gather Us in he's going to make us a noisy

700
00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.200
multitude where he's protecting us. His arms are around

701
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.000
us. This is coming from our Good Shepherd.

702
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.300
But that's not even all.

703
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.900
Because in verse 13 Micah starts talking God talked

704
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.300
in verse 12 now Micah starts talking and he's referring

705
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.200
to Yahweh. Who's not this time a Shepherd this time. He's

706
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.100
a warrior who's going to battle for his people.

707
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.200
Because remember chapter one we saw God come down off the

708
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.100
mountain and he was treading on our high places. He was

709
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.300
he was kind of judging by stepping all

710
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.700
over and showing his power that way now it

711
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.800
shifts to where he's breaking down the walls of

712
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.500
their prison and he's leading them out in

713
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.800
glorious Triumph.

714
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.100
I remember as a kid when I went to San Francisco with my

715
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.300
family. We went to Alcatraz Alcatraz is

716
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.700
the island prison off the coast of San Francisco and

717
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.400
it is probably where the it is

718
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.600
where most probably the famous most famous

719
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.700
prison escape ever was attempted.

720
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.400
And so these men were trying to break out of Alcatraz.

721
00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.300
They didn't undercover of Darkness. It was all hidden. They were

722
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.000
trying to stay in the darkness and the Shadows because they could have

723
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.100
been shot on sight.

724
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.100
It's incredibly interesting story to walk through in all of

725
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.100
that. They tried to break out of that prison.

726
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.000
But that's not Micah's prison break here, right?

727
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.800
See that was done under the cover of Darkness. They were trying to hide

728
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.100
so that they could get out. This says their

729
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.200
King passes on before them. Yahweh

730
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.300
is at their head.

731
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.700
What that means is that he's going out first and he

732
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.800
is going out publicly.

733
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.300
I don't know about you. But when I read that the first time through

734
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.700
my Jesus lenses when I looked at that, I don't know where your mind

735
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.500
went, but my mind went to Jesus busting out

736
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.600
of that grave alive on the third day.

737
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.600
when he broke open the breach your king goes out first

738
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.200
because what I know in second Corinthians 2:14, is

739
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.900
that when Jesus did that he was leading out a triumphal

740
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.400
procession it says

741
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.700
You know what? That is. That's a Victory Parade.

742
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.700
That's where he is on the front car or

743
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.200
whatever. He's riding. It's White Horse. Let's just say that way

744
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.400
right he's on the front of the parade. He's coming down the street and

745
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.700
everybody's cheering to clap and say there's the winner. There's the

746
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.100
Victor. That's who he is.

747
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.500
And you know, who else is in that parade?

748
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.300
Man, this is good news. There's there's other people in that parade,

749
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:24.600
right?

750
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.200
Because he says it here.

751
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.500
That as his headship as his first

752
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.200
fruits of the Resurrection comes out and

753
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.200
he's the Victor showing Deliverance Deliverance for

754
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.500
who just for him. No for all the people in the parade with

755
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:40.700
him.

756
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.200
That all of those who trusted in his life death and

757
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.300
Resurrection are in that Eternal Victory Parade with

758
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.400
him.

759
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.500
like you see that

760
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.600
that he busted out of the prison of sin and shame and death and

761
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.500
he's leading us to come out with him.

762
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.800
And listen, it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor.

763
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.900
it doesn't matter if you

764
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.200
feel oppressed or have been treated negatively or whatever. It

765
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.100
doesn't matter if you've been the oppressor.

766
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.400
If you have repented and believed in Jesus,

767
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.300
then you are in that parade.

768
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.300
With King Jesus at your head at

769
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.200
the front with him leading you out you are in that

770
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.900
parade by faith in Jesus.

771
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.000
Is that not the most satisfying place to be?

772
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.300
When we look around we see the mess of life. We see our

773
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.300
own struggles. This is the most satisfying place to

774
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.600
be believe that church.

775
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.500
believe that

776
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.400
Again, I know some of you have gone through such horrific things

777
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.200
experiences. You've been told certain things about you.

778
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.100
believe this

779
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.500
that you're in that parade by faith in Christ.

780
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.600
Believe that the Victor the winner is

781
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.200
on the front of that parade and he's leading you

782
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.200
out of that prison of sin and shame and questions and

783
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.300
doubts and struggles and all of the past. He's leading you

784
00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.200
out of it one day. This is coming Church.

785
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.600
So let that reality.

786
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.700
Lead you out of the prison that you're walking in right now.

787
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.400
Whatever you feel trapped by.

788
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.200
Whatever you're worried about whatever you're afraid of whatever you're

789
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.100
holding on to from the past. Let this reality that

790
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.400
Jesus Is the Victor leads you out of that prison,

791
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:38.600
too.

792
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.200
right now

793
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.000
First for sin that you're trapped in the prison of

794
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.300
sin and death. You can't get out of yourself. Let him Lead You Out by

795
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.600
faith, but then everything else in your life.

796
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.400
This is who?

797
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.800
opens the gate

798
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.600
for you to walk out of into freedom.

799
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.300
But what that should lead you to shouldn't stop with that.

800
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.100
It's for you as you're walking in that Victory Parade.

801
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.900
For you to turn around and be able to not push

802
00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.300
down other people to get what you want anymore, but

803
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.800
to pull them up with you.

804
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.500
To lift them up and invite them into the parade with

805
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.500
you and say come with me follow our King.

806
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.500
Let me help you. Let me support you. Let me love you. Well, as he's loved

807
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.600
me that's the response day to

808
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:34.700
day.

809
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.200
King has one the eternal battle. There's nothing for

810
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.200
us to worry about he's hymning Us in he's caring for us and

811
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.300
he'll take us home one day and throw a party for us.

812
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.100
Thankful for that, but let's live in light of that today.
