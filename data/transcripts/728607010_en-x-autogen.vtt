00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.800
if

2
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.100
if you

3
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.200
Well, good morning church. My name is Phil Sally and I'm the

4
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100
new pastor on staff. And so this is kind of

5
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
like a blind date. You don't know me and I don't know

6
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.400
you and we're trying to figure this out and we're gonna hope it goes. Well,

7
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.500
my daughter came to the service.

8
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.200
And so if you don't like this, this is her fault.

9
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.400
She's the one that sent me the link about this job posting. And anyway,

10
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.300
Scott that was like the dating app.

11
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.300
If you will. The reason that I'm here is that

12
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.100
Alan Rice one of

13
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.200
our elders was slated to speak today and I was going to speak next week.

14
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.600
And then yesterday I was playing pickleball until about 10 AM and

15
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
then I go to my car and I have about a dozen messages

16
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
and I'm new so I don't get messages right

17
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.300
now. And the first one said brother John

18
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.600
and brother field. I'm not feeling really good can

19
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.200
feel trade with me.

20
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.600
and I'm like

21
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.200
I've got a date tomorrow anyway, so if

22
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.600
you let's not make this awkward, we're

23
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.400
gonna do it and I've done some preaching before so I want

24
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.700
to introduce myself. I'm the pastor of discipleship and

25
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300
community and I can't think of a more

26
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.500
exciting calling than to be the pastor discipleship and

27
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.300
Community to a church who's vision statement says that

28
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.200
we want to become a hub for an

29
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.100
all ages disciple making movement. I

30
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.400
can't believe that God picked me

31
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.000
to be here and I want to thank Pastor John

32
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.500
and our Elder counselor for letting me preach. I

33
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.800
believe this is a sacred honor preaching is a high responsibility

34
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.400
and a privilege and so I'm excited

35
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.400
about doing this and so we've been locked looking at

36
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.800
Parables and Parables of stories that Jesus told and

37
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.300
they were stories that told about the kingdom of God and

38
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.100
how the kingdom of God is different from the kingdom of the

39
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.300
world. And so you're gonna see worldly values and Kingdom values

40
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.000
and Jesus often would take

41
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.400
And we'll see today how he would take a story

42
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.800
and then he would compare and contrast worldly values

43
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.400
from Kingdom values. But beyond that today,

44
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.100
we're not going to just see this difference, but we're going to

45
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.600
hear Jesus tell a story a very famous story about

46
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.000
the infinite love of God and the extraordinary expectations

47
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.200
that God had for his people. So

48
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.400
you have your Bibles turn to Luke 10 and while you're

49
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.000
turning there, this is a crowd participation moment. I'm going to ask you

50
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.500
a question and you're gonna need to be able to raise your

51
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.100
hand. I want you to keep it up. And as

52
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.400
long as you can until we get

53
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400
to the end here how many of you ever lived in a house

54
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.600
in a neighborhood raise your hand keep it up how many

55
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.400
of you've lived in an apartment or a dormitory or

56
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.000
you've been camping and you've shared Campground

57
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.100
space now in a few

58
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.800
seconds, I'm gonna ask you to drop your hand if you've ever had neighborhood

59
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.500
problems ever had a problem neighbor

60
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500
one of you

61
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.300
No, no, we're not done and keep those

62
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.200
hands up. You are definitely tell there's a Baptist crowd. I say put

63
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.700
your hands up.

64
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.000
So one of your neighbors is overstepped

65
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.300
or underperformed or showed poor Behavior or

66
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.400
the music was too loud or the grass was too long. It had uncontrolled pets or

67
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400
uninhibited actions are offended by you on the count of

68
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.800
three. If you've ever had neighbor problems, then you

69
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.400
can drop your hands one, two three.

70
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.300
Okay, just a couple didn't drop their

71
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.500
hands.

72
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.300
If you've never had neighbor problems, is it possible that you were

73
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.100
the problem neighbor?

74
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.300
I'm sorry, I don't know you but we'll get to know each other

75
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.500
better later. Anyway, that that

76
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.700
joke works every time by the way, let's talk

77
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.700
a little bit about neighbors. One of my favorite experts on neighbors Fred

78
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.400
Rogers. And if you don't know who Mr. Rogers is then you're

79
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.500
too young. And so maybe you've seen Tom Hanks

80
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.600
play Fred Rogers, but he had a show called Mr. Rogers neighborhood

81
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.500
and he started every show with the same song and

82
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.400
it will something like this by the way, John asked

83
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.800
me to where cardigan sweater

84
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.900
and changing my shoes and

85
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.100
He's gone, so I don't have to do that. Anyway, just

86
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.100
kidding. Oh, this is

87
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.300
not the one that goes out on live stream. But anyway,

88
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.200
This is the song. It says it's a beautiful

89
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.300
day in the neighborhood a beautiful day. But neighbor the last

90
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.200
three questions. Would you be mine? Could you

91
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.500
be mine and all together? We sing won't you be

92
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.300
my neighbor. It's like praise and worship in here,

93
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.600
wasn't it?

94
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.200
Well, that's not as easy

95
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.800
as it sounds it's a good song, but did you

96
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.200
see how many hands went down?

97
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.500
I mean Jesus told this story a parable

98
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.000
to explain these Kingdom expectations and in

99
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.700
Luke 10:25, a

100
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.100
lawyer asks a question. Now this lawyer is not

101
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.500
like we understand the word lawyer. This is an expert in the Old Testament

102
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.100
law and it's his job to interpret the law.

103
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.500
And so there's this problem and there are several problems in

104
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.600
his questioning of Jesus and we read about it in verse 25

105
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.300
and behold a lawyer stood up to put him

106
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.800
to the test.

107
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.700
Saying teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal

108
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.400
life and he said to him? No, Jesus Jesus

109
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.100
asking the lawyer.

110
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.100
What is written in the law?

111
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.700
And how do you read it?

112
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.200
So we see this lawyer stand up and we know

113
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.600
that this is a Pharisee scribe. He's a Pharisee because the Sadducees

114
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.600
are the Jewish aristocracy. They don't believe in the eternal

115
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.300
life. And so this is a Pharisee whose job

116
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.500
is to interpret the written Old Testament law and

117
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.600
the talmud or the oral Traditions. He's an

118
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600
expert. Okay, and he stands up which means he's probably

119
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.500
at an official teaching of Jesus.

120
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.300
Where you sit at the feet of the teaching rabbi?

121
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.400
What an amazing opportunity to sit at

122
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.400
the feet of the master teacher Jesus and to hear him teach,

123
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.600
but the lawyer doesn't see it like that.

124
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.200
The lawyer put him to the test. Now the

125
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.800
Greek term test implies evil motives. When

126
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.300
used elsewhere in the New Testament. It

127
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.800
means leaning towards destruction. So this lawyer has

128
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.800
an aggressive confrontation planned of

129
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.400
Jesus. He's not interested in asking Jesus about

130
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400
his own spiritual need he's not interested in having

131
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.100
Jesus answer questions that he has in order to become a

132
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.200
better person or more Godly. He's trying to

133
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.100
trap Jesus to discredit Jesus to harm

134
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.400
his

135
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.400
Is just to hurt him.

136
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.900
Right. And so that's number one

137
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.600
point and by the way, if because this

138
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.900
was quick we didn't get the paper notes, but

139
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.300
if you would like to turn in your app to the notes and there's

140
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.300
notes for the you to follow along and so just once you

141
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.400
know, if you know what that means and go ahead and if you don't I'm sorry, there's nothing

142
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.000
and we can do.

143
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.300
So Point number one, is this Jesus?

144
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.100
Is not to be tested.

145
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.500
In fact, I would say Jesus is to be trusted. Do not

146
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.500
test Jesus. This is a pattern repeated throughout

147
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.500
the New Testament people trying to test Jesus and it never

148
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.900
ends will for people who want to challenge Jesus.

149
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.500
You remember that before Jesus ministry. He

150
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.200
was led by the Holy Spirit Into the Wilderness to

151
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.400
be tempted of the devil the tempter. And so the tempter

152
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.600
asked him to change stones into bread and he says it's written man

153
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.600
will not live by bread alone. But the second question was this he takes

154
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.600
him to the holy city to the Pinnacle of the temple and

155
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.300
he says jump off of here and it is written

156
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.400
and it alarms me that the Bible that the devil knows the Bible, but

157
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.400
he he quotes from scripture and he says that the that God

158
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.400
will give the Angels charge concerning you lest your desk your

159
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.300
foot against a stone.

160
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.400
And this is what Jesus says.

161
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.500
he says

162
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.200
Again, it is written you shall not

163
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.300
put the Lord your God to the test.

164
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.800
So testing Jesus means you don't

165
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.600
know Jesus.

166
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.500
You don't understand what he's done for you the sacrifice that

167
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.300
he's made for you. You're not familiar with how passionate and

168
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.400
Healy he loves you and pursues you see

169
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.200
testing. Jesus means you've never experienced the perfect

170
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.400
Heart of Jesus.

171
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.700
How he loves and how he gives and how he serves and how he reflects

172
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.800
God's glory.

173
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.500
And let me ask let me ask you a favor. Okay? I'm

174
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.300
an old school preacher. Okay. I've been preaching a really long time. And

175
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.300
so your ability to say Amen during

176
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.300
the sermon is in complete correlation to my ability to

177
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.900
to stop on time.

178
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.700
Okay. Amen. She's got some place to be. Yeah, she

179
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.200
liked that one. So I'm about to get

180
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.600
I'm gonna describe Jesus for you just very briefly and if

181
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.100
you can concur with me as to who

182
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.300
this Jesus is, then you could say Amen if

183
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.100
you never have this is your opportunity to give it a try, you know,

184
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.400
see how I feel so, okay, Jesus is

185
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.400
Emmanuel that means god with us. He is

186
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.000
friend Living Water bread of life lighter the

187
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.400
world. He is Miracle Worker Lamb of

188
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.500
God King of Kings Lord of lords. He is the returning

189
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.400
ruler and is God who knows and loves

190
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400
you. Amen.

191
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.500
You see if you test Jesus it's because

192
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.600
you don't know Jesus and that's a problem. And this

193
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.500
lawyer doesn't know Jesus and he confirms

194
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.400
his ignorance with this question. He exposes the

195
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.300
second problem. And this is the second truth. There's nothing you

196
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.600
can do to inherit eternal life.

197
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.100
What can you do to inhibitory inherit eternal life

198
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.400
nothing?

199
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.000
He says teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal

200
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.300
life? What shall I do that implies personal action? He thinks there's

201
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.700
something he can do. He wants to know. What is it?

202
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800
See, this is one of the most deeply entrenched human

203
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.600
beliefs that a person must do something to

204
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.300
impress God or to earn his favor. But that

205
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.300
question even contains a contradiction. What does

206
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.400
anyone do to earn an inheritance? Nothing you

207
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.900
just were born in the right family?

208
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.400
Right and inheritance isn't something you earn it

209
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.100
comes as a gift. It's based upon a relationship not

210
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.000
on performance.

211
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.600
So you don't do something to inherit anything?

212
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.400
But this lawyer like most first century

213
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.400
Jews believe that his salvation was based upon his actions

214
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.600
or his ability to obey the Mosaic law, but

215
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.200
listen to me and by the way, if you're new here and

216
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
you've not heard this explained you this

217
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.100
is the gospel. This is the good news This Is

218
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.500
Why We Gather and sing praises to Jesus because what if

219
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.100
he's done for us?

220
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.300
Humanity is evil.

221
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.200
We are sinful Romans 3:23 says for

222
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.200
all of sin and fall short of the glory of God.

223
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.300
You see God's laws are written as a reflection of his character.

224
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.800
That's why it is intensely perfect and impossible

225
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.900
to obey perfectly the purpose

226
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.200
of the law then is to expose our sinfulness. We

227
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.500
cannot be saved by our own action,

228
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.100
but listen to the good news.

229
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.400
Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is

230
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.300
death. That's what we deserve. That's what we've earned. But the

231
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.200
free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ

232
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200
Our Lord. Amen.

233
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.500
For by grace, are you saved through faith that not

234
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.300
of yourselves. It is a gift of God not of

235
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.400
works so that no one can boast. So Jesus

236
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.700
turns the question back on the lawyer.

237
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.500
He turns the tables and he asks the lawyer. What

238
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.300
does the law say? And how do you read it? You see

239
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.100
Jesus because he's a good Rabbi often asks questions. And

240
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.400
he answers this question with a

241
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.200
question. What is written in the in the law? And how do

242
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.300
you read it? And the lawyer answers correctly. He

243
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.500
says you should love the Lord your God with all your heart with all

244
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.100
your soul with all your strength with all

245
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.000
your mind and your neighbor as yourself.

246
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.300
And Jesus said to him you have answered correctly do

247
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.700
this and you will live that

248
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.100
phrase you have answered correctly. What if Jesus

249
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.100
had stopped there? Well, the expert in the law would have

250
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.100
thought himself nailed it and he would have loved for

251
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.400
everybody. No, you know, he got it right. That's excellent. But that's not what

252
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.800
Jesus did he did not stop and the lawyer desperately

253
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.600
needed to hear the very next phrase you

254
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.400
have answered correctly. And then he said something very

255
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:28.900
important.

256
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.800
Do this and you will live.

257
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.400
Notice Jesus doesn't say answer correctly and

258
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.300
you will live he says do this and you will

259
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.100
live you see religious people can get this really mixed up.

260
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.600
Sometimes we think it's the spiritual people are the

261
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.500
people who know all about the Bible are able to give the correct answers.

262
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.200
That's what the expert in the law thought.

263
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.200
He did know a lot about the Bible and he did get the correct answer. But this

264
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.700
is what Jesus doesn't said.

265
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.000
Jesus says

266
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.200
you have answered correctly do this.

267
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.700
So Jesus is saying to God the main thing

268
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.100
is to actually do the loving.

269
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.100
The main thing for you and me

270
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.400
is to actually do this to love God with all

271
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.600
that we have as God defines love and and that's

272
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.000
one thing. I love about Henderson Hills Baptist Church.

273
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.200
And one of the reasons that I believe God called me here is I believe

274
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.400
with all my heart and our mission and vision and one

275
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.600
of our and our mission is equipping one another to love

276
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.600
Jesus and to live scent this Parable is

277
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.200
all about living sin. It's on the road again.

278
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.100
And one of our compelling core values is compelling

279
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.500
love which says we demonstrate the

280
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.400
love of Jesus by respecting the Dignity of every person.

281
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.700
Sacrificing for our neighbors and cultivating Unity

282
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.500
for our faith family.

283
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.000
So Jesus says do this.

284
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.700
And you will live.

285
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.500
Now the expert in the law. I can't just walk away. He's hooked.

286
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.100
It's like he knows Jesus knows I

287
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.800
don't really do this.

288
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.200
But he wants to be justified and he

289
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.400
wants to justify himself.

290
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.400
And that's inside all of us, isn't it? I mean, we all want

291
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.300
to be justified. We all want to look good. We all want to

292
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.400
appear dignified or legitimate. We all want

293
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.200
to be right or to be proven, right? We all want to

294
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.900
be regarded as correct or even Superior. So

295
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.700
the lawyer asks a second revealing question.

296
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.400
And who is my neighbor?

297
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.900
Desiring to justify himself

298
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.500
He asks who is my neighbor? This is

299
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.200
another point. It's not on your notes, but you can't

300
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.500
justify yourself. If you try to justify yourself. It's

301
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.100
a problem, but it's a problem for eternity.

302
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.400
The expert in the law is saying to himself. Hey, I'm

303
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.500
an expert in the law. If anybody deserves

304
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.800
to be justified, it's me.

305
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.500
He's looking for a loophole. Okay, so if I have to

306
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.500
love my neighbor then in fact, who is my neighbor?

307
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.500
Who am I obligated to have to love who is

308
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.300
the category that fits neighbor that makes me

309
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.300
obligated to love? In fact who is eligible to

310
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.700
receive my love? You see the lawyer is insinuating that

311
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.600
there were some who were simply not worthy to

312
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.700
be considered his neighbor.

313
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.200
This is his attempt for self justification.

314
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.200
But what he doesn't know is that Jesus is the lawgiver.

315
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.500
He gave us the law. But Jesus is also the law of

316
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.600
fulfiller who came to fulfill the law.

317
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.500
He is the one who would fulfill the requirements of

318
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.000
the law.

319
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.200
Not the lawyer.

320
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.300
He wants to earn what he gets. He wants to use a balance scale. I'm a

321
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.000
good man. Not a bad guy. I'm a good guy, but see

322
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.300
instead of answering the question who is my

323
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.000
neighbor. Jesus tells a story.

324
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.800
It's a very famous story.

325
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.700
And Jesus is not going to answer the question.

326
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.700
Who is my neighbor? Let's look at verse 30.

327
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.600
Now remember in this story you're going to see a stark difference

328
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.300
in between worldly values.

329
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.200
And Kingdom values verse 30 Jesus replied A

330
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.200
man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell

331
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.500
among robbers who stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half

332
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:15.700
dead.

333
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.100
So what do we know about the man left half dead?

334
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.200
Well, we know he was stripped and beaten we know he was left alone

335
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.700
to die.

336
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.200
Other than that, we have no idea what he was really like

337
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.800
was he a good man or a bad man? Jesus doesn't say was it

338
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.300
an Israelite or a gentile? Jesus doesn't say

339
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.300
See, there's only one potential neighbor in

340
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.700
the story that Jesus tells and Jesus intentionally.

341
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.200
Doesn't say very much about him.

342
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.400
Jesus is not going to answer the question who is

343
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.300
my neighbor instead. Jesus tells a story

344
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.000
of three different people who have the potential to

345
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.800
love their neighbor.

346
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.300
And the first character with a potential to love his neighbors

347
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.200
a Jewish priest.

348
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.500
He is educated in the law. It's the highest Jewish religious

349
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.600
official. This is what Jesus says Now by chance a

350
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.300
priest was going down that road and when he saw him

351
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.200
he passed by on the other side.

352
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.600
Since he was going down, it means that he was traveling away

353
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.600
from Jerusalem. He might have even just visited the

354
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.600
temple in rabbinical law mandates him

355
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.200
as a priest to bury a

356
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.600
corpse, but this man is half dead. See he can recite the

357
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.700
Commandments about neighbors. He could lead the

358
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.600
service the worship religious meeting and

359
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.600
and he he prays he makes sacrifices in

360
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.800
front of people. So he's reminded all the time about

361
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.400
what it means to to show God's

362
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.500
love and to look God's forgiveness and God's mercy you

363
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.800
can expect that love has been formed

364
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.000
in this priest.

365
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.600
Except it. Hasn't

366
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.300
The second character with potential to love their neighbor is a

367
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.700
levite.

368
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.300
Now he's an assistant to the priest. He's educated but

369
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.200
a little less educated and even a little less educated than the

370
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.900
lawyer but the law requires him to show my Mercy

371
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.400
even to strangers and enemies.

372
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.400
Verse 32 so likewise a levite when

373
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.900
he came to the place and saw him.

374
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400
Passed by on the other side.

375
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.900
He too has heard the official teachings about the

376
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.500
The time that we need God's love

377
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.100
and God's forgiveness and God's mercy and the way we should

378
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.600
show it but you can expect too that love has

379
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.300
been formed inside this Levi.

380
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.400
Except it. Hasn't

381
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.100
See the priest and levite failed someone in need that

382
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.200
was right in front of them.

383
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.400
Love and care are most urgently needed by those

384
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.600
who are right in front of us.

385
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.100
We owe care specifically to the

386
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.800
who have an immediate need right here right now.

387
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.300
Would you be my neighbor? Could you

388
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.700
be my neighbor won't you be my neighbor?

389
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.900
The problem with the priests and the levite is that didn't seem to care.

390
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.200
And they might have had lots of excuses to why but the text doesn't

391
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.500
tell us what those excuses were.

392
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.600
So being Pious and religious sometimes can

393
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.200
get in the way.

394
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.800
the third character with the potential to love

395
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.600
The neighbor was a Samaritan. I'm

396
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.300
going to go on and on about this but let's read verses 33 through

397
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.300
34 but a Samaritan as he journeyed came

398
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.100
to where he was and when he saw him he had compassion.

399
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.400
And he went to him and bound up his wounds and pouring on

400
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.400
oil and wine. He set him on his own animal and

401
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.200
brought him to the inn and took care of him.

402
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.300
Then the next day he took out two dinere and he

403
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.300
gave them to The Innkeeper saying take care of him.

404
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.000
Whatever more you spend I will repay you when I come

405
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.300
back.

406
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.000
I am

407
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.100
this stuns the Jewish

408
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.100
audience. They are in 100% absolute shock

409
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.100
listening to a story about a Samaritan

410
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.300
doing the right thing. They don't know the

411
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.300
law. They don't follow the scriptures. In fact,

412
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.900
they're despised half breeds when it comes to the Jewish Elite.

413
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.200
The Samaritans and the Jews for a long time have been

414
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.100
bitter enemies.

415
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.700
Jews would have to travel through Samaria.

416
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.600
And a lot of times the Samaritans would attack the Jews.

417
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.100
And Jesus tells a story about this man on this road being attacked.

418
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.900
And it was a Samaritan who showed compassion.

419
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.200
Jews considered Samaritans to be human filth

420
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.500
and the Samaritans knowing that would do ungodly and

421
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.100
Unholy things just to make the Jews repulsed

422
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.800
by them.

423
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.200
Yet the Samaritan is the pattern.

424
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.300
We saw the problem now the pattern and the

425
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.500
pattern is someone you wouldn't expect is this Jesus

426
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.000
teaching Us in perfect clarity that anyone can

427
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.300
be loved and anyone can

428
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.600
love others the love of God in Jesus Christ

429
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.700
is for any and everyone. Amen.

430
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.700
This is the third truth good examples are defined by

431
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.300
their acts of compassion and mercy.

432
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.000
Yes compassion and mercy makes you a good

433
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.200
example, but a Samaritan when he saw the man he had

434
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.100
compassion. What does that even mean? It means

435
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.300
that when he sees someone right in front of him beating up stripped and

436
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.400
robbed and left for dead. He must do something.

437
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.500
There might have been certain questions go through his mind. Like what was

438
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.300
it like to be beaten and left like this? What is it like to

439
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.700
be stripped and robbed and left for dead. How awful

440
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.300
would it be if that were me? How even worse would it

441
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.400
be if that were someone that I love what's gonna happen to

442
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.900
this man if I just leave him here?

443
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.300
Could I do something? Could I help him?

444
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.800
Could I change this?

445
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.200
Do I have anything else more important in my life than doing

446
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:46.700
this?

447
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.300
And this is absolutely vital.

448
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.400
How did the priest and the levite respond to those questions? Well, they

449
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.000
didn't because they didn't even think about them.

450
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.400
They might have had their own questions.

451
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.000
I wonder if the robbers still might be

452
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.100
around am I in danger?

453
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.500
Why didn't the Romans post a guard here for our own safety?

454
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.800
What are my tax dollars for?

455
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.100
Why doesn't somebody do something?

456
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.300
This is the fourth truth worldly thoughts are

457
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.100
self-motivated and self-centered.

458
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.000
They are self-motivated.

459
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.700
and self-centered

460
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.400
worldly thoughts are all about me myself and I

461
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.100
my own agenda my own Ambitions my own expectations and

462
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.300
if the worldly thoughts that run inside

463
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.600
my head are self-motivated and self-centered about

464
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.600
me myself and I my own selfish agenda.

465
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:38.700
then

466
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.200
It is inevitable that it will be reflected in what I

467
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:43.300
do.

468
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.500
And what I refuse to do.

469
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.300
So we want to step away from the pattern and look at the potential now

470
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.100
and this is the this is the gotcha. Aha moment

471
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.300
that I hope that the holy spirit will lay on your heart today.

472
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.600
Jesus says in verse 36, which of these do you think prove

473
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.400
to be a neighbor to the man who fell among robbers?

474
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.500
the lawyer said

475
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.200
the one who showed him Mercy

476
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.700
and Jesus said you go and do likewise.

477
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.000
See Mercy In this passage is a costly type

478
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.900
of Love Mercy is a compassion that

479
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.800
is willing to pay the price Mercy is

480
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.300
what a judge might do extend to

481
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.800
a criminal or a king might extend to a subject or mostly for

482
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.700
us today Mercy is what God in Christ

483
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.100
extends to Sinners Like Me.

484
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.100
The question is no longer.

485
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.400
Who is eligible to receive my love? It's not.

486
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.500
That's not the question.

487
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.300
the fifth truth

488
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.000
is what? I hope that you'll take away from me if I said nothing else.

489
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.900
This Is It Love is God's

490
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.000
great opportunity

491
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.900
The question is what kind of person is able to offer love?

492
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.600
The lawyer couldn't even bring himself to say the word Samaritan.

493
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.200
He told Jesus.

494
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.300
The one who gave him Mercy yet. Jesus

495
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.200
said you go and do likewise.

496
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.400
Put yourself motivation yourself expectation

497
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.100
yourself.

498
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.600
All yourself put it behind you and love God

499
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.600
purely and perfectly love others

500
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.200
as you love yourself love others as Christ loves

501
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.800
you go and do and you will live which

502
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.200
brings us to our sixth and final truth.

503
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.000
Jesus says this

504
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.100
the whole shocking story just comes back to

505
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.300
this one three word phrase go.

506
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.100
Do this.

507
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.300
Just to make the point of the story clear and

508
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.800
plain. He says go and do and church. That's our

509
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.200
Command to

510
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.100
Go and do likewise go in love.

511
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.200
Now I've not been here very long about a month.

512
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.400
And and I don't know a hundred percent of the

513
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.300
things there is to know about this church, but I do know this about this church.

514
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.300
Henderson Hills does not want to be the church

515
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.900
that just gives the right answers.

516
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.400
We want to love Jesus and lives scent that

517
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.500
means that we are going and we are loving no

518
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.500
matter the risk at Great sacrifice just

519
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.500
like Jesus and only God can do that through us.

520
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.300
We must every day go to God and ask him

521
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.400
God. Would you remind me just how much you love

522
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.300
me so that I will go and love others.

523
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.800
Remember who spoke this parable?

524
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.400
It was Jesus telling a story about mercy and compassion.

525
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.300
It was Jesus who was just about to head for the cross.

526
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.400
Jesus is the ultimate example of

527
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.300
refusing to pass by on the other side.

528
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.300
He chose instead to show compassion and

529
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.300
mercy at Great personal cost.

530
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.300
So we give and we serve and we

531
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.400
help just like Jesus and when we

532
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.400
do we're taking part in God's greatest opportunity.

533
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.800
Listen to what Paul said in second Corinthians 5:20.

534
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.200
Paul who spent most of his adult life in prison

535
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.000
writing letters so that we could read them and study

536
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:20.900
therefore

537
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.300
we are ambassadors for Christ.

538
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.800
An ambassador someone who acts as a representative, so we're Christ's

539
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.900
Representatives.

540
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.900
Certain of this that God is making his appeal

541
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.700
through us.

542
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.700
We implore you on Christ's behalf be reconciled

543
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.600
to God for our sake he

544
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.400
made him who did not know sin become sin

545
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.300
for us. So that in him we might become the

546
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.000
righteousness of God. This is God's greatest opportunity.

547
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.300
Every day at the start of each day. We must

548
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.800
ask ourselves how

549
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.500
I display the righteousness of God today.

550
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.500
If you're a disciple of Jesus, this is your potential.

551
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.700
This is God's greatest opportunity.

552
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.200
Jesus himself said a new command I give

553
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.500
you that you love one another just as I have loved

554
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.700
you. You are also to love one another and by

555
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.700
this will all men know that you're my disciples if

556
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.500
you have love for one another.

557
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.400
I got to tell you is the pastor of discipleship and Community. If

558
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.500
we don't become the most loving thing then I've found as

559
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.100
your leader.

560
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.600
We have got to seize this potential

561
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.600
and God's greatest opportunity.

562
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.900
Look at First John 3.

563
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.400
Now as I say this, I went I want you to remember that Jesus

564
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.300
on the cross refused to pass by.

565
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.200
He saw someone in real need and that was you and

566
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.100
that was me and he showed compassion and

567
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.600
mercy see Jesus Crown was a crown of thorns and

568
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.200
his robe was bloodstained. And this is

569
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.300
what John said about him by this we know love.

570
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.200
That he laid down his life for us and we ought

571
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.600
to lay down our lives for the brothers.

572
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.600
But if anyone has the world's goods

573
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.200
and sees a brother in need yet closes his heart against

574
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.400
him.

575
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.600
How does God's love abide in him?

576
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.400
Little children, let us not just love in word

577
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.100
or talk but in deed and in

578
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.200
truth.

579
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.800
George we all have neighbors

580
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.100
And we all have neighbors with the potential to love. We

581
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.000
all have neighbors that live in our neighborhood and

582
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.900
we have to ask.

583
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.700
Would you be mine?

584
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.100
Could you be mine won't you be my neighbor? How will

585
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.500
I display the righteousness of God today?

586
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.500
And you can be creative in this and this isn't

587
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.200
just the easy stuff like helping them with their lawn or helping

588
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.200
with their trash or waving them when they're nice. You know what we

589
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.200
have. You know, I'm just gonna I don't know. Yeah, I don't know where you

590
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.300
live. I haven't seen your car, but just about every car's got windows that

591
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.000
are tinted now.

592
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.400
So you can get in that car. You can drive home.

593
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.600
You don't have to look at anybody. You don't have to wave to

594
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.400
anybody you don't have to smile anybody and you

595
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.300
get on me hit a little button your garage door goes up. You can drive right

596
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.500
in you hit the garage doors like

597
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.900
Didn't have to talk to any neighbors today is a good day. That's

598
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.100
what we do. That's who we are.

599
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.200
How can I display the righteousness?

600
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.000
of God today

601
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.600
Hey, it's 100 degrees roll down your window.

602
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.300
warm smile a sincere greeting a

603
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.600
friendly conversation start a friendship, but that's not what the

604
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.100
that's not what the Samaritan did.

605
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.300
He picked up this broken man, and he put him

606
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:47.600
on his own.

607
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.400
Horse or whatever you had and he took him

608
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.600
and he paid and it was costly. What does our

609
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.500
neighbor need to show God's love and display his

610
00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.600
righteousness today.

611
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.100
We have neighbors.

612
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.400
At school. I hate to tell you students this but

613
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.500
about a month you're going back.

614
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.300
But is God big enough to put you

615
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.500
in school near a first hour neighbor that

616
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.400
needs love from you is God

617
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.300
big enough to put you in a second hour neighbor is God big enough

618
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.400
to put you in a neighborhood of a team or of

619
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.700
a club or of a man. You better believe God's

620
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.300
got a plan and that a plans you that that

621
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.500
plan includes you and that is God's greatest opportunity

622
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.400
for you to be the Samaritan in that person's life.

623
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.800
We have neighbors here right here at church.

624
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.200
I'm new. I just met a

625
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.500
couple back here that they've been here about it eight months. They're there the

626
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.500
old folks in this relationship, right? And so I will

627
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.800
walk through the hallways and I'll just like

628
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.700
I don't know anybody.

629
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.100
But I'm gonna fake it till I make it y'all be like,

630
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.300
hey good. See you. Hey friend. Hey brother, you know and I

631
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.300
need your help to say. Hey my name so and so and then

632
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.100
let's get together and have some lunch have some coffee and a lot of people are

633
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:07.900
doing that because

634
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.500
We have neighbors right here in church.

635
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.700
And what do they need from you? Well, they need a sacrificial gift

636
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.300
not just your money but your time and

637
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.500
your effort and your gentleness a gentle response and

638
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.400
offer to help.

639
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.600
A text a phone call a handwritten note, maybe an

640
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.200
invitation to sit with you or to go to lunch after church or maybe

641
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.300
come along with you to a community group. So I don't really like that

642
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.800
group. Well, I'll go with you to another group until you find one.

643
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.900
So that you're asking a little much.

644
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.800
Faster. I'm going to say well.

645
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.100
I'm not gonna say what I'm gonna say. Okay too new to be making

646
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.800
enemies right now. All right.

647
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.200
You just never know think about this. You just

648
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.600
never know when a neighborhood moment's going to break through.

649
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.300
When Love happens just like Jesus loves you

650
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.200
you have an opportunity to give and to serve and to help like

651
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.600
Jesus. I want to finish up with a story

652
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.500
that that struck me this week. Okay.

653
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.200
When we moved here, some of you may know this. My mom

654
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.200
is 87. She has dementia. She broke her hip and

655
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.500
so we had to put her in an assisted living Memory Care

656
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.500
Facility because she doesn't need full-time care, but she's

657
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.100
there with a bunch of ladies who also have memory problems

658
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.500
and they don't know one another but they sit together

659
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.300
for breakfast lunch and dinner every day.

660
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.100
And so I've made a commitment to go see my mom every day and

661
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.100
sometimes as I just see her but sometimes I go at lunch

662
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.400
time and I have decided because this

663
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.600
is be honest, the priest and

664
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.300
levite in me is not that excited about going to the memory

665
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:43.900
care place.

666
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.300
You know, they're not gonna remember it.

667
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.200
And I'm justifying myself. If you won't even know I

668
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.600
can tell her I was there and she'll believe me. You know, I mean,

669
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.200
I can do all of those things right and inside of me I

670
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.200
justify myself and I've never done that but I've wanted to

671
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.300
But instead I go and I look around and a lot of these ladies don't

672
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.000
have family that comes to see them every day. And so when I sit down

673
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.300
at lunch with them and it makes me emotional to say this because this

674
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.700
is God's greatest opportunity.

675
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.600
I work at remembering their names.

676
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.300
Surely my mom sits right here next to

677
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.500
her is Diane and then there's Rita and there's Barbara

678
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.300
and there's Lila and there's Marianne and for

679
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.200
some reason they put Jean the dude right there, too.

680
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.400
And they all want me to eat. I don't eat

681
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.700
because it costs money to eat there. And so I don't eat but

682
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.900
there are like you want some

683
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.900
Not that hungry nothing at every meal. No, thanks. I

684
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.200
just my mom says well, why are

685
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:44.500
you here?

686
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.000
And I said, I'm just here to entertain the table. Okay, and so

687
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.400
I start, you know, I start doing the thing.

688
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.700
It's the preacher thing. I've been doing it a long time, right? Hey,

689
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.100
how's it going Rita? She says it looks at

690
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.900
me like who you know and you know me, but I work at

691
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.700
one time at least one time per meal

692
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.000
to make everybody at the table smile.

693
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.800
And you know why it's not their gift. It's

694
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.700
my gift.

695
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.300
And now for some reason I don't regret having to

696
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.300
go see my mom because God has given me a purpose there

697
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.500
and that's the purpose.

698
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.200
To be the righteousness of God to a group of little

699
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.300
ladies. It'll never know it.

700
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.000
And he's got that same opportunity for every one of

701
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.300
us.
