00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:03.005
We invite you to continue

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:04.245
to join some worship up through baptism.

3
00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:09.515
Good morning Church. This is Josiah.

4
00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:12.155
He is an eighth grader in the student ministry.

5
00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:15.355
And this past summer at student camp, uh,

6
00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:17.635
under the leadership of Brent Reynolds, Cole Bone

7
00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.955
and Logan Armstrong, Josiah started asking questions about

8
00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:22.995
what it means to be a Christian.

9
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.955
Uh, fast forward to September, on a Wednesday night,

10
00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:29.235
we're having conversations about what that means.

11
00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:30.995
And, uh, every Wednesday night

12
00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:32.315
for about a month, we keep talking.

13
00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.235
And then in October, during our night of worship,

14
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.435
after that, he, uh, gave his life to Christ.

15
00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:42.195
Uh, he, yeah. Praise God. Yeah.

16
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.795
Yes, Josiah, uh, the Lord has been drawing Josiah closer

17
00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.795
to him, uh, over the past few months.

18
00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:53.355
And, uh, he is ready to, uh, sit before you

19
00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:55.515
and make this profession of faith.

20
00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.875
So Josiah, based on our conversations

21
00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.115
and what the Lord has been doing, it is my privilege

22
00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:03.275
to baptize you In name of the Father, son, and Holy Spirit.

23
00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:12.115
Yeah. Let's, uh, let's pray for Josiah.

24
00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:18.275
God, thank you for just this church family who, uh,

25
00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:22.435
rallies around and celebrates you working.

26
00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:26.115
Lord, thank you for the work that you have done

27
00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:28.795
and will continue to do in Josiah's life.

28
00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:34.555
Lord, I pray that we would be encouraged by

29
00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:39.035
who you are and God, how you save broken,

30
00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.595
lost, confused, hurting people.

31
00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:46.475
Lord, would you, uh, not only work in his life,

32
00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:49.435
but in all of our lives, would you continue to make us

33
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.035
more like Jesus today?

34
00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:56.275
In your name we pray, amen. Amen. Church, we are sent.
