00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
Good evening.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.900
You guys make me do this every Wednesday.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.200
And I am I'm going to for you for you for

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.500
that, but we're going to try one more time. Really good evening.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.300
Thank you. Welcome to our

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.200
role in a culture war and we're

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.600
going to be looking a little bit tonight at climate change and what's

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.200
our role in it? And before we do that I

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.200
would like for us to start with prayer. Can we pray together? Let's pray father.

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.900
We thank you so much for

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.700
You're gorgeous glorious.

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.400
Creation and Lord, it speaks of your glory

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.700
it speaks of your majesty and your creativity.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.500
And so Lord. We want to be where

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.100
we belong in our understanding of what our role is.

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.800
And so give us Insight. We pray for the Holy Spirit to to

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300
give us power and understanding as

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.400
we consider. What is our role and it's

19
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.700
in Jesus name we pray. Amen.

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.400
We're gonna look at four different things as it pertains

21
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.200
to climate change and let me

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
just make a disclaimer. My doctorate is in

23
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.100
missions and evangelism from the Seminary. So if

24
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.700
you want to talk about missions in evangelism, you'll be

25
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.300
talking to an expert at no time.

26
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.500
Well, here's a true story about statistics.

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.600
My master's degree is a master's degree in Christian Counseling

28
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.100
from Denver Seminary and I scheduled

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.500
statistics which is the closest thing

30
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.300
to science the very last class.

31
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.700
So that perhaps the diplomas would

32
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.100
already be printed before I took statistics just

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.500
in case.

34
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.900
Statistics took me out of the honors category. So so

35
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.700
there's what you have as far as an expert scientist

36
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.500
tonight, but we what we will do with great.

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.500
With great effort as look

38
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.000
at the biblical response. We're also going to

39
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
look at political polarization and how it affects

40
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.200
us and then we're going to can conclude with

41
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.300
kind of an exchatological view of the climate change

42
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.300
issue. And so the first the only word

43
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.300
I really want you to remember as it pertains to the biblical response is

44
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.200
stewardship. You'll see behind me

45
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.600
the definition of stewardship. It's the responsibility that

46
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.400
we have in maintaining and using wisely

47
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.300
the gifts that God has

48
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.500
given us.

49
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.400
So everything we have everything we

50
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.100
experience everywhere we go, no matter what climate, it's

51
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.300
God's he created it and

52
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.100
so it is our role to Steward or to

53
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.000
manage or to administrate what God has given us God owns

54
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.000
it all and we manage his gifts. And

55
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.400
so what we'll do first is we'll turn

56
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.700
to Genesis 1 now Genesis 1

57
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700
anytime somebody asks you to turn there understand that

58
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.100
you're looking at a foundational profoundly important

59
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.200
piece of the entire story. You

60
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.300
cannot understand creation specifically,

61
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.200
but but you can't understand Humanity. You

62
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.600
can't understand creation order the role of masculinity femininity

63
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.400
the role of family, you can

64
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.900
understand anything without starting in Genesis. And

65
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.300
so let's just go

66
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.400
ahead and we'll I feel like Dr. Emerson. Remember

67
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.200
he says let's just start with Genesis one one.

68
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.200
All right, so you can look there in Genesis

69
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.900
1:1.

70
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.300
Created the heavens and the Earth.

71
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.500
And then he created light and separated it from Darkness.

72
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.300
He said let there be an expanse in

73
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.600
the midst of the water. So he created land he created water.

74
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.600
Then let the waters be full of fish and then Dryland

75
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.200
appeared and Sprout vegetation yielding

76
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.500
seeds fruits bearing fruit. See God

77
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.900
has been intimately involved in every aspect of creation and

78
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.600
the the creatures

79
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.500
of the sea the birds of the air the beasts the

80
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.200
field and then then verse 26 is where we're

81
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.600
going to get started.

82
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.400
Okay. God says let us make man in our

83
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.600
image and in our likeness the first issue

84
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.000
as it pertains to climate change

85
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.100
is that we need to understand

86
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.000
that we are a part of God's creation that it

87
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.300
is not us against creation it

88
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.000
is and and there is

89
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.000
where the narrative is heading is that what humanity

90
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.300
is doing is destroying creation. And so

91
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.000
we need to limit Humanity in order to save creation and

92
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.700
the dichotomy that that

93
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.900
you are being encouraged to believe is that we are we're hurting

94
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.400
creation. But what

95
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.700
we see from the very beginning harming creation that we that we

96
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.400
are going to undo what God has done because of

97
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.200
our involvement in humanity and what

98
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.500
you see here from the very beginning the foundational issue is that

99
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.100
we are part of God's creation as a matter

100
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.300
of fact, we're the crown crowning Glory of God's creation.

101
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.200
We're the master piece of God's creation when it says

102
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.400
let

103
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.300
Make man an hour image and after our likeness he

104
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.200
didn't do this for the fish. He didn't do this for

105
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.200
the birds didn't do this for the mammals didn't do this for the

106
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.400
vegetation. We're created in the likeness of

107
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.300
God and and let them have dominion over

108
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.200
the fish and the Sea and over the birds and the heavens and over the

109
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200
livestock and over all the Earth over every creeping thing that

110
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.300
creeps on the earth verse 27

111
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.100
You can see it behind me. So God created man in his

112
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.100
own image in the image of God. He created him male and

113
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.400
female he created them. And so

114
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.600
there you see creation order that from the very beginning God

115
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.100
had a plan and what is part of God's plan verse 28

116
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.800
and God blessed them and said to them be

117
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.900
fruitful and multiply fill the

118
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.100
Earth and subdue it and have dominion over

119
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.300
the fish of the sea and over the birds, they heavens and over every living

120
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.500
thing that moves on the earth. And so you see from

121
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.400
the very beginning you don't get it earlier than Genesis one

122
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.600
one that God had a plan and his

123
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.900
plan was to include us in his creation the Masterpiece

124
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.400
the crown Glory of his creation so

125
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.500
that we could Steward it.

126
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.100
so that we could be intimately involved

127
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.300
in it, and we're going to see some some examples

128
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.500
of that tonight verse 15 of

129
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.000
chapter 2

130
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.400
So you're going to see another role that

131
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.500
God has given us here is stewards of his creation the Lord

132
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.500
God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden.

133
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.600
To work it and to keep it.

134
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.700
So not only what are we a part of God's creation

135
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.400
and not only are we given the Mandate of

136
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.400
God to fill the Earth and subdue it

137
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.900
and to exercise Authority and dominion over it. We're put

138
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.600
in the garden to keep it. And by the way, I'm not

139
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.500
going to have you raise your hands.

140
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.200
How many of you didn't like your job today? Okay, sometimes

141
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.300
when you have a day where you don't like your job you're

142
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.400
thinking.

143
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.300
It's the curse.

144
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.000
You know God and because of sin we have to work. Well actually,

145
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.600
this is much before sin. This is this

146
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.200
is God saying work is a

147
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200
way to worship me the way you

148
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.700
work.

149
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.600
The way you respond to the circumstances that

150
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.600
come at you and work as an opportunity to worship

151
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.400
me. And so let's just

152
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.400
talk a little bit about the the blessings of God's glorious

153
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.000
creation by rays

154
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.000
of hands. How many of you and I'm gonna give

155
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.400
you an example. I've done this before and then I teach someone for

156
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.200
not raising their hand or something, but I'm not gonna do that tonight.

157
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.100
This is just about by raise a van how many of

158
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.700
us have been blessed by experiencing God's

159
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.300
glory in creation once in their life raise your

160
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.500
hand. Okay. Now look around that's that's unanimous. That's unanimous. And

161
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.700
here's the here's a

162
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.500
few examples and I haven't thought of them all how

163
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.500
many of you have since God's glory in

164
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.000
a sunrise.

165
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.000
in a sunset

166
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.900
By seeing the stars are the cosmos Cosmos

167
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.300
is a fancy way of saying there's there's absolute evidence

168
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.400
that God's handiwork is on display

169
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.400
in the cosmos. How many of you seen God's

170
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.000
glory in a thunderstorm. I know that's nervous to say

171
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.000
that in springtime, right? I couldn't see it because I was in the

172
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.400
Freddy hole, right? But how many of you seen God's

173
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.700
glory in the mountains one of my favorite stories.

174
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.200
It happened to me when we lived in

175
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.300
Denver for almost 10 years and we lived in Golden right up

176
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.300
next to the Apex trail. That was the first

177
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.200
Trail over the Rocky Mountain and divide and

178
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.900
it's the trail that the Pony Express used to

179
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.400
get over the Continental Divide.

180
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.800
And so I could walk to it from my front yard. And

181
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.300
this day was miserable. It was cold. It's

182
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.800
about 45 degrees. It was wasn't completely

183
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.400
raining. It was kind of spitting and missing and and

184
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.700
I was just thinking, you know, I'm getting fat.

185
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.200
My wife is a good cook. I've got a good do this and

186
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.800
so I was running up the Apex trail and I

187
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.200
was most of the way I had

188
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.200
just another, you know, maybe a quarter of a mile before

189
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.500
I got to the top and then I was going to come down and gravity is a

190
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:21.900
real friend.

191
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.800
And so but but something began

192
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.300
to happen and it started to get brighter, it

193
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.800
was dark and Misty and and raining a

194
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.100
little bit and spitting and and I started to get

195
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.900
why and I'm thinking for myself for a minute.

196
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.700
I might be passing out.

197
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.800
I might be I felt like it right running

198
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.300
up the Apex Trail. I think I'm gonna pass out but it's instead of

199
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.400
getting darker. It's getting brighter. And what happened was as

200
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.900
there was real low hanging clouds and under

201
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.300
those clouds. It was dark and rainy and I was coming

202
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.500
up out of those clouds and I was able to come through the clouds

203
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.800
and I was able to see the glory of God in

204
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.100
the Brilliance of his Sunshine as it landed

205
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.400
on top of the the clouds and

206
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.700
what I just had what I knew is nobody in

207
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.400
Denver knew this.

208
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.200
I was like this is this is my gift from God today. This

209
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.700
is incredible and I said out. I'm

210
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.200
a Baptist. Okay, and I've been a Baptist for a very long time. So

211
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.100
I don't say things like this out loud very often, but I was like,

212
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.300
thank you God.

213
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.000
So how many?

214
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:27.900
and by the way

215
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.400
in the fall

216
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.000
Some of you are Deer Hunter and

217
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.800
I have no problem with that. Some

218
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.400
of you have been deer hunters

219
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.900
with the front of your sedan lately. And so we have to call that population just

220
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.200
to make Edmond safe. But but what I will

221
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.900
hear Dear Hunter say all the time is all pastor.

222
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.800
The forest is My Sanctuary, which means

223
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.600
I'm not coming to church on Sundays what that means right? So

224
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.300
so let's do this

225
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.700
for a minute. You've seen the ones that I have listed the cosmos

226
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.300
sunrise sunset of thunderstorm the mountains to see

227
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.500
and infant.

228
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.300
A gentle breeze a delicious meal a

229
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.200
powerful animal. What am I leaving off? The

230
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.700
list? That is a perfect explanation of God's glory

231
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.700
in creation. Is there anything that I missed? Say it

232
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.000
out loud?

233
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.100
rainbow bam

234
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.200
Say what?

235
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.200
Seahorses, I used

236
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.800
to be able to get those in the back of the comic book. Well, that's no that's

237
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.200
what sea monkeys weren't they anyway.

238
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.600
Keep coming. Keep them coming.

239
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.200
Roses full moon think about

240
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.300
this I used to do this. I taught some kids about God's

241
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.600
creation and I said think about berries God

242
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.800
didn't just make a berry. He made red berries

243
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.500
and strawberries and boysenberries and blackberries and

244
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.400
blueberries. And I said, that's the way we that's the

245
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.200
way God loves us is look at what he said and it's

246
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.700
just in berries. We're not even talking about pie and

247
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.100
cobbler and toppings and you know,

248
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.500
what else? What am I missing? What's not on my list?

249
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.900
Flowers say it again.

250
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.300
Blooming flowers were hey, we're getting there, aren't we?

251
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.100
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:13.500
Say it again.

253
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.100
ant

254
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.800
okay. Yeah, the the Proverbs are

255
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.300
full of the explanation of the ant and its strength

256
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.100
and why don't we work like the ant consider thou sluggered the way of

257
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.200
the ant I remember giving that to my son was a teenager. But anyway,

258
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.100
that's besides one.

259
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.700
Well, listen God's glorious creation.

260
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.400
And this this is something you might want to ride in your notes. Maybe even

261
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.700
the margin of your Bible in Genesis 1 God's glorious

262
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.600
creation, although wearing out

263
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.000
due to the fall.

264
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.900
Is still intended to bless us.

265
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.700
God's glory in creation

266
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.000
Although is wearing out due to the fall is still intended

267
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.300
to bless us. Let's look now at the

268
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.800
fall and the emergence of sin and its effect

269
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.900
on God's creation. This is Genesis 3:17. So

270
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.100
and to Adam he said because you've listened to the voice of your wife.

271
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.100
We're taking that one out of context fellas. I'm gonna rest there

272
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.600
feel pretty good about it. Okay. All right. The context

273
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.700
is he was standing right there doing nothing is passive as

274
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.300
he's ever been and it was his fault. Okay, but because

275
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.200
he listens to his wife and have eaten of the tree which I

276
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.700
commanded you you shall not eat of it cursed is

277
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.500
the ground because of you.

278
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.100
In pain, you shall eat of it

279
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.000
all the days of your life.

280
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.800
Thorin and thistles it shall bring forth for you.

281
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.400
You shall eat the plants of the field and by

282
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.600
the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you

283
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.200
return to the ground for you were taken out of it for you

284
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.300
are dust and to dust you shall return so

285
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.700
God glorious creation,

286
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.300
it speaks of his magnificence. It speaks

287
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.700
of his Splendor his Brilliance. It's creativity. But

288
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.800
as a result of sin now we see that God's

289
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.900
glorious creation will wear out and

290
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.400
it is in danger in ways that had

291
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.500
never been in danger before sin. But now

292
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.400
what we have is the curse of the ground and

293
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.400
the pain that it causes and that's what makes

294
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.200
work hard. And how many

295
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.700
of you have sprayed pre-emergent on your lawns.

296
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.700
All right, why because the weeds

297
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.000
are coming.

298
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.100
And you have to stay ahead of them. You don't have

299
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.400
you have to sew the grass seed and you have to water the

300
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.200
grass and fertilize the grass. You can't hardly stop the weeds

301
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.600
here. They come right thorns and thistles

302
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.400
are reality, but they're

303
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.600
also metaphorical for the

304
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.600
things in our life that bring us pain.

305
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.800
And the things in our life that make that make life difficult and I

306
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.300
used to I used to laugh.

307
00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.600
This is just how silly you are when you're young. I used

308
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.000
to laugh at certain hymns and nobody knows

309
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.100
the trouble. I've seen nobody knows

310
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.600
but Jesus and there's another one that because he

311
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:09.900
lives.

312
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.300
I Can Face Tomorrow I used to think those are

313
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.400
just so sad and now

314
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.300
I sing them every day, right because you live long enough

315
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.200
you begin to understand the thorns and thistles and the pain that

316
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.700
comes as you live in the curse

317
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.300
and in the Brokenness of the world today and by

318
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.200
the sweat of your face.

319
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.500
But but what I want you to see is that even after

320
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.900
the fall there is this intrinsic.

321
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.300
Fundamental Link in between

322
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.800
Humanity the crown crowning

323
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.500
Glory of God's creation and creation look

324
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.200
at job. Okay job 12.

325
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.500
It's behind me here verse 7

326
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.200
job, you know his story he was

327
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.800
a it was a God-fearing man and probably the

328
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.200
scariest verse and all of the Bible as you've considered

329
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.200
my servant job. And so Satan begins

330
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.400
to test job and he loses everything and then he

331
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.200
gets sick with sores and he's lost his

332
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.600
wife his kids his wealth and his health. And so

333
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.000
now he's got friends coming by saying, you know,

334
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.300
I think it's some sort of unconfessed sin in your

335
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.300
life. And so they're coming up with reasons why God would allow this to happen

336
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.300
and listen to what job says. No, no.

337
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.200
No, he says ask the Beast and they

338
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.300
will teach you the birds of the heavens and they

339
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.300
will tell you or the bushes of the earth and they will teach

340
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.600
you the fish of the sea will.

341
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.400
There to you who among all these do not

342
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.900
know the hand of the Lord has done this.

343
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.300
In his hand the life of everything of every

344
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.800
living thing and the breath of all mankind.

345
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.500
So God in his sovereignty is in

346
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.200
control and he is included us as stewards of

347
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.000
all that he has done.

348
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.900
Earlier, I was talking about this

349
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.900
verse right here Psalms 24:1 speaking

350
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.500
of worship.

351
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.400
The Earth is the Lord's and the fullest fullness

352
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.100
thereof and the war and the world and those who

353
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.700
dwell therein. See there's this in

354
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.200
An absolutely fundamental link of between

355
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.200
the creation and the crowning Glory of

356
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.400
creation. The Masterpiece creation Humanity Psalms 96:11,

357
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.800
let the heavens be glad and

358
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.700
let the Earth rejoice and let the sea Roar

359
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.800
and all that fills it let the field exalt and

360
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.600
everything in it.

361
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.700
Then shall all the trees in the forests sing

362
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.400
for joy.

363
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.000
So you see the very Heart Of God expressed in

364
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.400
the song Psalms and

365
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.400
poetry of God expressing that even the

366
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.900
rocks will cry out.

367
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.900
There is this link.

368
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.900
And then we get to the New Testament. All right.

369
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.300
So the Paul is

370
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.600
riding to colossi and he's this is a doxology if

371
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.800
you will explaining who is this Jesus? He is

372
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.700
the image of the invisible God the firstborn

373
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.200
of what?

374
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.100
of all creation

375
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.100
for by him all things were created in heaven and on Earth

376
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.700
visible and invisible whether Thrones or dominions

377
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.000
or rulers or authorities.

378
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.400
All things were created through him and for

379
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.700
him.

380
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.500
And he is before all things and in him all

381
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.400
things hold together. So we're beginning

382
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.700
to get a better christology of God's

383
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.400
creation and Christ's involvement in

384
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.100
it. He's holding it together. It was

385
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.000
created through him and it was created for him including

386
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.700
us and our involvement in it. And then

387
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.300
lastly Revelation 4:11.

388
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.200
Worthy OU our Lord and God, by the way, this is the

389
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.700
epitome of the best example of

390
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.500
worship. You could possibly get these are the 24

391
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.400
Elders who are falling on their face

392
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.900
and now given God's

393
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.000
Divine empowerment are able to express exactly.

394
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.600
Who is this Jesus worthy. Are you

395
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.700
our Lord and God to receive glory and honor and

396
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.700
power for you created all things and

397
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.500
by your will they existed and we're

398
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:24.700
created.

399
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.800
So what are we to do with this?

400
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.700
Where are we to stand on

401
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.600
this vast array of opportunities in

402
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.800
this climate change chaos. All

403
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.300
right. Well, I

404
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.800
I went to John Piper. I I don't use

405
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.300
John Piper as an example very often because I think he's

406
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.300
so lofty when I say it sounds Hollow, right? But

407
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.900
he came up with a great metaphor for how we

408
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.100
treat the gods creation

409
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.600
how we view it and perceive it

410
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.900
and he used the Earth and

411
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.400
he used the paraphraser that not the paraphrase

412
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.500
but the metaphor the image or the symbol symbol of

413
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.400
our bodies.

414
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.000
Our bodies like the Earth.

415
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.700
Are wearing out. All right. And by

416
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.700
the way, if you don't know that if you're too young to know that enjoy that

417
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.600
enjoy that when you

418
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.100
get to a certain age, and I am that age if it falls

419
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.000
on the floor you consider its value because it might just have to stay there.

420
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.200
I might just walk on say somebody else younger than me might want to pick

421
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.900
that up because I'm not doing it right I try

422
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.400
to stay healthy.

423
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.200
And how do you do that? Well, you

424
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.200
have to stay after it. You have to exercise regularly.

425
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.200
As God's stewards we should treat the Earth

426
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.400
as we treat our physical bodies. Our bodies are wearing

427
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.500
out. We should intentionally in stab it establish

428
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.500
healthy habits. Here's a

429
00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.400
few of them. I think you should be intentional about playing and

430
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.200
having fun. My wife lets me

431
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.600
go play Pickleball. She doesn't play and

432
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.600
so when I'm gone I'm away from her, but she thinks she

433
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.700
thinks it's great. Why because she sees how decrepit I'm

434
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.200
becoming anything we can do to get this guy

435
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.900
to play right and then exercise.

436
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.500
I think it's gonna get warmer here

437
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.200
soon. We've been checking the weather to see if we can walk in the

438
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.500
mornings Caroline. I love to walk every morning why we

439
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.300
don't we don't keep our time.

440
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.300
We don't there's not a race that we're planning on

441
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.100
running some of you do good for you.

442
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.300
I'm built for stability and high winds not so

443
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.100
much gazelle-like. But but I think

444
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.200
exercising is good. I think weight training, you know,

445
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.700
you think about weight training. How do you lift more weights?

446
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.600
By lifting more weights and if you want to get stronger, you

447
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.500
have to lift harder you have to lift more and so

448
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.000
it's it's a struggle right but it but but

449
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.200
whether you're playing or

450
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.300
exercising or resting or

451
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.000
sleeping, you're working at building strength, you're

452
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.700
stretching. This is the thing I hate the

453
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.700
most is stretching.

454
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.600
My wife laughs at me because I

455
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.500
make noises when I stretch.

456
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.200
It's not fair. She just reaches over and touches her toes.

457
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.800
I reach over it's like mmm. She thinks

458
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.400
hilarious, right? But why are we doing this? Well,

459
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.600
we're working at trying to make our

460
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.000
body work the way God designed it to work.

461
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.100
But as a result of us growing older as a result

462
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.800
of the Fall as a result of our propensity for

463
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.600
not working out for not playing

464
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.800
for not sleeping for not eating. Well things get

465
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.900
hard even more difficult. So we limit

466
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.400
unhealthy Foods. We eat healthy foods.

467
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.200
We worship God by caring for our

468
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.200
bodies and by caring for God's glorious creation.

469
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.000
So this is the metaphor that I

470
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.100
think we can use in our efforts to know. What is

471
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.600
the right thing to do as it pertains to God's

472
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.000
glorious creation. We're going to

473
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.400
talk a minute about political polarization and while that why

474
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.100
that is a threat, but right now I just want us to rest for

475
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.200
a moment in thinking

476
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.700
How do I worship God in my involvement in

477
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.200
creation?

478
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.200
You're going to have an opportunity guys. I'm new to

479
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.700
Edmond. I was from Tulsa both.

480
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.100
My kids went to UCO so Edmund to me

481
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.900
and forgive me for not knowing any better and to

482
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.800
me was I 44 I-35 North

483
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.900
Second Avenue.

484
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.500
when I went home, it was Second Avenue, I-35 South

485
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.600
I-44 so I thought to myself

486
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.900
Edmonds not that pretty

487
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.400
but since then we moved to Edmond and

488
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.600
we looked at the city and we bought a home and now I

489
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.500
drive down sorghum Mill

490
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.500
and it is glorious. We got here in

491
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.600
June. It was a the peak of the summer green and and

492
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.400
we had a long green summer and

493
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.700
then the trees just turned glorious and for

494
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.100
several weeks. I'd like to say months, but

495
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.400
I think it was probably just weeks we had all different kinds of

496
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.300
fall colors and Carolyn we're just saying this place is

497
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.200
gorgeous.

498
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.000
Now it went dormant.

499
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.200
Yeah, and so for a several weeks, I've

500
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.500
been looking at dead grass and dead trees. But guess

501
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.400
what if you look down where the Tulips are

502
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.400
and where the daffodils are they're about two inches out and it's always

503
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.700
a sign saying yes, but Easter's coming right and

504
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.200
before long some of you're gonna be saying yeah, I'm

505
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.200
gonna have hey favor and I got to have my Claritin sure that's

506
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.600
true, but it's going to be glorious again. And and

507
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.700
that's by Design. That's God's gift

508
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.300
to us. And so how do we take care

509
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.300
of it? So I'm going to tell you something to the young people in

510
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.000
the crowd, okay?

511
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.400
You're not going to believe this but people used to

512
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.800
just throw their trash out their window.

513
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.400
They didn't in an effort to try to keep their car clean. They would just throw their trash

514
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.500
out the window. Let's do this. Okay, because

515
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.700
no one does this now.

516
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.400
Right if you do shame on you, but how many

517
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.700
of you remember when you were a child see in

518
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.000
your parents just throw things out the window to keep the car clean. See

519
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.000
look. This wasn't that long ago, right?

520
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.300
We're doing so much better. Right? But

521
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.300
anyway, I think there are

522
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.600
things that we can do to take care of God as

523
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.100
stewards to take care of God's glorious creation

524
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.600
and in doing so we are in entering

525
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.100
into intentionally that Divine Link in between

526
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.000
being between God's creation and

527
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.800
God's Crown Glory of creation his Masterpiece

528
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.400
that being Humanity. Okay, we're not separate from

529
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.400
creation. We're a part of creation and and we

530
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.700
worship God by by being

531
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.200
involved in sustaining God's beautiful creation.

532
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.600
amen

533
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.200
Okay, now we'll talk about the fun stuff.

534
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.500
Okay, we're gonna talk about a political polarization. Okay,

535
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.900
the nature of American politics

536
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.700
these days is to divide and

537
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.000
polarize to divide and polarize

538
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.500
I remember growing

539
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.600
up there were three channels and there were three news stations and

540
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.400
they they had news

541
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.400
programs at five and 10 pm.

542
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.900
Okay, and like Dana

543
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.100
Carvey used to say in Saturday Night Live that's the way it was

544
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.700
and we liked it right, but but now

545
00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.200
we have lots of news channels and in

546
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.400
order to try to gain an audience

547
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.700
They have learned to appeal to a certain

548
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.800
political polarized position

549
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.300
whether that's on the right or the left

550
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.200
and not to teach not to to share

551
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.400
news but to tease with news so that

552
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.300
you'll watch the commercial and come back and hear what the

553
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.200
story is about. And so it's it's very little news. But as a

554
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.100
result, then we have this wide variety of extremes and

555
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.100
it's not just about us climate change.

556
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.200
It's about all the issues that we've talked about

557
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.900
religious freedom lgbtq issues

558
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.500
race relations as well as climate

559
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.500
change and so it is wise to

560
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.300
avoid the extremes and I've listed these

561
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.800
extremes for you. Okay, you will hear

562
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.800
politically polarized charges from

563
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.700
left-leaning political

564
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.200
figures that Doom is coming.

565
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.200
In fact, it's probably too late.

566
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.000
And they'll even give you dates within 20 years.

567
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.200
And unless we you know vote for me or vote for my party.

568
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.500
We're in trouble. Okay, so some would

569
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.200
say that we're it's you know, it's too late that

570
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.700
we've we've we've extinguished Humanity as

571
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.400
we know it right just to the right of that as

572
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.400
they will believe it's it's too late. There's nothing

573
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.500
we can do and we have to do everything we can just to

574
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.000
preserve life for a few more decades. Okay, and now

575
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.500
just to the right of that we see

576
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.800
a human solution and we can fix this.

577
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.300
All right, we can fix this if we do the right

578
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.500
things and then they've got a list of things that they

579
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.100
think we should do in order to fix this and then

580
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:35.000
to the right of that is a we

581
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.200
deny human solution. There's

582
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.800
nothing that we can do it's going

583
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.300
to do what it's going to do. It's always done what it's always done

584
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.300
and there's nothing we can do to fix it. There's nothing we can do to change

585
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.200
it. We're definitely we can do to help there's nothing we can do to hurt

586
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.700
it is what it is. It always has been that way. All right, and that

587
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.700
same crowd will deny human causation.

588
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.800
Saying that there's nothing that Humanity

589
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.600
does that changes the course of nature.

590
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.300
We know that on a micro level that's

591
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:04.800
not true.

592
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.800
That without certain parameters that

593
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.500
we will in fact pollute the

594
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.600
environment so we have certain governing laws

595
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.100
along the

596
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.200
way like right now if they say you throw something out of your

597
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.300
car you get a ticket for it and I think that's the right

598
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:23.600
thing.

599
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.400
So you have to agree that along the

600
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.700
way there are things that we can do that can

601
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.800
improve the the

602
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.900
climate as we know it.

603
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.500
You guys remember aerosol cans?

604
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.300
And now there's still out

605
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.600
there, but they're harder to find and people are would much

606
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.200
and they've gotten better at the pump action stuff. You guys

607
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.700
remember freon?

608
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.200
free animals that

609
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.300
everybody used in their car to keep their car cold and then when

610
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.100
they realize that Freon was real hard on the ozone, so

611
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.100
they've have a new mixture of chemicals that keep your

612
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.100
car cold and so things happen along the way

613
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.200
that I think are not bad things to do but what

614
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.400
I'm saying is is that

615
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.800
Some deny that humans have anything to do with the climate changing.

616
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.600
Okay, some deny

617
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.400
that climate change exists at all.

618
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.900
That this is just another part of a random pattern

619
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.500
in history. Sometimes it gets hotter. Sometimes it

620
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.100
gets cooler. And then lastly some

621
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.700
see climate change is an opportunity to decease control

622
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.200
that the government will take over in order

623
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.500
to try to save the planet. And so what I'm

624
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.200
asking you to do is consider wisdom and work

625
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.800
at trying to avoid the extremes. Where do

626
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.600
we land on this pastor Phil? Well,

627
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.100
It kind of depends where you stand politically and and

628
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.100
I'm not here to tell you where to how to vote.

629
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.700
I'm here to tell you that we are stewards of God's creation and

630
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.300
that there is an intrinsic Link in between his

631
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.500
creation and us and so we're responsible as stewards

632
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.800
for maintaining what God has created. But one

633
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.100
thing that we're learning in a survey of

634
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.000
over 10,000 people Pew research survey has

635
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.200
has learned this and that is the main

636
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:22.800
driver.

637
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.400
Of public opinion about climate change

638
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.800
is is not religion.

639
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.000
it's

640
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.400
your political party

641
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.200
and Republicans are far less likely

642
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.600
than Democrats to believe that human activity is causing

643
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.500
global warming.

644
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.500
Or to consider climate change as a serious problem. That's that's the

645
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.700
way Republicans believe the same

646
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.300
is true for the religious Republicans among

647
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.600
them religious people who identify and lean Republican are

648
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.200
less inclined to be concerned about global warming than the

649
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.500
people of the same religion who identify and lean towards the Democratic party.

650
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.800
It's just it's statistics on a

651
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.100
10,000 person survey, but but

652
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.600
clearly evangelicals have a reputation

653
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.900
for denying the dangers of climate change, for example

654
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.300
34% of evangelicals say climate

655
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.600
change is an extremely or very serious

656
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.900
problem just 34% of evangelicals.

657
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.500
But if you break the evangelicals down

658
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.400
by political party, you see a more polarizing picture

659
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.500
emerging now you're beginning to see why this

660
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.700
has become such a problem because we have Polar Opposites

661
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.400
saying opposite things and agreeing with a

662
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.200
political platform.

663
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.200
Listen to this 78% of

664
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.600
evangelicals who lean towards the Democratic party

665
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.700
say that climate change is an extremely or

666
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.800
various serious problem.

667
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.500
78% whereas 17% of

668
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.300
evangelicals who lean Republicans say climate

669
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.000
change is an extremely are very serious problem. So it's

670
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.300
it's not a religious issue as much as it is

671
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.500
a political issue and it's a political issue because the the

672
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.500
American system works at polarizing you in order

673
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.500
to get you to change your vote and devote your direction and other direction.

674
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.500
So this survey also found that climate change is not

675
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.400
a topic discussed much in religious congregations.

676
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.500
And I don't think that's an accident.

677
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.200
If it is an issue that is polarizing then let's

678
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.100
not talk about it. Right and so

679
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.200
I wanted to put this on here 8% say they've heard a

680
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.200
great deal about climate change and sermons eight percent.

681
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.800
Seventy percent say they hear little or nothing about climate

682
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.200
change turn to the person next to

683
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.400
you say congratulations. You're in a pretty you're in the top 30% of the churches.

684
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.500
All right. All right. So now about

685
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.100
half the Americans want to

686
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.900
take steps to protect the environment.

687
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.500
Like reducing food waste or using fewer

688
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.400
Plastics or driving less or

689
00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.200
eating less meat. I thought this was funny. So I included it

690
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.800
in the slide behind me here to evangelicals scored

691
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.900
lowest on these efforts, especially

692
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.700
eating less meat

693
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.200
so congratulations the potluck pulls through

694
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.700
amen. Alright the casserole. All right. So now

695
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.600
we're going to switch from that Pew research

696
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.200
to LifeWay research and I've skirted

697
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.700
a little bit of controversy by

698
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.800
poking at the pastors LifeWay likes

699
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.400
to interview pastors because a it these

700
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.800
are influence makers

701
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.700
in congregations across the landscape, but

702
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.300
B, we will they'll answer your call and you

703
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.800
do a survey

704
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.100
so they found that 53% of

705
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.400
protestant pastors agree with this statement.

706
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.100
I believe global warming is real and

707
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.500
man-made.

708
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.800
That also includes 34% who say I strongly agree

709
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.900
that global warming is real and man-made.

710
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.600
Okay. So 38%

711
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.500
believe global warming

712
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.200
is real and man disagree. The global

713
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.000
warming is real and man-made and 24% strongly

714
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.200
disagree that global warming is

715
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.500
real and man-made and then 10% and and I I frankly I

716
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.600
may be in the 10%

717
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.000
Okay, I believe in some of

718
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.200
the statistics that I read, but I also know that a lot of the statistics are

719
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.400
politically motivated and therefore polarizing by

720
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:28.900
by.

721
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.300
But by the way, we are in America today,

722
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.400
but 10% say they're not sure whether they

723
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400
believe global warming is real or man-made.

724
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.500
So we're going to show next this LifeWay

725
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.900
research is going to show next that it's it's politically

726
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.300
motivated and not necessarily

727
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.400
religiously motivated. Look at this.

728
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.500
Look at this graph behind me. Do you believe global warming

729
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.200
is real and man-made you can see that in 2008. It

730
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.600
was almost 50/50 split.

731
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.500
the some agreed that it was and some disagreed it was

732
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:04.600
not

733
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.300
But then you can see just over two years that it

734
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.700
began to grow in popularity that it was not real to

735
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.600
the point of 60% disagreed not real.

736
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.900
It's not man-made. It's not even a thing. Whereas 36

737
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.500
believed that it did and then since 2010 we've

738
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.800
seen a complete change in

739
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.600
what pastors believe about global warming

740
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.100
2002 is it was coming down

741
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.400
54 and 43 percent and

742
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.200
then now in 2019, we see 53% of

743
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.100
pastors agreed that global warming is

744
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.700
real and man-made where is only 38% do not

745
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.900
believe that it is real. So there's pastors are

746
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.200
still split on the subject. But even

747
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.700
more telling in this research is

748
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.800
the is the reality of the political divide among

749
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.200
pastors and I'm just going to show you a few of those changes a

750
00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.300
few of these how the the survey emerged

751
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.800
some data that we were not expecting concerning demographics

752
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.600
and and denominational.

753
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.500
Lines, okay, 78% of African-American

754
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.600
pastors are most likely to agree

755
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.100
that global warming is real and man-made 59% of

756
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.600
the youngest pastors. That's pastors

757
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.200
ages 18 through 44 are more

758
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.600
likely to agree in 47% of pastors

759
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.800
that are 65 years of age and older are more

760
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.400
likely to agree.

761
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.400
so you can see there the trend is that it's it's

762
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.900
a politically motivated decision and it's

763
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.200
also an age-related decision

764
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.300
now look at as it pertains

765
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:40.400
to

766
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.500
as it pertains to education a 59% of

767
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.500
pastors with a doctoral degree are more likely to agree. The

768
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.000
global warming is real and man-made whereas 58%

769
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.400
of pastors with a master's degree.

770
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.600
However, 43% of pastors with a bachelor's

771
00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.000
degree are more likely to agree and then only 35% of

772
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.000
pastors with no college degree are likely

773
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.300
to agree that it's real so you can begin to

774
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.800
see that there's a there's a trend and the trend follows political

775
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.000
motivations not necessarily religious motivations. Finally

776
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.900
as it pertains to different denominations 80% of

777
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.300
pastors from Methodist. Churches are more likely to agree

778
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.600
67% of pastors from presbyterian

779
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.200
or reformed churches or more likely to agree that it's

780
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.700
real a man-made 63 from Lutheran churches and

781
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.400
37% of pastors from Baptist. Churches are

782
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.300
a lot more likely to agree.

783
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.200
I'm trying not to say this. Hey, let's hear for

784
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.000
the Baptists. Okay, whereas 32% of

785
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.200
pastors from Pentecostal churches are more likely to

786
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.400
agree. So again, you see that it's not

787
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.300
as it's not as religiously motivated as it

788
00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.500
is politically motivated.

789
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.700
And so what do we do with this data?

790
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.000
You're saying I just came to find out what I should believe.

791
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.500
And what I've told you is that you are inextricably linked

792
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.700
to God's creation that God's creation expresses

793
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.400
God's glory and you get to be a part of it as

794
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.600
God's Steward and that is that's his

795
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.100
plane as as any theology in scripture to

796
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.400
me. All right. So what do we do? Well, we rest

797
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.800
in God's sovereignty.

798
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.300
And in God's future promises, what does that

799
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:19.300
mean?

800
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.900
Well, that means that God is in control.

801
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.700
And we should do the very best we can.

802
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.300
With the statutes and

803
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.700
precepts he has given us.

804
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.400
to obey

805
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:33.900
for his glory

806
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.300
We also understand that there are things that

807
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.600
are outside of our control that are not our job that we

808
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.900
can rest in God's sovereignty that he's going to take care of this. Okay

809
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.300
assalms 102 25 and

810
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:46.600
26.

811
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.300
Of old you laid the foundation of

812
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.300
the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands. They

813
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.000
will perish.

814
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.200
But you will remain they will all wear out like a

815
00:39:59.200 --> 00:39:59.500
garment.

816
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.400
You will change them like a robe and they will pass

817
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:03.600
away.

818
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.400
Though God knows when this you know, just like

819
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.200
our body is going to wear out and is wearing out

820
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.600
even as we speak a minute. We'll have an intermission and I'm

821
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.600
gonna ask you to stand you're going to get up gonna groan like, oh, how

822
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.300
long was that?

823
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.100
All right, but

824
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.700
but the Earth is is wearing out as well as a

825
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.500
result of the Fall.

826
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.100
Okay, but we can we can trust that God is

827
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.900
God is in control because he is Isaiah

828
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.600
51:6 lift up your eyes to the heavens and

829
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.100
look to the Earth beneath for the heaven the

830
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.600
heavens will vanish like smoke and the

831
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.200
Earth will wear out like a garment and they who dwell in

832
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.200
it will die and like manner but my salvation will be

833
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.600
forever. Can I get an amen and my righteousness

834
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.700
will never be dismayed. Amen. God can

835
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.100
be trusted in his sovereignty is secure and

836
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.700
for me to take up arms and

837
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.100
for me to to disfellowship and

838
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.100
for me to worry and anxiety and to call

839
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.700
names and to not be able to sleep and to on and

840
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.300
on the things that we do

841
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.900
that's forgetting that God is Sovereign, isn't it hot?

842
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.300
If I if I if I can't trust God to be

843
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.100
who God says he is and if I

844
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.800
cannot remember the future promises that he has made then

845
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.200
am I not kind of replacing him with

846
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.500
my own set of values.

847
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.100
I think so.

848
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.600
Now we skip to the New Testament.

849
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.200
In fact, I'd like to

850
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.200
I've only listed for you versus 10 through 12, but

851
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.500
let's look at second Peter 3.

852
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.600
Second Peter 3:15 is the verse that I'm going

853
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.500
to ask us to land on for a minute, but but I

854
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:49.900
want us to look.

855
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:51.900
at verse 8

856
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.200
Okay for every Bible is good and turn.

857
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.200
there

858
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.900
this is basically talking about suffering for for righteousness

859
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.800
sake the early church as it

860
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.500
began to turn to God begin to experience

861
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.100
suffering as a result of political pressures the

862
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.800
first 450 years of church history

863
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.400
The Church was against the law.

864
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.800
And you could die as a result. As a matter of fact, the catacombs

865
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.700
are Stacks and stacks of Christian Martyrs who

866
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.000
were died in and buried in Mass Graves.

867
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.400
So it was not an easy time to be a Christian at

868
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.400
all. But listen what Peter says finally Brothers

869
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.100
all of you have Unity of Mind sympathy

870
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.400
brotherly love a tender heart

871
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.200
and a humble mind. This doesn't sound like a fight.

872
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:41.800
does it

873
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.800
This doesn't sound like get ready. Bring it

874
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.200
on. Let's go to war.

875
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:49.800
What does it sound like?

876
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.600
Verse 9 don't repay evil for evil or reviling

877
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.000
for reviling but on the

878
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.400
contrary bless.

879
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.400
For to this you were called the you

880
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.300
may obtain a blessing bless.

881
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.300
For to this you were called to obtain a blessing.

882
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.200
Forever to desires to love life and see good

883
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.300
days. Let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking to

884
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.100
seat. Let him turn away from Evil and do good.

885
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.400
Let him seek peace and pursue it for the eyes of

886
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.300
the Lord or on the righteousness and his ears are open to their prayers,

887
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.300
but the face of the Lord is against those who do

888
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:28.700
evil.

889
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.300
So even though we talk about being in a culture War

890
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.400
this the early church was in a war for

891
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.600
its very existence. It was against the law.

892
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.700
Now now we're in the first Peter 3:13.

893
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.500
Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for

894
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.200
what is good for you? Even if you should suffer for

895
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.100
righteousness sake you will be blessed have no fear

896
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.200
of them nor be troubled but in your hearts, this is

897
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.700
verse 15, and this is a what I

898
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.200
would recommend that you do as it pertains

899
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.200
to

900
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.200
My response for people who disagree with

901
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.700
me. Okay, first Peter, what did I say?

902
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.800
A weird second Peter. We'll be in second Peter in a minute.

903
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.900
first Peter 3:15

904
00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.400
Yes, sir. I got first and second Peter messed up there.

905
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.300
Look at this but in your hearts.

906
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.300
Honor Christ Lord as holy.

907
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.300
Always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who

908
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.300
asks you for the for a reason for the

909
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.100
hope that is in you yet. Do it with gentleness and respect.

910
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.100
so

911
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.500
the word give a

912
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.400
defense or give an answer is in the

913
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.400
Greek is called a polygia. It's where we get our word

914
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.700
apologetics. Okay. It's being

915
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.700
prepared to answer people for

916
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.700
the hope that is in you. Let me

917
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.300
give you a

918
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.600
Kind of a scenario that that you probably familiar

919
00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:05.600
with.

920
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.900
in the current political

921
00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:09.600
culture

922
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.300
people are more willing to repost a cleverly

923
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.500
worded.

924
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.600
retort

925
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.700
than they are to be gentle and respectful and I

926
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.300
think sometimes well, you

927
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.300
heard Brother Bruce Ashford saying

928
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.000
that his his uncle he didn't know how to

929
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.100
use his keyboard because they took the all caps key off right?

930
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.400
I think

931
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.600
we as Christians.

932
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.800
Need to be very very careful when it comes to giving

933
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.700
a defense because defensiveness in

934
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:48.200
our culture. Sometimes me means rising

935
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.100
to the level of offense. Like

936
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.900
if someone comes hard at you with what

937
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.200
they believe about lgbtq or

938
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.600
race relations issues or religious freedom

939
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.000
or climate change if they come hard at you it's easiest

940
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.200
for you to rise up and come back just as hard.

941
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.300
But what have we just read?

942
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:09.500
that

943
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.900
that it's better to suffer for righteousness and doing good

944
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.500
than to win an argument. You might win the

945
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.400
argument lose the battle.

946
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.400
Right that that after the

947
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.200
manner of Christ the hope that we have is not

948
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.400
in.

949
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.500
In fighting our way to the top the hope.

950
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.900
Is that our Our Savior laid down his life.

951
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.000
And took our scars.

952
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.100
And so as a result, then that's that's the hope that we

953
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:39.300
have.

954
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:44.100
In your hearts verse 15 honor Christ

955
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.300
as Lord as holy.

956
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.300
Always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a

957
00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.500
reason for the hope that is in you.

958
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.200
Here's the two. Here's the two questions as we draw too. Close

959
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.400
Okay question number one.

960
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200
Do you have that hope in you?

961
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.100
Do you have a resounding sense of

962
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:05.600
hope?

963
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.200
As our pastors preached through Titus and

964
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.800
and as he's preached through how to

965
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.800
how to behave and how to act and how to be involved

966
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.000
and doing good. When you

967
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.400
do good you begin to experience the reality

968
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.400
of the fact that God has given us this hope and this

969
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.800
hope is spilling out of us.

970
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.400
And do you have that hope is that

971
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.100
hope spilling out and is it not spilling out because you

972
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.600
have forgotten God's sovereignty and

973
00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.100
assumed his role as the one who needs to

974
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.000
change the outcome.

975
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:43.700
Okay.

976
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.600
Now we're going to scoot to Second Peter.

977
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.100
Talking about God's sovereignty and future promises.

978
00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.900
second Peter 3:10

979
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.300
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief.

980
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.700
And then the heavens will pass away with a Roar and the heavenly bodies

981
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.200
will be burned up and dissolved and the

982
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.000
earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed since

983
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.400
all these things are thus to be dissolved what

984
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.400
sort of people ought you live, are you to

985
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.500
live lives of Holiness and godliness?

986
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.700
Waiting for and hastening for the coming of the day of God because

987
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.600
of the heavens which will be set on fire and dissolved and

988
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.500
the Earthly bodies. They will melt as they burn.

989
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.100
Jesus

990
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.300
said in both Matthew 24 and Mark 13

991
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.700
Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will

992
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:40.600
not pass away.

993
00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.100
So and then here's the final promise

994
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.200
of God and and frankly, I

995
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.000
can't tell you exactly how this is going to happen or when this is going to

996
00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.900
happen. But because it's the promise of God, I know that it is going to happen the

997
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.000
Revelation 21:1. I saw a new Heaven and

998
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.700
a new Earth.

999
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.700
For the first Heaven and the first Earth had passed away and the

1000
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.400
sea was no more.

1001
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.500
So God has a plan and that plan is Ultimate Redemption

1002
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.300
and Perfection and and I thought

1003
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.500
about this later. It's not a part of my notes. But remember earlier when

1004
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.800
we talked about the metaphor of the body and the Earth that just

1005
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.300
like the Earth the body is wearing out and just

1006
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.300
like the Earth the body can't do it at once did and

1007
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.300
just like the Earth of the body is sore and ways

1008
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.300
that it's never been sore before just like the Earth.

1009
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.600
One day I'll get a brand new body.

1010
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.200
and

1011
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.200
makes me emotional to talk about this because I've not really told you

1012
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.300
guys about my brother. I lived I grew up in a family of four

1013
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.200
and my older brother was five and a half years older than me. He was the

1014
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.600
epitome of physical Perfection back before

1015
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.500
the days of political correctness. He was voted best looking

1016
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.500
sophomore Junior and Senior year.

1017
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.600
That was my big brother. Okay, and

1018
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.400
here comes the freckled face little brother and I

1019
00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.400
was so thankful that they took that category away. I was

1020
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.100
like, you know, I would have wanted to Paul but that didn't give it out when I was there,

1021
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.300
you know, which is not true. But he he got a yes

1022
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.500
of a scholarship to play football at Missouri Southern University

1023
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.400
was a part of the NIH NAIA division two

1024
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.100
national champions, and I wanted to be just like him.

1025
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.800
But as I started dating my wife she used

1026
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.900
to say to me. Why is Paul always so tired?

1027
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.900
And we didn't know it but that was the beginning of multiple sclerosis.

1028
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.700
And Paul battled multiple the multiple sclerosis for

1029
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.400
about 38 years the last 16 years.

1030
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.600
He lived at home with my mom.

1031
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.500
And had to have full-time care

1032
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.400
as he got to where he could not transfer from the bed to

1033
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.200
the chair and the chair to the restroom and back and forth.

1034
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.600
And so there were times when Paul's old body

1035
00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.000
was just not able to do anything like a

1036
00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.300
body should and that was my big brother the guy that I kind of

1037
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.400
idolized growing up that I want to be just like

1038
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.300
and so when I read about one day that God will give us a new Heaven

1039
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.400
and a new Earth and a new body. I think

1040
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.200
of my brother running the way he used to

1041
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:04.300
run.

1042
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.000
And dancing the way he used to dance and leaping

1043
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.400
and clapping and laughing the way

1044
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.100
he used to leave and clap and laugh and see just like our

1045
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:17.700
bodies one day. We'll be restored because of God's glory.

1046
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.300
because of God's Redemptive power

1047
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.100
Earth will be returned that way too. Think about

1048
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:26.300
it.

1049
00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:30.500
Those glorious trees on sorghum mail.

1050
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.500
Those are the broken sin infected

1051
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.300
trees and one day

1052
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.500
when sin is no more and God is reclaimed

1053
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.500
and redeemed it all they're going to be with the way he designed them

1054
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.300
and won't they be even more glorious? Amen?

1055
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.500
So I want to do next.

1056
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:49.600
is

1057
00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.400
don't leave. I mean you can if you want to it's free

1058
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.600
country y'all but

1059
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.100
We're gonna give you an intermission. It's going to be about a three or four

1060
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.900
minute information. I want you to stand up and turn around and and if

1061
00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.700
you know the person next you really well scratch them

1062
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.500
on the back or something, you know, massage their shoulders.

1063
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.200
Okay, everybody stand up one two, three go. This is

1064
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:10.500
an intermission.

1065
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.600
We're coming back for the final warning.

1066
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.000
Testing one two, all right.

1067
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.600
Don't recommend a pastor John he give

1068
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.100
you an intermission on Sundays.

1069
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.300
He doesn't get to go for an hour and 15 minutes. So what I

1070
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.800
wanted to do since this is our last Wednesday night

1071
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.300
together.

1072
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.300
What next week is spring break and

1073
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.500
then the following week after that? We'll start disciple making

1074
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.500
201 really excited about that. But this is

1075
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.700
the close of our four-week study on Hot Topics

1076
00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.200
in the climate. I mean in the

1077
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.800
culture wars, I wanted to give you guys some hope

1078
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.700
concerning this question. How do Disciples of

1079
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.600
Jesus Christ have a productive conversation with

1080
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.500
people who disagree no matter

1081
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.900
what the topic is, they disagree with you. They don't believe there's

1082
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.700
a new morality sweeping through it's coming

1083
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.900
through with great complexity and great velocity and

1084
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.900
you're going to be on the wrong side of History if you don't agree. So

1085
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.400
how do we have a productive conversation? Well,

1086
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.000
it's the verse we just read

1087
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.500
Set Jesus Christ apart in your heart says Lord

1088
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.100
as holy always being prepared to

1089
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.900
make a defense for the hope that's inside of you, but do it with

1090
00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:44.000
gentleness and respect. I wanted

1091
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.100
to to give you four things to do. First of all,

1092
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.700
leave God's work.

1093
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.000
to God

1094
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:54.200
All right, you guys if this summer

1095
00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.200
Heath will be here Dr. Heath will

1096
00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.600
be here and he's going to preach to Joel and Joel 2:28 through

1097
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.200
32 talks about him an outpouring of the holy

1098
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.700
spirit in the last days and and then

1099
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.200
you can leap forward into the

1100
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.800
New Testament. You can read in Acts to when Peter's addressing

1101
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.200
the crowd after the coming of the Holy Spirit and

1102
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.900
he quotes from Joel about the explaining the

1103
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.200
coming of the Holy Spirit and these people are not

1104
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.300
drunk as you may have suggested but these people are full of

1105
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:28.100
the spirit because the prophet Joel said that there would be in that outpouring of

1106
00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:31.900
the holy spirit in power. So if God promised

1107
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.300
power and gave us the Holy Spirit then why

1108
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.000
would we want to do God's work for him?

1109
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.300
All right. Now we have

1110
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.600
to admit that sometimes we meddle in God's work.

1111
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.000
Whenever I worry.

1112
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.100
I forget that this is God's work.

1113
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:48.400
All right.

1114
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.200
When you're when you're my age and you're you're hired by a church

1115
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.800
to be the pastor of discipleship and community in a

1116
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.600
church, who says they want to become an all ages hub for

1117
00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.300
a disciple making movement. If you're

1118
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.200
not careful, you can set up late at night and wonder how are

1119
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.100
we going to do this?

1120
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.800
And then I remember oh, wait a minute. This is

1121
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.500
God's work.

1122
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.700
And God does what God wants to do. I don't have to worry. I

1123
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.400
don't worry about when Jesus will return. I don't

1124
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.300
have to worry about other things too. I don't have to worry about

1125
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.800
changing people's lives. That's it's God's responsibility

1126
00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:28.100
and through their own obedience and Faith. We're only

1127
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:30.500
responsible for ourselves before God.

1128
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.300
We're not responsible for others. We're not responsible for

1129
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.300
even our own family members and friends. We don't

1130
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:40.100
have to worry about the problems of our health beyond our

1131
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.600
control.

1132
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.000
God's that's God's job.

1133
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.600
We don't have to worry about our finances. We we Steward

1134
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.800
God's gifts.

1135
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.700
But we can pray about those things and we can entrust

1136
00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.500
him with those things. So why don't we just leave God's work

1137
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.100
to God?

1138
00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.400
Okay and been that

1139
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.400
long ago, but I woke up one day and realized that God is God and

1140
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.200
I am not.

1141
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:05.400
How about you?

1142
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.600
And number two you can do

1143
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.900
your part with God's power remember in

1144
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.000
Joel and in Acts God's Mission begins

1145
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.900
with God's power.

1146
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.300
And we don't have to do anything to earn God's power.

1147
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.800
We just receive it because God promised it to us.

1148
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.200
Okay, we discover in the moment that we entrust our

1149
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.200
life to Christ. We first asked for forgiveness of

1150
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.400
our sins. And God gives us the Holy Spirit to come in and

1151
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.500
to take charge of our lives and then God puts his

1152
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.600
holy spirit within us.

1153
00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.400
The rhetorical question that Paul asked is don't you know that you

1154
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.400
are the Temple of the Holy Spirit and spirit of

1155
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.400
God dwells in you.

1156
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.300
Now because I had to study

1157
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.700
this stuff in seminary Holy Spirit

1158
00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:00.200
begins with power and in the Greek that word is dunamis

1159
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.300
and it's where we get our word dynamite and

1160
00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.900
you guys remember Jenny Jimmy Walker.

1161
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.600
Don oh my

1162
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.300
Right. That's the same word and that's

1163
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.900
the and it's it's not a mistake.

1164
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.600
Think about this especially as it pertains to climate

1165
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.400
change. Okay, you don't have to become

1166
00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:23.000
an academically Elite scholar or scientists to

1167
00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:23.900
win an argument.

1168
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.300
Nor do we have to be a great Theologian to

1169
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:31.000
impact the hidden meanings of the revelation. We

1170
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.400
just have to be able to say well this is what God's done

1171
00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.100
in my life.

1172
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.000
And this is how my life is different because of Jesus and no

1173
00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:41.500
one can argue your own personal witness because

1174
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.900
it's your individual experience. It's your

1175
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.900
story and you don't have to share it.

1176
00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.800
If you don't share it, it's not going to be shared.

1177
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.400
So I want to talk a

1178
00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.100
little bit about gentleness and respect. Okay, number three

1179
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.900
reflect Jesus gentleness.

1180
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.300
And his respectful way.

1181
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.100
So when we when we studied about the

1182
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.600
lgbtq agenda I didn't I didn't

1183
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.800
have an opportunity to share with you my experience with my niece. I

1184
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.500
told you about my brother with his multiple sclerosis when my

1185
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.100
niece was probably 10.

1186
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.600
Their marriage began to dissolve because

1187
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.000
of his Ms. He could no longer work.

1188
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:31.400
and

1189
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.300
they had a beautiful home. He was a home builder helped me and Carol

1190
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.700
build our first home and but he couldn't do that anymore. And so the

1191
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.500
church came alongside them and started paying their

1192
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.400
bills because that's what the church does but

1193
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.300
He was also harder to get out of the house, you know harder to

1194
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.300
get dressed on Sunday morning harder to get out of the house. So they're

1195
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.400
attendance begin to wane Wax and Wane

1196
01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.400
and and as their attendance begin to wax and

1197
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.000
Wayne their support began to slow down as often

1198
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.100
happens.

1199
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.300
And so she had to go back to work in order to make money for them

1200
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.100
to make bills me and while she was back to work. She met someone.

1201
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.700
And so as a result of my brother's sickness as

1202
01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.600
a result of they're not being involved in church as a

1203
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.100
result of her.

1204
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.800
Of her dad and having to go live with her grandparents.

1205
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.800
My little niece began to

1206
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.300
experience not just frustration, but

1207
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.100
sexual confusion.

1208
01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.700
And that she was raised playing soccer and

1209
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.700
she had a division one college scholarship to Missouri

1210
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.400
University. And so while she was at Missouri University,

1211
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.100
she was a she was exposed to same sex

1212
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.100
attraction. She followed through with that exposure and

1213
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.000
we begin to see it happening.

1214
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.100
She would bring friends home and she never came out as

1215
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.300
someone who identified herself as

1216
01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.300
a lesbian, but she was living the lesbian lifestyle and on

1217
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.100
the college campus and we had heard rumors and we

1218
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.900
saw it happening.

1219
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.400
And I want to have to tell you a conversation that I

1220
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.400
had with my mother and this is why I'm telling the story, okay?

1221
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.200
So my brother had moved

1222
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.300
in with my parents in June.

1223
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.600
And I yes and then

1224
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.100
July one month later. My dad died of a heart attack.

1225
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.500
Okay. So while that sounds like a sad story

1226
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.100
my mom never had to be alone.

1227
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.400
And now my brother had full-time.

1228
01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.600
Full-time care, so it was a kind of a perfect solution.

1229
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.100
That God had kind of put together for them.

1230
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:40.500
but

1231
01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.800
my my mom came to me and she said Phil.

1232
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.400
Do you think Sarah?

1233
01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.600
Is she didn't even know how to say it.

1234
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.000
you know, do you think Sarah's like

1235
01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.200
like other girls

1236
01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.900
and I said yeah Mom I do.

1237
01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.600
And when my mom gets really serious her voice

1238
01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.600
goes low and she talks like she doesn't

1239
01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.200
talk and she said feel.

1240
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.800
We're just going to love her.

1241
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:17.800
Okay.

1242
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:19.800
We're just going to love her.

1243
01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.200
And you know, I mean, I'm I'm my brother's only

1244
01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.400
brother and I I wanted to defend him because he kind

1245
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.400
of been Dishonored and disrespected by his wife and and I

1246
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.200
wanted to be able to Champion my cause you know, and I was

1247
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.000
a professional speaker. I think I could have probably lamb but lambastian's as

1248
01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.100
good as anybody but you know what we did.

1249
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:38.900
We just loved her.

1250
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.400
And she in The Catcher from the softball team moved off

1251
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.200
to Chicago together when they graduated and we're like, oh

1252
01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:47.400
no.

1253
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.200
What's going to happen?

1254
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.600
And then they broke up.

1255
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.900
and my little niece was

1256
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.300
lonely for the first time in her life.

1257
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.400
And so she was raised in the church, even though she

1258
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.300
hadn't been the last 10 or 15 years. She decided she

1259
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:04.800
was going to go to church.

1260
01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.300
And she she went to a gay friendly

1261
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.000
Church in Chicago and she didn't feel the Holy

1262
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.100
Spirit and she went to a second gay friendly Church in Chicago. She didn't

1263
01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.000
feel the Holy Spirit and on our way home. I just want you to want you

1264
01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:22.200
to see when God is at work doing what God

1265
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:22.800
does best.

1266
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.900
He doesn't need our help.

1267
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.300
And so she could not find a place to attend

1268
01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.300
church where she sensed the presence of the Holy Spirit and so

1269
01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.800
she's a half a mile from her apartment at First

1270
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.200
Baptist Church Downers Grove and she

1271
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.300
stops by to find out what time the service starts.

1272
01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:44.300
And a little Baptist Deacon

1273
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.900
with gray hair and coat and tie is a greeter.

1274
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.400
They stand out the parking lot and he sees my little niece get

1275
01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.600
out. She's got her skin tight leather pants and her spiky hair.

1276
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.300
And and he takes off across the parking

1277
01:04:59.300 --> 01:04:59.400
lot.

1278
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.600
And and she says oh hi. Just

1279
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.700
want to find out what time your services are and he grabs

1280
01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.400
her and he hugs her.

1281
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.400
And she says to me later Phil. That was the first time I'd been touched by

1282
01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.900
anybody in two weeks and I felt home.

1283
01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.300
She said I just want to find out what time the services are and

1284
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.900
because he's a man who can pretend to be deaf.

1285
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.500
He says hurry, we're gonna be late and he grabs

1286
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.100
her by the hand and he starts dragging her towards the

1287
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.500
auditorium and she knows I mean, she was raised in church. She knows

1288
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.300
what time the services she knows. It's going to be there in the middle of the service.

1289
01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.100
He takes her down the middle aisle and sets her right next to

1290
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.700
the pastor's wife during the sermon.

1291
01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.200
He's just dragging her. You know, I can't I

1292
01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.300
can see it in my mind. It was just it had to be a comedy and while

1293
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.600
he's while she is sitting next to the pastor's

1294
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.400
wife. The pastor's wife writes her note says can you eat lunch

1295
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.000
with us today?

1296
01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.500
And she finds herself sitting in the pastors house.

1297
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.600
On the very day. She just stopped by to find out what time the

1298
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.200
services were.

1299
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.700
And she ate lunch with a pastor and his wife the next three Sundays in

1300
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:09.800
a row.

1301
01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.400
And on the third Sunday the Pastor said, so when did you meet Christopher?

1302
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600
And she goes who's Christopher?

1303
01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.200
And so, you know Christopher Yuan was

1304
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.000
a flamboyantly gay man who was gloriously

1305
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.100
saved and then sent to prison

1306
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.700
had HIV and miraculously delivered while

1307
01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.700
in prison he comes to know Christ and he decides

1308
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:38.400
instead of being a flamboyant gay

1309
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.600
man. He's going to be a minister.

1310
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.600
I don't know anybody that will

1311
01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.000
give me an endorsement to go to Wheaton Bible College.

1312
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.700
But he gets in Wheaton Bible College.

1313
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.700
and his mom and dad

1314
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.700
were saved through his testimony and they go to First Baptist

1315
01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.600
Church Downers Grove.

1316
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.800
Somehow when Sarah moved

1317
01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.400
to Chicago she moved a

1318
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.500
block away from maybe the only gay friendly Southern Baptist Church

1319
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.500
in the entire United States of America.

1320
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.500
What a coincidence.

1321
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.300
or not

1322
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.500
maybe we let God do God's work.

1323
01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.300
Maybe we reflect Jesus gentle and respectful way.

1324
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.200
And maybe we just wait for jesus' return let him fix

1325
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.400
this thing. Jesus disciples watch their lord

1326
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.700
enter into the clouds.

1327
01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.600
He had shown up for almost about a month about 25 days.

1328
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.700
And then he has sins into the clouds. And those clouds are

1329
01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.900
symbolic for God's Shekinah Glory. You

1330
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.900
remember in the Old Testament? The clouds always symbolize

1331
01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.200
God's presence and Moses when he

1332
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.200
was with the Israelite people in the desert, they followed

1333
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.700
the pillar of cloud in the Tabernacle. And

1334
01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:59.200
when the temple or when God revealed his

1335
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.500
glory there was this Shekinah Glory of God. Well now Jesus on

1336
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.200
the Mount of transfiguration with his micro group

1337
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.100
Peter James and John and now he's

1338
01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.200
ascending into the clouds and when he

1339
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.500
gets just out of side into the clouds what the

1340
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:14.900
Angels say

1341
01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.200
All right.

1342
01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.000
You've been looking long enough. It's time to get to work.

1343
01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.600
And so sometimes we enjoy the Warm Glow of God's presence.

1344
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.700
And sometimes we were slow to follow God's

1345
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.700
Direction, but here just like these angels reassured

1346
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:34.700
the disciples. Jesus will return

1347
01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:37.400
Church Jesus is coming again.

1348
01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.300
And we can look to the skies. Our job

1349
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:41.900
is to be ready.

1350
01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.400
Our job is to serve him the way he's called us today in

1351
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.100
and day out knowing that even today could be our very last day.

1352
01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.700
So let's make it a great day.

1353
01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.400
Let's watch for him. The way the Holy Spirit

1354
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.300
wants to use us with that Dynamite power.

1355
01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:02.200
Let's watch for God's purposes to unfold around

1356
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.500
us things that only God can do beyond our

1357
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.000
control and then when we're ready whenever it's time.

1358
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.100
He'll come again.

1359
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:10.700
Let's pray.
