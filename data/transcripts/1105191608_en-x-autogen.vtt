00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:06.645
Well, church, what a beautiful day.

2
00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:11.245
Beautiful morning this week

3
00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:12.565
is actually kids camp.

4
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.765
And so if you would in, in your mind this week, think

5
00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:16.965
of praying for that.

6
00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:19.125
There's prayer bracelets out in the

7
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:20.445
lobby to remind you of that.

8
00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.605
But our heart, our hope is that God would change lives

9
00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:27.165
by his love forever.

10
00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:33.445
Just like Hensley's sitting here in front of you

11
00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:38.125
to do the same thing, to declare that faith, to allow her

12
00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.725
salvation to be declared to you.

13
00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:44.285
We pray for more of that this week,

14
00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.005
but over the last few months, she's been talking

15
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.125
to her parents about what it means to be a Christian.

16
00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.525
And so she wants today to declare that through her baptism,

17
00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:54.085
that Jesus is her Lord and Savior.

18
00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.805
Is that right? Amen. All right.

19
00:00:56.935 --> 00:01:00.045
Based on your profession of faith, I get to baptize you.

20
00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:02.125
In the name of the Father, son, and Holy Spirit,

21
00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:09.925
Amen.

22
00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.645
Lemme pray. Lemme pray for you. Lord, I thank you.

23
00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:19.765
I thank you for this life that gives evidence to you

24
00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.885
and that you want to use for the rest of her days

25
00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:25.485
to pursue you and live for you.

26
00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:30.405
We pray for more, pray that children, students, adults,

27
00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:33.285
would see the need to be humbled before you

28
00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.645
and follow you as their Lord and Savior.

29
00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:40.645
Uh, we pray, God, you'd use this week to do that in each

30
00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:42.245
of us you would use today

31
00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:45.965
to propel us forward towards humility in you for your glory.

32
00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:50.005
In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Love you church. We are sent.
