1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.600
All right, if I can have your attention, please we're going

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.200
to start off with the word of prayer and then we'll get

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.000
started. Let's pray.

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.100
Father we thank you for the opportunity.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.300
to belong to something that is going to outlive all of us and

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.800
we thank you Father that you've promised us that

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.400
as we are making disciples that you're there

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.500
with us. And so we thank you for your presence. I pray

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Lord that you would convict us where we need to be convicted encourages

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.600
where we need to be encouraged and teach us

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.200
how to how to make disciples to your glory in Jesus name.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.800
Amen.

13
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.600
So we start tonight with a

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.400
new chapter. This is the halfway point.

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.000
It's a 12-week series tonight's week 6 everybody

16
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
look to the person you're right and say good job.

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.300
You notice that they they were not looking at you were

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200
they but anyway, we're glad that

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.500
you're here and we are starting a

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.800
new kind of a new Direction this chapter

21
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.400
starts the the another chapter on how

22
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.300
to make disciples and tonight. We're going to answer the

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.400
first question. We make disciples like Jesus.

24
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.700
All we're after is the concept

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.300
of spiritual transformation. We're

26
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
interested in more than

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.000
information.

28
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.100
And a lot of Bible studies do a great job at informing but

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.600
we're interested in more than just information.

30
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
We're interested in transformation. You

31
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.700
guys know this better than me. This is our mission statement.

32
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.100
We exist to glorify God. Look at this by becoming

33
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.500
a hub for an all ages

34
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.100
disciple making movement.

35
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.500
In seeing lives transformed in

36
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.700
Edmund. So another thing I won't

37
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.500
spend a lot of time on this but the purpose of

38
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.800
disciple making is not just the transformation of

39
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.400
lives, which of course is the personal

40
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.300
goal. But corporately within

41
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.800
the economy of God as disciple

42
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
makers it is the it's those transformed lives

43
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.700
that go on to bring Fuel and energy

44
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.000
and motivation and Manpower and the

45
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
kingdom Body of Christ to

46
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.700
do what to build a network of neighborhood churches

47
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.200
in the OKC Metro Area you may

48
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.600
or may not know this but our state

49
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.400
convention.

50
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.400
Is looking to churches like us to help

51
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.500
them with the problem of empty churches.

52
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.300
There are six churches right now that are completely empty owned

53
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300
by the Southern Baptist convention because

54
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.500
the church body just they just died on

55
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.900
the vine and they just gave their empty building

56
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.700
to the convention. So can you do something and

57
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.200
the convention knows better than just to send somebody over

58
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.400
there and says, hey do best. She can they want a

59
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.800
church that understands the multiplication process

60
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.900
of disciple making disciples That

61
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.100
Make Disciples. So planting churches

62
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.500
in our nation and the metro area and sending

63
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.600
every day missionaries to Gateway cities among the nation.

64
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.100
So our vision and mission statement align

65
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.900
perfectly with Matthew 28

66
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.800
19 and 20 Jesus taught these

67
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.400
four steps. Number one engage explorers

68
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.500
evangelism is

69
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.600
the first step in

70
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.900
Process and so the word there is go the

71
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.600
the tense of

72
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.600
that verb is is kind of as you

73
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.400
are going so discipleship doesn't start and

74
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.200
doesn't start in the fall and stop before the holidays, you

75
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.800
know, A discipleship is ongoing. It's

76
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.900
go you it's not what you do. It's who

77
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.600
you are. And so as you're

78
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.100
going your normal routine is making disciples.

79
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.400
I know this. Okay. I

80
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.000
know the culture. I know you're busy. I

81
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.300
know if we were to ask you to belong to another

82
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.800
program you'd say I just don't have time. I'm

83
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.400
not asking you to get involved in another

84
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.100
program. I'm asking you to understand that this is

85
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.500
a lifelong commitment to being

86
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.400
involved in disciple making either being

87
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.400
made as people pour into you or taking what God

88
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.300
has given you and pouring into others and so engaging

89
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.800
explorers is the first step.

90
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.500
Connecting Believers is the next step. Go there

91
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.900
go there for Make Disciples of all Nations baptizing them

92
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.800
baptism is the the first

93
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.500
step of obedience and new Believers

94
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.200
are included into this Community of Faith through

95
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.100
baptism. And but then what do we

96
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.900
do? We work to include them into a community group. We know

97
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.800
that we must connect new Believers. You

98
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.200
can read this on your own but in your curriculum, you'll see

99
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.300
that that the church is like

100
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.700
a family

101
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.800
All right, and a brand new baby needs a

102
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.300
mama and daddy. All right, you say no they

103
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.200
just need the mama. Well the mama would disagree mom would say I need

104
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.100
your help Daddy. And so we my

105
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.500
mom my wife and I we used to team up. I

106
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.900
remember one night. It has nothing to do with the curriculum and

107
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.500
I don't even know why I'm telling it our oldest

108
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.300
daughter had a cold of some sort and we

109
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.300
needed to give her some Tylenol and so my job was to

110
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.200
go get the shrins of Tylenol and I put it in there

111
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.200
and you ever seen the doctors how they'll

112
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.800
get the air out of it, you know.

113
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.200
So I'm hurrying because the baby

114
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.300
is sick and the mother is motivated for

115
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.500
the husband to be in there. And so I'm hurrying and

116
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.500
I'm trying to get the the air out of the top of it and I squirt

117
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.300
red Tylenol juice all over the kitchen ceiling. All

118
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.800
right. So anyway, we want

119
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.300
to get them involved in a better family than

120
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.400
ours was right.

121
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.600
But so why because they need care and affection

122
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.900
and attention and protection and so that's

123
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.700
why we get them connected as Believers. All right. So who

124
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.600
would like to I have not done this anybody want

125
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.300
to volunteer to come up here and explain to me the pathway

126
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.500
the discipleship pathway in Henderson

127
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.500
Hills Baptist Church. I'll give you three seconds to decide to

128
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.500
I can't believe you're gonna let me stand up here. So disappointed. Okay. So

129
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.100
what we're gonna do is we're going to

130
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.200
talk about how we're not just satisfied with

131
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.200
people coming to worship on Sundays that we want to get them

132
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.400
connected in community. But Community itself is

133
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.000
helpful. But this is our sweet spot. We're outside

134
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.500
of community relationships are built and

135
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.800
intentional leader creates a relationship with someone

136
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.700
who needs to grow in their faith and together. They

137
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.800
work at growing at what this

138
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.700
is the next piece.

139
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.400
Growing disciples how to train disciple

140
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.200
makers to walk with god. Well, how do you do that?

141
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.000
go there for

142
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.100
and all that

143
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.700
making disciples baptizing them and teaching them

144
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.800
to observe everything. I've commanded you. So

145
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.100
we're what we're

146
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.200
trying to do is disciples. Learn how to engage God's word

147
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.900
on their own.

148
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.400
We had a moment.

149
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.500
in a meeting recently where people were

150
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.900
complaining about

151
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.900
The meal that they were receiving on Sunday.

152
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.700
All right, and I'm not talking about the cafe.

153
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.700
I'm talking about the the teacher

154
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.800
the preacher the person delivering the

155
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.000
word the milk the meat they

156
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.900
were like I don't think I like it. And and I

157
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.600
think I said

158
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.600
You know when I was about three years old I started using

159
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.500
my own fort.

160
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.900
And I didn't need anybody to feed me after that. We'll see that's what

161
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.600
we're working at doing. We're we're working

162
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.500
it at teaching a disciple maker to walk

163
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.300
with God. Frankly. This is my favorite

164
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.500
way to make disciples eventually we

165
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.000
will have

166
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.200
Some curriculum that you can use is 12 six-week curriculum

167
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.200
that you can use you can pick it up at the bookstore. You can

168
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.300
start your new microgroup that way but my favorite way to

169
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.500
do it is for us all to decide. Alright, let's study

170
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.200
a book of the Bible together this week. We're going

171
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.400
to study the we're going to start with the Gospel of John. We're going

172
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.300
to read the first chapter of John every day. We're gonna

173
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.300
make notes in our Bibles about what God

174
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.400
is teaching Us in the first chapter and then when we get together,

175
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.400
we're gonna talk about what God revealed to us in his word.

176
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.000
So it holds us accountable to read

177
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.800
the scripture.

178
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.600
It also holds us accountable to report what God has taught

179
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.500
us so that we don't just respond but we

180
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.100
apply and so you have a built-in to

181
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.400
this this growing discipleship

182
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.500
process and accountability where we're

183
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.100
literally learning what God is teaching

184
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.200
us through his Spirit, but we're also cultivating a personal

185
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.600
relationship through prayer. This is

186
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.000
one of the great things about a micro group is you guys are going to

187
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.500
be able to pray together you're going to be able to report about

188
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.800
things that you probably couldn't report about in your community group

189
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.200
because you're kind of embarrassed about them, you know, I need

190
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.500
you to pray for me because something you wouldn't share in

191
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.000
a public situation. So that's that's

192
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.700
the third thing now remember

193
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.300
We're doing this because we believe that a disciple is one

194
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.500
who is following Jesus one that is being changed by

195
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.200
Jesus. That's a transformation and one that's

196
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200
committed to the mission of Jesus disciple making so that's

197
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.900
that's what we're working at doing is connecting Believers

198
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.600
and growing disciples. The fourth step is

199
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.700
this we want to go multiply and

200
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.600
that means this is an implied in the Great

201
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.100
Commission in Matthew 28 that Jesus implies that

202
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.600
once disciples are connected and growing

203
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.600
spiritually then there to be released

204
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.500
and deployed the multiply their life into others.

205
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.800
I told you about Rusty Watson.

206
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.000
I just met Rusty over an email and we

207
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.300
met at the IHOP and our very

208
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.100
first meeting we're sitting down together. I've got a six-week curriculum

209
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.500
called starting point and I give them

210
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.300
their curriculum. It's very Mechanicals just

211
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.500
like a program, but I said that night. I mean that morning

212
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.200
at the IHOP. I said guys if we're still meeting together

213
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.100
in two years, I'm gonna be very disappointed. They look

214
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.200
at me like why I said because at that point you're supposed

215
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.300
to be running your own group.

216
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.400
and

217
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.600
Then I kind of you know, I would revisit it on occasion and

218
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.700
then I would ask them to teach and I would ask them to lead the prayer before,

219
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.800
you know, I'll know it about a year later Rusty says

220
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.700
Phil can what can I set in the car with you for a minute? This is

221
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.300
not always a good thing when you're a pastor.

222
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.000
When somebody says gonna have a private moment with your pastor, you're about to

223
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.600
hear bad news, right? But what rusty said

224
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.800
is is you remember when we first met you said

225
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.100
one day you would hope that we would lead our own

226
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.300
group.

227
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.200
And I said, I remember that he goes, I think it's time for

228
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.200
me to try that and I said Rusty. I'm so proud of you.

229
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.600
I said I think you can do this and so he was

230
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.100
in a community group at our church. We called him

231
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.800
life groups. It wasn't Life Church. It was Prestonwood Baptist. And anyway,

232
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.300
he started with

233
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.500
some men that he already knew in our community

234
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.400
group who they're good guys. These are

235
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.000
not bad guys. These are just guys who had never had someone

236
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.300
challenging them about growing deeper in their

237
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.300
face with Christ. And so they all agreed to meet and so

238
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.200
they started meeting in a different IHOP just down the street.

239
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.700
And I met later too. They were retired guys. And so

240
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.200
if they started meeting and they started

241
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.600
enjoying one another and then Rusty kind of got frustrated because

242
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.200
they weren't progressing at the same rate. And so

243
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.100
he started going back to his old Bible study. Well guess what happened?

244
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.100
The new group of guys called him and said what's going on?

245
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.900
Where'd you go?

246
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.000
You're our leader.

247
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.400
And you know what? He did he said

248
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.800
Yeah, you're right. I'll be there to I'll be there tomorrow. I'm sorry.

249
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.500
And I'm still in all these text streams. You

250
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.400
know, I'm still I've been gone long enough. I still get all these text messages

251
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.300
and I private texted Rusty and I said Rusty. I'm

252
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.000
so proud of you. You didn't give up on these guys.

253
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.500
You kind of wanted to but he anyway see.

254
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.200
If you look at it, you're beginning to realize right away.

255
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.200
This isn't a program didn't have a start date didn't have a stop

256
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200
date. In fact, we had a leader who wanted to quit.

257
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.000
But a team of guys around him is like not oh quit us.

258
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.400
We love this.

259
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.800
So it's it's a life style. They're growing

260
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.200
and they're multiplying they're expected to see maturity multiplies.

261
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.700
It just does you plant

262
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.700
the seed the seed grows why to bear

263
00:12:59.700 --> 00:12:59.800
fruit?

264
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.300
John 15:8 by this. My father is glorified that

265
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.500
you bear much fruit, and so

266
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.900
prove to be my disciples.

267
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.500
So that is the four-step process

268
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.800
in your Curriculum by Craig Etheridge called investing in

269
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.800
a few and then I want to do this in

270
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.000
the next five to 10 minutes. I want to talk a little

271
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.400
bit about

272
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.300
Mark 8. If you have your Bibles turn to Mark 8, we're not

273
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.400
going to do this because there's no time for it. But I think you know what

274
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.100
I want you to say or through here. Okay. All right.

275
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.800
So in Mark 8 several things happened that caused

276
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.800
Jesus to speak specifically to how important

277
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.800
he thinks this commission to make disciples is

278
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.300
this is the first thing Pharisees came out

279
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.500
to begin to argue with Jesus demanding of him a sign

280
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.200
from Heaven to test him but sighing deeply

281
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.500
in his Spirit. He said why does this generation demand a

282
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.200
sign? I assure you no sign will be

283
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.500
given it so they ask for a sign. It seems

284
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.500
to bother Jesus Oh what kind of a sign

285
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.600
are they wanting? You know, he's already fed thousands twice.

286
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.200
The deaf are hearing the blind or sing.

287
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.100
The lepers are being made clean the demon possessive free and

288
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.300
setting up what's really going on. Well the

289
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.600
Pharisees listen to me the Pharisees are determined to

290
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.500
Define Jesus in their own mind.

291
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.400
They're not willing to see Jesus on

292
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.800
jesus' terms. They're only willing to see Jesus on

293
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.300
their terms. They have a pretty sweet

294
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.800
deal with a Roman government.

295
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.300
Herod's going to let them rule as long as they can

296
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:35.600
maintain.

297
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.500
Authority and control over people like Jesus so Jesus

298
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.500
comes in and he can do signs and now people are all fired

299
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.400
up about it and the Pharisees are losing control. And so

300
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.200
they're going to try to trip Jesus up.

301
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.400
And so they're determined to go their own

302
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.900
way, and they're determined to keep Jesus in his

303
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.100
place.

304
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.500
So later.

305
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.600
In the chapter Jesus left them the Pharisees and

306
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.200
got on board the boat again went to the other side and they'd gotten

307
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.700
to take bread the disciples forgot to bring bread on

308
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.200
the boat. Okay. Now he's fed 4,000. He's

309
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.100
fed 5,000 the disciples getting the boat. They forget the bread.

310
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.100
sounds a lot like the church office sometimes but

311
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.200
he commanded them.

312
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.300
Let me tell you what what if I'd have been Jesus I'd have

313
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.500
said how many of you

314
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.300
to eat

315
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.400
Is eating important to you?

316
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.300
You know, that's that's not what Jesus does. He's like

317
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.400
who forgets bread and that's

318
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.600
what I do not want Jesus does Jesus says this watch out?

319
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.800
And Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and

320
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.200
the yeast of Herod.

321
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.700
Don't you understand don't you comprehend?

322
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.200
Is your heart heartened? Do you

323
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.100
have eyes and Nazi? Do you have ears and not here?

324
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.200
And do you not remember Jesus seems upset about something.

325
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.500
He warns the disciples to Beware of

326
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.400
the yeast of the Pharisees. So what is the yeast of

327
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.500
the Pharisees? It's it's refusing to

328
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.800
see Jesus for whom he is.

329
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.100
It's defining Jesus in your

330
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.400
own terms instead of Define letting Jesus Define himself in

331
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.100
your own life.

332
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.100
You guys know about yeast. It just takes a tiny little

333
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.800
bit and then it starts this fermentation process and it

334
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.600
literally firms or poisons or

335
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.500
infects the entire love so that it all Rises.

336
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.500
And that's what happens. I'm convinced that in

337
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.400
a church. If we're not careful, we can

338
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.200
redefine jesus' Great Commission in ways that

339
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.800
we're really not making disciples, but we're okay with it.

340
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200
And so I think that's why Jesus is so upset that

341
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.500
the Pharisees wanted to set up their own kingdom for their

342
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.200
own benefit continue their relationship with

343
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.700
Rome and not not upset the apple cart.

344
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.600
But Jesus is not going to allow that.

345
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.600
And so Jesus is warning his disciples.

346
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.700
Don't be determined to go your own way. Don't

347
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.100
be poisoned by your own selfishness. Don't

348
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.800
let laziness or confusion or

349
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.700
fear or anything else ferment your

350
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.400
faith in a way that you don't do what I've asked

351
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.300
you to do and then

352
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.400
Something very significant occurs and Mark 8:27.

353
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.200
Jesus went out as with his

354
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.700
disciples do the villages accessory of Philippi Carolina. I've

355
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.300
been there it is a very very religious place,

356
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.600
but it's full of pagan Idols the pan God and

357
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.600
they did human sacrifices there. And so

358
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.200
He asked his disciples in the middle of all of this confusion. Okay,

359
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.300
I would say this could

360
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.800
be like him down in the middle of Las Vegas

361
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.500
at on the Strip. All right,

362
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.800
and he says who do people say that I am and

363
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.200
they answered him some say John the Baptist others say

364
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.200
Elijah one of the prophets, but you he asked

365
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.300
them who do you say that? I am and Peter answered

366
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.500
you are the Messiah. So this

367
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.500
is huge. This is so key

368
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.100
if you by the way Peter gets it, right.

369
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.000
He says you're the Messiah. So knowing Jesus following Jesus

370
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.400
being transformed by Jesus. I mean

371
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.000
committed the mission of Jesus. This is who we're following. He

372
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.200
is the Messiah but in doing

373
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.500
so we need to understand that there's risk involved because

374
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.100
Jesus is not just saying hey got a good idea if you guys

375
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.800
got some extra time.

376
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.500
You know, he's saying No, this is what we commit Our Lives to.

377
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.300
That we're involved in something that that has

378
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.700
Eternal consequences.

379
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.500
Now that you understand that I'm the Messiah. I

380
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.500
want you to see something very very key. And that

381
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.400
is that I will suffer many things and be rejected by

382
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.300
the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed

383
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.300
and Rise after three days. He presents the

384
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.200
gospel to them and then in verse 33, he says

385
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.400
summoning the crowd along with his disciples. He said to them now

386
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.300
listen and this is sorry I couldn't

387
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.200
do this on week, two three or four or five but here we

388
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.400
are about halfway through we have to decide are we gonna believe this

389
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.900
or not?

390
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.600
Are we gonna obey this or not? Are we

391
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.600
gonna see discipleship through our lens as friends

392
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.000
of the Roman government or whatever are we going to redefine it?

393
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.800
But look at what Jesus says, he says if anyone wants

394
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.200
to be my follower.

395
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.300
That's a disciple. He must number one deny

396
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.600
himself.

397
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.600
Number two take up his cross and number

398
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.100
three follow me.

399
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.700
Whoever wants to save his life will lose it. But whoever

400
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.100
loses his life because of me and the gospel will save

401
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.200
it.

402
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.600
Three steps here.

403
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.500
If you want to be effective disciple maker number one deny yourself.

404
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.300
Say no to selfish interests.

405
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.000
Say no to familiar securities.

406
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.300
Why is denying yourself so important because

407
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.300
Jesus is asking us to rearrange our life around

408
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.900
his priorities around his command his goals

409
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.800
and his purposes.

410
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.700
Step. Number one is denying your plan and obeying his

411
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.000
plan. Step. Number two is take up your cross. What

412
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.500
did Jesus do before he hung on the cross? They

413
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.800
gave him the cross to do what?

414
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.200
To carry he has to carry his

415
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.700
own cross through the city. Why is that important?

416
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.300
Because it was a way for the Roman government to

417
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.200
establish publicly who was in charge.

418
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.500
He's carrying his cross because we told him to.

419
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.000
It's a public admission of submission. You

420
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.100
say well, nobody makes Jesus admit. No, Jesus. Did it

421
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.400
himself? Nobody makes Jesus man. He did it himself. He's like I'm

422
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.700
laying down my life.

423
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.500
So when he says take up your cross, this is

424
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.800
an expression of submission.

425
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.500
Jesus is saying to be my disciple to follow me.

426
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.200
It's going to cost you something.

427
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.000
You're going to have to give something up in order to do this.

428
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.200
Then he goes on to explain what are the consequences if you

429
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.800
don't follow me if you don't persistently continually and

430
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.500
daily follow me as disciplemaker. What

431
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.300
are the consequences for refusing? What has it

432
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.300
benefit for a man to gain the whole world and yet loses life.

433
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.600
What can a man give an exchange for his life or whoever is

434
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.600
ashamed of me in my words in this adulterous and

435
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.200
sinful Nation? The son of man will also be

436
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.300
ashamed of him when he comes in glory.

437
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.100
Glory of his father with the Holy Angels

438
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.300
So Jesus is driving home. This point

439
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.200
that to be a disciple maker is costly and

440
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.800
following me is costly it's

441
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.900
not a casual thing. It's reorienting your

442
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.600
life and your priorities and totally

443
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.000
selling out to Jesus and his command to make

444
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.600
disciples.

445
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.800
And I don't know what that means for you.

446
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.000
I really don't I do know this that Henderson

447
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.800
Hills has been a great church for very very long time. And

448
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.000
as a result, then we have a very rich

449
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.200
and robust history of 60 years of

450
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.900
doing certain things a certain way and there's just

451
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.200
no room for anything else.

452
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.500
Sometimes it feels like that.

453
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.500
And so I'm not asking you to quit everything.

454
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.300
I'm just saying what is it going to take? What

455
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.400
is it going to cost you in order to begin a relationship with a

456
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.500
small group of people whose life you can pour into an

457
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.000
invest in so maybe you can see Eternal consequences and

458
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.400
see Jesus reproduced in their lives

459
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.700
and then the lives of others and then the lives of others because then and

460
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.300
only then are we going to become an all ages to stop

461
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.000
making movement where we can fill up empty churches

462
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.700
with people who make disciples who make disciples.
