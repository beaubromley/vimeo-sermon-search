1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.110
Hi, I am Phil Sali, and we're going to be looking at, uh,

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.710
community Group Leader Certification. Tonight we'll be looking at the, uh,

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.990
role of the Bible teacher,

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.070
and we know that Bible teachers are gifted and called of God to instruct

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.510
believers and provide spiritual nourishment for, uh, God's people.

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.230
And so we're going to look at three essential truths.

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.110
The value and responsibility of the Bible teacher is described in scripture

8
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.130
number two,

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.310
the indispensable role of the community group leadership or discussion guide.

10
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.430
And finally, the Bible teacher as disciple maker.

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.670
So let's look at the value and the responsibility of the Bible teacher as

12
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.070
described in scripture. Without question,

13
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.430
the Bible teacher plays a key role in the community group,

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.630
and they're key because they're called to equip the disciples of Jesus Christ.

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.910
Bible teachers shape spiritual growth and spread the gospel of Jesus Christ.

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.710
Bible teachers are aware that they're gonna be held to a higher degree of

17
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.543
accountability.

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.270
James one gives a warning to teachers and tells them that they will be judged

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.990
with a greater strictness. In fact, it says,

20
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.430
not many of you should become teachers, my brothers. So consequently,

21
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.550
we take very seriously the responsibility of guiding others.

22
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.670
We know that there are, if there are any errors or mis misrepresentations,

23
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.750
they can even, uh, even if they're not intentional,

24
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.710
they can significantly impact the spiritual development of the learners.

25
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.190
So our role as Bible educators and influencers demands greater scrutiny.

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.990
So let's look at the scripture passages and as it pertains to our value and our

27
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.910
responsibility. As Bible teachers,

28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.590
Bible teachers understand the indeni undeniable power of God's word.

29
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.110
Hebrews four 12 describes the word as living and active and uses the

30
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.310
metaphor sharper than a two-edged sword.

31
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.350
That means that it can penetrate souls and discern thoughts and convict

32
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.390
hearts. The Bible teachers faithful ex of Jesus,

33
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.550
that's exposition and application of the scriptures,

34
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.550
can assist God to bring about genuine transformation in the lives of believers.

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.310
Number two, Bible teachers embrace the authority and sufficiency of scripture.

36
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.590
Bible teachers know that in two Timothy three 16 and 17,

37
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.590
that the scripture comes from divine origin. In fact,

38
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.590
God breathed given the very life breath of God. And so,

39
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.510
but they hold the authority of the Bible's infallible revelation, the, uh,

40
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.190
ability to confront corruption and guide believers in righteousness and equip

41
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.630
them for every good work.

42
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.750
Bible teachers help believers grasp the power and perfection of scripture.

43
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.710
Number three, Bible teachers discern the undeniable effectiveness of the gospel.

44
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.230
Romans one 16 and 17 declares the gospel's power to save all who

45
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.710
believe the Bible teachers are instrumental in faithfully presenting the gospel

46
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.190
of Jesus. Paul said, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

47
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.990
It's the power of God for salvation, for everyone who believes.

48
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.000
But listen to verse 17, for in it the gospel of Jesus Christ,

49
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.560
a righteousness from God is revealed.

50
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.320
So we're not teaching or equipping saints to be righteous for themselves through

51
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.640
the gospel, we're connecting them to the power of God. Number four,

52
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.680
the Bible teachers recognize how faith comes through hearing the word of Christ.

53
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.720
In Romans 10 17,

54
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.040
we hear about the importance of hearing the word of Christ to cultivate faith.

55
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.600
So we as Bible teachers, serve as conduits for this hearing,

56
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.120
enabling believers to develop and strengthen their faith through the study and

57
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.040
proclamation of the scriptures. Now, number five,

58
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.680
Bible teachers understand the word of God as a spiritual shield and protector.

59
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.040
Psalms 1 19, 9 through 11 emphasizes the role of God's word in guarding against

60
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.100
sin.

61
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.160
And so the Bible teachers model for the believers in their class how to hide

62
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.320
God's word in their hearts,

63
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.120
empowering them to resist temptation and to walk in obedience.

64
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.160
Number six,

65
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.920
Bible teachers appreciates how the word of God shines light on the path of life.

66
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.560
In Psalms one 19 verse 1 0 5, it says,

67
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.960
your word is a lamp into my feet and a light into my path.

68
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.400
So our role as Bible teachers is to eradicate darkness and

69
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.200
educate believers in the scripture as to illuminate and enable them to

70
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.600
navigate life's challenges and make good decisions. Number seven,

71
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.360
the Bible teachers honor the Bible as the source of truth. In John 1717,

72
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.880
we have recorded Jesus' prayer and he declares the absolute

73
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.720
truthfulness of God's word and understands that that truthfulness is

74
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.280
our path to genuine sanctification. So through understanding biblical truth,

75
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.720
Bible teachers can help believers discern God's will and distinguish it from

76
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.440
less truthful perspectives and even outright lies from the deceiver.

77
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.693
Number eight,

78
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.880
Bible teachers take hold of the potential of scripture for producing spiritual

79
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.713
fruit.

80
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.200
One Peter 1 23 compares the word of God to a living and

81
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.400
imperishable seed.

82
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.480
So Bible teachers plant and nurture the seed in the hearts of believers,

83
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.480
which leads to spiritual growth and maturity.

84
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.480
So from a community group member's perspective,

85
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.760
Bible teachers hold immense value because they're equipping them with this

86
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.400
transformative power of God's word,

87
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.960
which leads to an authentic faith in Jesus Christ helps us,

88
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.240
helps them guard against sin and provides guidance in navigating life's

89
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.160
challenges. So with unwavering commitment,

90
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.640
Bible teachers serve as a catalyst for spiritual growth and the spread of the

91
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.473
gospel message.

92
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.600
And they lay a firm foundation for believers to live out their faith with

93
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.240
boldness and victory. Number two,

94
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.200
essential truth is the indispensable role of the community group discussion

95
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.480
guide. Now,

96
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.080
in a rapidly evolving world or devolving world where

97
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.800
spiritual

98
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.760
Values are eroding and spiritual beliefs are constantly challenged,

99
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.400
the role of the Bible teacher has never been more crucial.

100
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.440
We just read nine different scripture passages challenging us to maintain

101
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.880
our, uh, our devotion to teaching God's word correctly.

102
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.200
But Bible teachers have to learn to, uh,

103
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.080
assist and come alongside as gifted and called,

104
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.240
come alongside the Lord who has the power to shape minds and instill values and

105
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.560
inspire profound transformation.

106
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.720
So in order to do this noble task, we, uh,

107
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.000
encourage the use of a sound Bible teaching curriculum or, um,

108
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.400
different kinds of commentaries or resources that will help you in your

109
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.240
discovery of the meaning of the text.

110
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.160
And so the discipleship and community staff is committed to providing a

111
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.600
teaching curriculum for Bible teachers.

112
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.040
It's well designed and Bible teachers can use it to help them navigate

113
00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.040
this vast and intricate, uh, gift that God has given us his holy word.

114
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.270
Uh,

115
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.720
what you'll do when you use a proven curriculum resource is that

116
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.160
you'll know that the Bible knowledge that you're receiving from this resource is

117
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.440
accurate and relevant and applicable to the lives of your community Group

118
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.600
members. Now,

119
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.680
community group discussion guide curriculum is written and edited specifically

120
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.880
for Henderson Hills Baptist Church Community Group teachers. What that means is,

121
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.280
uh, that the passage will coincide with what Pastor John is preaching,

122
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.800
but it's not tied to the sermon.

123
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.000
The curriculum is also written in and edited with our church's mission and

124
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.120
vision and values in mind.

125
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.680
So rather than using a mass produced off the shelf curriculum, our staff,

126
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.080
uh, is gonna provide a curriculum that's designed specifically for our community

127
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.400
group teachers. Consequently,

128
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.120
community group members discussion,

129
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.240
their focus is specifically formed according to the mission and vision and

130
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.600
values of the Henderson Hills Baptist Church.

131
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.320
So with the community group discussion guide, curriculum,

132
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.520
teachers can be confident that the curriculum has been carefully compiled and

133
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.520
written with what we call strict hermeneutical discipline. Well,

134
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.480
hermeneutics is the art and science of precise biblical interpretation.

135
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.400
The primary purpose of hermeneutics is to discover the clearest and plainest

136
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.840
truth and values expre expressed in the passage.

137
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.000
Hermeneutical hermeneutical discipline examines the passages,

138
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.360
authorship estimates the date, takes the, uh,

139
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.280
biblical genre into consideration, and looks at the passage that,

140
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.880
that we're studying for its historical context,

141
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.840
sometimes delves into word studies and also takes in mind the author's

142
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840
readership. Why?

143
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.680
Because we want to know what the original language was intended to be,

144
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.733
uh, told.

145
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.040
And so the curriculum is trustworthy because the writers and the editors are

146
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040
from Henderson Hills,

147
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.720
and they're dedicated to discovering the clearest and plainest meaning of the

148
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.320
passage according to the context of the original audience.

149
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.200
So the primary task isn't hermeneutics, it's called exegesis. Now,

150
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.760
exegesis is a critical explanation of the biblical text.

151
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.400
So the curriculum is written and compiled independent of the sermon sermon,

152
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.600
but through proper ex of Jesus,

153
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.840
we'll provide Herman Hermeneutical insights to the sermon.

154
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.280
So the discussion questions which come alongside the ex of Jesus will assist the

155
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.760
teacher in drawing connections between the biblical principles,

156
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.160
the contemporary challenges, and the context of the class,

157
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.440
which only the teacher would know. So to, uh, wrap it up,

158
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.440
I I'm really a big fan and big proponent of our community group discussion

159
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.800
guides. I want you to know that this curriculum fosters consistency.

160
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.680
I know several of our community groups have a multiple of teachers,

161
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.720
and for them to be able to use the exact same curriculum writing staff in this

162
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.760
exact same voice fosters consistency,

163
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.480
and it helps prevent subjective or false interpretations that could lead to

164
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.560
confusion or even worse misinterpretation of God's divine truth.

165
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.360
So students in our community groups deserve a cohesive and

166
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.440
systematic approach that enables them to comprehend and understand the Bible's

167
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.400
teaching in a trustworthy and sound doctrinal way. Uh,

168
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:22.940
furthermore,

169
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.880
the thoughtful constructed community group discussion guide empowers teachers

170
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.720
to address the diverse needs of their unique community group.

171
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.320
You know your group, and you know how this cu curriculum is gonna be used.

172
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.280
And this curriculum is only a tool and it's used with the, uh, with the, uh,

173
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.320
ability of the teacher to make it its own.

174
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.280
And so by using this community group discussion guide,

175
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.520
teachers also are modeling, modeling integrity and accountability.

176
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.200
So when teachers have access to this well-researched theologically sound

177
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.600
curriculum,

178
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.880
then they can confidently stand behind their teachings knowing that they're

179
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.600
grounded in biblical truth, not just mirror opinions.

180
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.960
So in conclusion, bringing us to the end of our second point,

181
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.120
the importance of the community group discussion guide, uh,

182
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.800
cannot be overstated. It serves as the foundation upon which we, uh,

183
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.240
help impact our class members on a spiritual journey.

184
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.680
It's comprehensive and reliable,

185
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.920
and with it Bible teachers can shape minds and inspire hearts and foster a

186
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.400
deeper understanding of love in God's timeless word.

187
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.160
Which brings me to the final point. And that's the Bible teacher.

188
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.560
As a disciple maker,

189
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.480
becoming a Bible teacher of a community group involves much more than just

190
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.600
teaching the Bible. A disciple maker, uh,

191
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.720
endures resistance and develops people and reproduces themselves so that they

192
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.440
can become disciples of Jesus Christ.

193
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.320
The importance of a Bible teacher in reproducing themselves and developing an

194
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.760
apprentice cannot be overstated. As a Bible teacher,

195
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.800
the primary responsibility is to ensure the continuity and stability

196
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.880
of effective Bible teaching for the future. And how do we do that? Well,

197
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.200
we make disciples who make disciples.

198
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.000
That's the mission and vision of our church.

199
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.280
We develop a capable apprentice in the community group,

200
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.840
and then we pass on our wisdom and our experience and our skills.

201
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.800
We encourage and we coach them. And then in doing so,

202
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.120
we create a seamless transition when the time comes for community group to

203
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.240
multiply and start a new group. So, developing an apprentice Bible teachers,

204
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.040
not just ensuring a, a smooth succession plan in the community group,

205
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.400
but also understanding how God raises up leaders to effectively navigate the

206
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.960
future growth of the class.

207
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.920
Now remember we talked about the modern landscape and how the, the, uh,

208
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.040
spiritual landscape seems to be eroding with all new challenges and

209
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.840
difficulties. Well,

210
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:02.200
Bible teachers who've been uniquely designed by God can think creatively

211
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.160
and teach in a manner that empowers their apprentice

212
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.203
Bible teacher.

213
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.440
And then the new Bible teacher can infuse this fresh per fresh perspective

214
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.440
that only God has given him with a unique viewpoint into the teacher's role.

215
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.920
So not only is the, uh, church's strengths, uh,

216
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.680
have the ability to navigate navigate complex situations,

217
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.360
it instills as,

218
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.040
as a teacher develops an apprentice who then begins to teach their own class.

219
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.400
The class then learns a sense of trust and loyalty among fellow members,

220
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.720
knowing that their Bible teacher is committed to their growth and their

221
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.080
launching as instruments of grace in the kingdom of God.

222
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.400
So ultimately,

223
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.400
the act of reproducing oneself as a Bible teachers transcends

224
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.160
any individual accomplishments and self-interests because it becomes a vital

225
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.360
aspect of building a resilient and forward-looking church that can thrive

226
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.600
in an ever-changing world. Uh,

227
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.480
my wife has a beautiful illustration that says, uh,

228
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.480
a wise teacher is one who plants acorns knowing full well they will never sit

229
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.080
under the shade of the oak tree to come.

230
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.600
So we're learning that developing a Bible teaching apprentice

231
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.240
fosters a culture of growth and learning within the community group,

232
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.200
and it motivates the community group members to recognize the value of spiritual

233
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.680
growth and want to invest themselves in their own spiritual development.

234
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.920
Um, and this is also how a Bible teacher develops a legacy not

235
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.280
only in their ability to teach the Bible,

236
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.480
but also on their ability to impact the future of future Bible teachers.

237
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.040
So let's, let's just be honest for a minute.

238
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.520
Disciple making is difficult because, uh, we have mutually loving relationships.

239
00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.400
Bible teachers develop strong bonds of relationships between, uh,

240
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.640
group community group members, and, uh,

241
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.520
they're encouraged to grow deeper in their relationship with one another.

242
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.353
And then they do.

243
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.480
And then we ask these same community group members to leave those relationships

244
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.520
and start a new community group.

245
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.600
And it cannot happen without a Bible teacher casting the vision if the Bible

246
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.080
teacher doesn't cast the vision.

247
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.840
And if the Bible teacher doubts the effectiveness of the multiplication process,

248
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.400
the process then becomes confusing and leads to frustration.

249
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.440
But disciple making community group Bible teachers educate the people about the

250
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.473
disciple making process.

251
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.360
They take time to describe and envision and invest in this process.

252
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.000
They describe the whys of disciple making as well as the hows of multiplying.

253
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.320
Now, it would by be naive for discipleship,

254
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.960
making teachers to expect anyone just to jump on board the multiplication

255
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.680
process without explaining it or believing in them, in it with themselves.

256
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.640
But with time and patience and love,

257
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.720
the in the instruction of the community group can,

258
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.720
they'll begin to understand and maybe adapt to this disciple making process.

259
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.360
Every community group teacher must remember that the group, the community group,

260
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:19.480
class members don't belong to them, rather they belong to God.

261
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.560
In fact, community group members are just on loan from God,

262
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.480
and thus for just a short period of time,

263
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.520
because God has entrusted Bible teachers with responsibility of caring for their

264
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:34.520
souls and feeding them spiritually so that they can grow up and become mature

265
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.320
men and women of faith, and then begin to serve him using their own gifts.

266
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.160
God never intended a community group member to sit in a class for many,

267
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.040
many years, most of their lives,

268
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.800
and never experienced the joy and fulfillment of getting out on their own and

269
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.600
making disciples of Jesus. Uh, I remember having children in the home,

270
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.960
and I loved being a dad.

271
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.880
And then there was a period where they were middle schoolers,

272
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.440
and we began to understand these kids are growing up and they became teenagers.

273
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.960
And, uh, and I loved my teenagers, but it was a challenging time.

274
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.520
And there was a point in the life of these teenagers where I was thinking,

275
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.680
I think it's time for them to get out on their own.

276
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.480
And how sad would it be if my 30 and 40 year old, uh, children,

277
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.760
adult children, still lived at home with me? But no,

278
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.440
they're out and they're making their way in the Lord and using the, uh,

279
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.160
gifts that God has given them. And that's how disciples are made.

280
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.320
A Bible teacher's job is complete when he is equipped people to the point that

281
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.800
they understand the purpose of their own calling,

282
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.000
and then they seek a place to minister. So in conclusion,

283
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.920
the role of a Bible teachers carries immense value and biblical responsibility

284
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.600
to shape hearts and minds of people that the Bible teacher teaches.

285
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.000
And with the support of a trustworthy

286
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.840
And doctrinally sound curriculum,

287
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.520
that the Bible teacher holds the power to guide the community group members into

288
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.640
spiritual maturity and to lead them to dive deeper into the timeless wisdom

289
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.960
scripture for themselves. However, the ultimate goal is this. We,

290
00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.520
as we embrace Jesus noble calling,

291
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.920
we usher in a transformative ripple effect that touches lives

292
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.560
far beyond our immediate reach.

293
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.960
We foster a legacy of faith and love and wisdom that endures for

294
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.793
generations.

295
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.160
And together let us learn to take up the mantle of disciple making with

296
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.200
dedication and passion, because in our hands,

297
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.720
we hold the ability and the potential to shape not just the individual,

298
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.080
but to help accomplish God's mission,

299
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.160
to reach the world with the good news of Jesus Christ.
