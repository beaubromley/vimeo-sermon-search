00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
So I wore my glasses simply because I forgot my

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.500
contacts. So what I want to show you is it's a

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.200
miracle watch this. It's like a magic trick.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.100
60 to

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.100
52 yeah. All right. So but this is the real

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.300
me so you're gonna have to get get over it. All right. So let's

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.700
go and get started. This this sent t-shirt

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.900
is a prop because we've

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.400
been talking about how do I make a

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.500
disciple? Well the first

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
first step that we've talked about of course and make

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.500
sure step on anything here is how to identify a

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.600
disciple. First of all, they are dedicated which means they've given

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.300
their lives to Christ. They've been they've received the Holy

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.100
Spirit and now the Holy Spirit can guide them

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
into truth and protect them and to use

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.800
them in ways, but but now we're moving from

18
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.900
Developing and we went from you

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.300
know dedicated but by being born again

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.200
to developing by learning the inner character, we'll

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.500
talk about this in a minute and the outward competencies of Christ and

22
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
tonight we're talking about are they deploy deployed into

23
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
the world? And so I want to take you to the

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.500
to the this is called the high

25
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.900
Priestly prayer in John 17. Jesus is praying. This

26
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.700
is before the crucifixion. He's ours before

27
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.500
the crucifixion and he's praying

28
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.700
and he this this prayer is recorded for us and the

29
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.600
one verse that I wanted you to see was as he's

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.100
praying to the father. He's praying for his disciples and he

31
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.200
says Lord as you sent me into the

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.600
world, so I have sent them into

33
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.300
the world and some of you heard this story

34
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.500
when I was not looking to

35
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200
move. I was in an excellent Church

36
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.300
in North Dallas and my mom fell and broke her hip

37
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.100
and on the same day my daughter sent me it.

38
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.400
Link to the job opening at Henderson

39
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.300
Hills and I knew of Henderson Hills years and

40
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
years and years ago because I was a youth pastor in Tulsa

41
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.800
and a pastor in Tulsa. I knew what God had done here over the years.

42
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.500
but I wasn't interested until I read the vision

43
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.200
statement in the mission state in the mission statement as a

44
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.800
we're equipping one another to love Jesus and to live and when

45
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.500
I saw those words live sent I thought this church

46
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.100
has done some heavy sledding these this is a

47
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.200
new way of saying let's let's get

48
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.600
Let's get busy with the Great Commission and it

49
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.800
took me back to this passage right here. What did Jesus leave

50
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.400
in order to come and to

51
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.000
be born of a virgin and to live a sinless life

52
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.000
and to die in our place? What did he leave?

53
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.200
Unless left the glory of heaven, right? This is

54
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
a Philippians 2 when we should be like Christ

55
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.700
who?

56
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.300
Who literally gave himself to become a servant and die on

57
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.700
a cross?

58
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.400
So he left the glory of heaven and he left the

59
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
the Majesty of the cosmos to become

60
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400
an infant baby boy born in a trough

61
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.200
to lie, lying among the sheep manure

62
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.400
and sweat of the of The

63
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
Human Experience. That's a long way. He went

64
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.600
a long way for us. And so now he saying

65
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.300
as you sent me

66
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.600
I am sending them which takes which

67
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.400
gives the Great Commission just kind

68
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.500
of a very precise understanding when he says go

69
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.800
therefore. We know that the the

70
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.100
syntax of the Greek means as you

71
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.400
are going but whether whether you know, no

72
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.800
matter the syntax, this is an action word. So when

73
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.600
it says that we are to be deployed into

74
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.300
the world. I want you to see what we do

75
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.800
in this pathway. What's the purpose of a pathway? This

76
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.400
is not a hard question.

77
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.100
What's the purpose of a pathway?

78
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.300
Yes to move you from one destination to another

79
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.300
and so we love you and God will

80
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.100
take you just as you are but we're not

81
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.400
going to be satisfied. If you are just continuing to

82
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.400
come just to the worship service. You don't know anybody. You

83
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.000
don't speak to anyone. No one checks in on you to see

84
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.300
how you're doing. We're going to try to move you from one

85
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.000
destination to another and I was very very pleased when I

86
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.600
ask you to raise your hand to see if you're in a community group because I would say 90% of

87
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.100
you are in a community group, and that's great. But what

88
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.400
I'm gonna ask you to do is as you moved from

89
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.200
just the large worship experience into the

90
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.300
community group and and from the anonymous.

91
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.100
safety of a darken roomed all facing the

92
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.700
same direction Listening to A good sermon to the

93
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.400
anxiety of a community group where people actually want

94
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.300
to know your name. It's a little forward don't

95
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.800
you think right? But no

96
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800
not only do they want to know your name. They want to help you carry your burdens.

97
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.500
They want to ask you where you are in your relationship

98
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.300
with Christ, but we can go even a step further

99
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.800
and remember go there for and to

100
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.700
All Nations make disciples. So we're

101
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.000
learning that these gender-based micro groups

102
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.600
with an intentional leader and a relational

103
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.500
environment and a reproducible process. This is

104
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500
The Sweet Spot. This is where we want to be right here.

105
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.400
We will spawn one-on-one groups

106
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400
and we do have already a significant number

107
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
of ladies who are in a mentor relationship, which is

108
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.100
fantastic. But this is where we're going to

109
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.500
spend most of our time on Wednesday nights. These are

110
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.200
the essentials.

111
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.900
An intentional leader. I am praying that

112
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.200
you will consider becoming an

113
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.300
intentional leader and in

114
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.800
doing so you'll know that it is only your responsibility by

115
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.200
the way. It's a program.

116
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.700
There's nothing wrong with programs. It's just that they don't do a great job discipling

117
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.300
people. Okay, a program

118
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.300
has to start date and the stop date and a leader and a lot of people sit

119
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.600
and listen and participate by just watching but an intentional

120
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.300
leader one day. I'm going to deptise you

121
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.600
we probably won't have a time when we raise our hands but

122
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.800
a deputize you say now, you're the intentional leader. Don't wait

123
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.100
for pastor Phil to call and say okay.

124
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.700
I've got a group for you. You're ready to go. I'm not gonna do that. All right.

125
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.300
I might try to put you know

126
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.000
somebody who wants to be discipled in a

127
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.200
group that's already meeting, but I'm not going to be assembling these groups

128
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.100
and that's the job of an intentional leader. We're

129
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.600
gonna talk a little bit more about that. All right and in relational environment and

130
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.300
a reproducible process now,

131
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.600
I like to recruit somebody to do this for me next

132
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.000
week. Okay, when I

133
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.100
get to the end, I'm going to ask for a show of

134
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.300
hands and I'm just gonna pick one of you because there'd be dozens who want to do this next

135
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.500
week. All right. So the large

136
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.100
group Jesus had a large group. We know that he

137
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.600
had the feeding of the 5,000 and the feeding of the four thousand, but

138
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.400
we also know that he had his disciples there were

139
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.200
12 of those but he also had the super disciples which were Peter James

140
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.900
and John and so we this is we see

141
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.100
this in the life of Jesus, but we also see in the life of

142
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.600
Henderson Hills. We'll have our fifth. Oops.

143
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.500
Coming back. Hello. We'll have our 1500 on

144
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.600
Sunday mornings. We'll have you know, three three or

145
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.300
four hundred on an equipping night. One

146
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.100
of I'm gonna poke fun at my

147
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.500
wife for a minute. We were just here a few days when we

148
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.300
had a great big Vacation Bible School. What do

149
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.600
we call it here?

150
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.700
Vacation Bible School, that's what

151
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.100
Idea, I think we should stay with that.

152
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.500
But we had Parents night and

153
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.100
people came out in droves and we

154
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.500
had a great opening meeting and then we went out to eat pizza. They put

155
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.600
the new people in the sun just so you know, so my

156
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.300
wife looks so pretty and you know, we're trying to make a good impression

157
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.900
and then we put us to feed Pizza in the Sun not a

158
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.500
lot of dishes went on that night. But anyway,

159
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.400
But but these are important these are pointing people. So why

160
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.400
so maybe we can get them involved in the community group and how many in a

161
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.300
community group well depends on the size, but I've seen as many

162
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.400
as 40 in a community group, but what we're asking you

163
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.700
to do is to move towards a micro Group, which

164
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.700
is three or four.

165
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.400
not three-fourths

166
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.000
three or four

167
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.400
and the reason is is that as the

168
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.200
group gets smaller the opportunity for

169
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.900
transparency and honesty

170
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.500
and even vulnerability and genuine

171
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.200
intimacy, which

172
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.100
leads to what I'm hopeful will be

173
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.400
accountability that increases so we're talking about

174
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.200
what did we just say we talked about

175
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.000
transparency?

176
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.400
We talked about vulnerability vulnerability we

177
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.300
talked about intimacy.

178
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.000
And eventually accountability and this

179
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.400
is a this is where we're headed. And

180
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.300
this is what we're hoping will happen. Again, we're talking

181
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.800
about movement talking about going being sent.

182
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.100
I want you to see as this pertains to the definition

183
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.000
of a disciple one who is following Jesus. That's an

184
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.300
action term. It's not something that I follow Jesus

185
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.300
when I was seven and I've been a Christian all my life. No, it's a

186
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.300
day by day minute by minute Breath by

187
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.000
breath thought by thought word by word following Jesus.

188
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.000
Being changed by Jesus. So one of

189
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.200
our maxims is that discipleship is

190
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.400
not about information. It's about transformation. So we're being changed by

191
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.400
Jesus and we're committed to the mission of Jesus making disciples.

192
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.200
So it's not enough just to be

193
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.100
discipled. We are discipled for the purpose of

194
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.200
becoming a disciple maker. So again, you

195
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.500
see the movement the scentness of this

196
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.500
idea that Jesus gave us and again,

197
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.200
I won't spend a lot of time on this in your

198
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.800
notebook. I I added to this disciple

199
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.900
profile page. I gave

200
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.400
you a list of bullet list of things that

201
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.100
you might look for when trying to identify what stage

202
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.600
of discipleship you're in.

203
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.100
Now this is important because we're all

204
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.200
working at becoming disciple makers which

205
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.800
means that we would go from the young adult stage

206
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.700
of Spiritual Development to the parent stage

207
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.600
of Spiritual Development. Now the parent then becomes

208
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.200
responsible for those whom God has

209
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.000
entrusted to him. And now what would then be a grandparent

210
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.400
stage of Spiritual Development? That means that

211
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.400
the people that I have discipled are now

212
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.500
discipling others.

213
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.400
And so you see that again that sentness that

214
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.100
movement that multiplicity the reproducible process.

215
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.200
That's where we're headed in

216
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.400
the right direction. Okay.

217
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.500
So let's let's go back now here

218
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.200
to Matthew 9 now, this is Jesus.

219
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.300
If you would read in verse 35, you would see that

220
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.800
he was traveling and he was taking the

221
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.500
gospel on the road. He was teaching

222
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.300
about the kingdom of God and he began

223
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.100
to see people in the condition that they were

224
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.800
in and this is what it says. When he Jesus saw

225
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.400
the crowds he had compassion for them.

226
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.000
Why

227
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.300
because they were harassed and helpless like

228
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.700
sheep without a Shepherd now if

229
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.200
you look at the Greek terms for

230
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.900
harassed and helpless, it's even worse than harassed and

231
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.300
helpless.

232
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.900
Means that they are pitiful that

233
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.000
they are in danger, they are like open

234
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.300
wound scarred. And so

235
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.400
when he sees people without a shepherd

236
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.700
He thinks to himself this is so so sad

237
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.200
God designed them for more than

238
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.300
this and this is what they've come to now before we move

239
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.200
to the next step to jesus' solution. Let's talk

240
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.800
a little bit about today.

241
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.200
In my lifetime and again, I'm only 50 but no,

242
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.700
I'm 62 in my lifetime. There

243
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.100
has never been as many people as lonely

244
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.600
and disengaged as there are

245
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:04.700
today.

246
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.100
As a result of rapid growth the

247
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.500
lengthening of life.

248
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.100
a multiplicity of generations in the

249
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.000
same culture

250
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.900
the development of a global pandemic forcing

251
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.100
people home to watch screens to have

252
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.600
relationships.

253
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.200
Simultaneously having screens where they don't

254
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.100
have to talk to one another. Let's just let's just be

255
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.400
honest for a minute how many of you've gone to a restaurant and

256
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.800
you've seen it two people sitting at the same time table not

257
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.100
talking to one another but instead they were looking at their I mean

258
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.400
raise your hand if you ever seen that look see we're not

259
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.500
we don't relate to one another anymore the the

260
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.000
concept of community the communal intimacy that

261
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.200
coin and Nia Desire with God

262
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.900
gave us on the inside. It's not a part of our culture any longer.

263
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.700
We know it in the Christian world. We

264
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.900
know it in the in the church life. But but what

265
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.100
what do you think is going on in the Heart of

266
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.300
Jesus now as he looks to the crowds

267
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.400
Same thing. This is not why how how I

268
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.500
created you? This is not what this is not God's

269
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.700
loving design. Do you father back

270
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.300
to the high Priestly Port? May they be one as you

271
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.100
and I are father are one.

272
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.400
You and me and I and you and but we're disengaged

273
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.400
we're disenfranchised and we

274
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.200
were living this life alone. And that has never

275
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.700
been God's design. So what's got what's Jesus solution very next

276
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.100
verse.

277
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.900
Then he said to his disciples.

278
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.900
To harvest is plentiful.

279
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.300
What's the Harvest?

280
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.300
It's the harassed and helpless people that have

281
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.400
no Shepherd the Sheep without a

282
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:49.600
shepherd.

283
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.800
The Harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are

284
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.400
few.

285
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600
Jesus solution for the harassed

286
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.600
and helpless multitudes are to pray

287
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.000
earnestly to the lord of the Harvest to

288
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.500
send out laborers into the

289
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:07.900
Harvest.

290
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.000
So what's what is Jesus plan that Jesus jesus'

291
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.600
plan is to pray.

292
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.800
What are we to pray for?

293
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.500
laborers

294
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.000
to send I've heard this word before somewhere into the

295
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.700
Harvest. And so this is this has

296
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.700
been Jesus plan from the very beginning. So I want

297
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.100
to give you some a little bit more inside of

298
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.700
kind of a peek behind the micro group curtain. What

299
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.200
is it intentional leader do well building a disciple

300
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.000
making micro group?

301
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.500
A disciple making this is what you need is an intentional

302
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.400
leader that is not the focal point, but they

303
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.400
are part of the group process. One of

304
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.800
the things that happens in most Sunday schools.

305
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.300
now or life groups or Community groups

306
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.900
or whatever you want to call them is that they have a teacher and they

307
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.700
should have a teacher because that teachers signed up

308
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.000
and Covenant and become responsible for wanting to

309
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.400
to learn the lessons so that they can teach the lesson

310
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.800
and typically it's the teacher speaking and a

311
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.900
good good a really good teacher will ask

312
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.400
thought-provoking question open-ended questions so that people will respond

313
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.200
but even at the end of this lesson, we know

314
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.700
that the focal point of the lesson was the teacher

315
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200
That's not what we're trying to do in a micro group.

316
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.400
Okay, a micro group has an intentional leader, but that intentional leader

317
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.700
is not the focal point point. They're inserting

318
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.000
themselves into the group as a part of the group process number

319
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.300
two.

320
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.200
The intentional leader intentionally shifts leadership from

321
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.300
a hierarchy.

322
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.300
you know at a higher hierarchy is right at the

323
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.300
Pope

324
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.700
College of cardinals priests

325
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.400
Bishops say I used somebody gonna help me here because I I've

326
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.700
been a Baptist a very long time.

327
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.800
You know and eventually you get down to the that's

328
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.200
that's a hierarchy it's very very important in Catholicism in

329
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.000
the cat in the Baptist Church at Henderson

330
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.000
Hills. We've got

331
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.700
the elders.

332
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.400
And which would include a couple of

333
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.500
guys on our staff of our ministerial staff our pastoral staff and

334
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.500
then we've got our support staff there. There's a hierarchy because it it helps

335
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.200
us get things done. But when we

336
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.000
come to a micro group,

337
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.800
The intentional leader is intentionally shifting

338
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.300
away from I am the focal point

339
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.300
and I am the solution to

340
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.400
the questions you have.

341
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.700
You might even know the answer.

342
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.200
To the question that's asked but as an

343
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.200
intentional leader, you'd say well, I don't know. What do you guys think?

344
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.900
Why are you doing that? Because you're trying to involve the group in

345
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.200
a group discussion. You might

346
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.100
have all the answers but as an intentional leader, you're not

347
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.500
answering all the answers. You're trying to break down that hierarchy and

348
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.800
make this more of a.

349
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.700
Of a peer relationship. Okay, two more

350
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.900
an intentional leader shifts from dialogue that's

351
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.200
conversation between two people to a dynamic interchange.

352
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.300
Can conversation involving the entire micro group?

353
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.100
There's something very very powerful when

354
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.500
an intentional leader. It doesn't become

355
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.900
the the solution person doesn't become

356
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.200
the the hierarchy all answer to

357
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.100
everyone's question. But if that intentional leader can can instead

358
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.600
of being the answer person point

359
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.500
people to Jesus.

360
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.500
A great question in a micro group is what do you think Jesus would do

361
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.900
in this situation?

362
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:40.300
You know.

363
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.300
Have you ever been in a situation like this? What did you do?

364
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.100
And and you're bringing the entire group in I think

365
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.400
I've told you guys this story before when David Bailey came

366
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.500
to my my group have a

367
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.300
great story about this that I can't tell because

368
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.600
it's still in process, but David Bailey came and he dominated the

369
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.200
entire micro group and I felt like

370
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.400
such a miserable failure because he was telling us how

371
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.200
he was leaving his wife and the reasons why he was leaving his wife

372
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.200
and why it was the right answer and we were all just

373
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.100
kind of sitting there and died on the inside.

374
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.600
And so well, I guess I'll see you guys next Tuesday. If anybody comes back, you

375
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.500
know, and everybody comes back and and over

376
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.600
a period of months. We saw through this

377
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.500
group dynamic and the work of the Holy Spirit. We begin

378
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.600
to see God do things in David's life that he himself could

379
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.100
not expect.

380
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.200
and he asked

381
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.800
at the IHOP at 7 AM during the

382
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.400
prayer request.

383
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.000
I don't know what God's trying to teach me.

384
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.900
Okay, I do.

385
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.500
You're not supposed to leave your wife.

386
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.400
She's bringing you back. He's bringing her back. You're supposed

387
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.500
to be that Jesus in the situation. You welcome her

388
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.200
with open Open Arms. You tell her how thankful you

389
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200
are that God brought. I know the answer to this.

390
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.500
But I just waited and Rusty.

391
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.700
I'll never forget it.

392
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.200
Rusty says

393
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.800
he is this dull look for honestly like duh. He's

394
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.000
like

395
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.600
I've been praying for you every day since you came.

396
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.000
and it was like a holy spirit was just like

397
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.700
Man, I don't know if you've ever been in a moment where the

398
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.700
power of power of the Holy Spirit was so palpable, but

399
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.000
that's when you realize we are making

400
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.400
disciples.

401
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.200
And God is is his hand is here. And and

402
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.600
it is his spirit is pulsing

403
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.400
through the lies and the hearts and the spirits

404
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.700
of the people in this group. And that's that's what I'm I'm hoping

405
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.700
will happen for you guys.

406
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.200
And then lastly the intentional leader shifts the

407
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.900
vision from addition to multiplication.

408
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.600
I've been at this church

409
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.800
now for two and a half months. I

410
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.300
you probably know the answer to this. What is the number one

411
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.400
request for Community groups to the

412
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.800
community group leader.

413
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.700
Getting ready to guess.

414
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.900
We need a what?

415
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.200
Bigger room absolutely about 50% of

416
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.200
our community groups need a bigger room. Why because they need more

417
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.600
people.

418
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.500
Right. I don't blame them praise God. He's blessed

419
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.400
you that direction but in a micro group, we're

420
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.500
not as concerned with addition. Like, how

421
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.700
big is your micro group? We're up

422
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.100
to six. Well, it's too big. All right.

423
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.400
Well, we got eight. Let's see. We're not building. We're

424
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.300
not adding. What are we doing? We're multiplying we start at

425
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.200
the very front saying that God is going to

426
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.000
move us.

427
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.400
Closer to him and closer to

428
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.700
one another so that one day when we sense

429
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.000
that God.

430
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.200
grown us to the right

431
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.200
place as disciple makers. We're all going

432
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.400
to lead our own disciple group.

433
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.500
So from the very beginning this guy is thinking or this

434
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.000
gas thinking.

435
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.800
I could be a leader. I could be an intentional leader.

436
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.500
So our our focus is not on addition. Our focus

437
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.800
is on multiplication. Okay?

438
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.300
So with that, let me

439
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.800
see. What did I forget? Did I forget anything?

440
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.500
Okay. Yes.

441
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.600
In your notebook and I again

442
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.900
we're inching up on this. Alrighty.

443
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.300
I want to say thank you guys for coming back every week

444
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.200
because the very first week I split you into groups

445
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.600
and you're like

446
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.500
unexpect this

447
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.100
you know, and I don't know how many are here, but

448
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.200
it's probably a little less than the week before a little less than the week before little less than

449
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.300
a week before that doesn't seem that doesn't bother me that much really people

450
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.800
have got good reasons for coming or for

451
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.100
not coming but that's really not again. We're not

452
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.900
about addition. We're about multiplication and

453
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.300
so one day at the end of our

454
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.100
12 weeks together. We're a week five right now.

455
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.100
Some of you guys are going to go out on faith. And I said, I think

456
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.200
I'm going to do this. I think I'm gonna do this and so in the

457
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.300
curriculum that I've provided for you it

458
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.300
it gives you three steps to getting started with a micro

459
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.700
group. And the first one is to pray.

460
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.100
Ask the Lord to put on your heart the person to whom he is

461
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.400
drawing you to belong.

462
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.200
Okay, what you're looking for is a fat person and that's

463
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.900
an acronym for faithful available and teachable.

464
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.300
All right, so you're looking for someone who's faithful

465
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.700
available and teachable and let

466
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.300
me ask you this.

467
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.800
Anytime somebody starts a question like this, you know, the answer already is

468
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.100
God big enough.

469
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.700
Is God big enough to already have some person that you

470
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.800
know that needs to be discipled?

471
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.400
That you can pray about and when he reveals to you that yeah,

472
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.500
I want you to enter into her discipleship relationship

473
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.500
with that person is God big enough to have that person already

474
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:02.800
in mind.

475
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.000
curious

476
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.200
All you need to do is pray. Who is that father?

477
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.700
So that I can code to them and here's this next

478
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.500
step is invite.

479
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.800
Okay, let me let me tell you a way not to do it.

480
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.400
I've been to disciple making 101 and now I'm into something

481
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.900
maker and I'm gonna

482
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.400
I'm gonna ask you if you want to be in my group.

483
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.200
All right, because it's gonna be good. You know,

484
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.200
I'm really good. That's not that that's you've

485
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.400
forgotten everything. We said about hierarchy and

486
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.100
focal point and you know, what would you

487
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.300
do say something in your own words kind of like this?

488
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.400
I want you to pray about something.

489
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.400
That was the question. My minister of Youth asked me when I was 12 years

490
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.500
old.

491
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.500
And no one had ever asked me to pray about anything.

492
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.500
And so the answer was yes before. Yeah. I have nobody wanted

493
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.200
right, but I want you to pray about something. Will you

494
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.600
pray about joining me as we walk together and grow

495
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.200
to become better Disciples of Jesus Christ?

496
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.300
So it's not me doing this for you. It's us doing

497
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:07.800
this together.

498
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.200
Okay, I'd like to invite you to meet with me and one or

499
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.600
two others weekly for the purpose of the coming all

500
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.300
the Lord intends us to be.

501
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:18.900
and

502
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.400
you can finish up by saying I've been praying about this. I remember the

503
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.800
night. We were there on a Wednesday night and that new

504
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.300
that new Pastor said start praying

505
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.400
about it. Do you think God's a big enough? And I and you know what God put you

506
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:33.900
on my mind.

507
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.700
I would love for you to be in my group.

508
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.800
I love for us to do this together.

509
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.300
And because I feel like the Lord

510
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.400
led me to ask you this question.

511
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.100
That's all you have to do and then let the Holy Spirit do his work.

512
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.300
And then once you guys have got a group I don't care about this

513
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.200
three or four and I again, this is this is you're

514
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.300
the intentional leader you guys you decide when you meet where you meet

515
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.000
and how long you meet. I think you have to do at least

516
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.400
in an hour. Some would say an hour and a half. I think that sometimes hard to

517
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.600
schedule an hour and a half. But but you

518
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.400
just once you've got a group you start meeting and

519
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.500
you you decide on the location of a

520
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.400
relation, there are

521
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.500
some restaurants that you cannot have a relational environment.

522
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.300
And my wife and I had lunch today at a place I won't tell where it is because everybody knows

523
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.200
it's been what I'm talking about, but they were

524
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:27.700
having a church meeting.

525
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.700
And the pastor was just over there screaming as loud

526
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.700
as he could and Carol kept saying that I didn't

527
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.300
know we're coming to church for lunch. But anyway, I think

528
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.100
they were talking about a trip that they were wanting to take and stuff. But

529
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.000
but a relational environment is where you can hear one another.

530
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.800
And where long periods of Silence?

531
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.300
Are not awkward because there's so much going on, you know,

532
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.000
anyway, praying about that. That's that's

533
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.300
that is begin practicing in

534
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.000
your own words how you might invite somebody.
