1
00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:00.675
All right.

2
00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:03.475
Welcome to Digging Deeper

3
00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:06.515
on Wednesday night here at Henderson Hills.

4
00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:09.115
Grateful to have you here,

5
00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:12.995
and we're grateful to get to do this in a free country,

6
00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:17.635
a free, um, location that we've got, the comfort level

7
00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.355
that we have here, the great food we have beforehand.

8
00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:22.235
It's, uh, a gift. We don't take that

9
00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:23.555
for granted from the Lord's hand.

10
00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.755
And so hopefully you can remember God's goodness in that

11
00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.075
as well tonight.

12
00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:31.955
And we look forward to studying a little more deeply what we

13
00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.715
touched on briefly on Sunday.

14
00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:38.715
Uh, so thankful for that. Thankful for you being here.

15
00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:43.155
And, uh, so I preface all this with, uh, the reality that,

16
00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:44.835
uh, I got a lot of questions already.

17
00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:49.115
And so we may, may or may not get to open q and a.

18
00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.075
We'll see how that goes, uh,

19
00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.755
as naturally you can imagine with this one.

20
00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.795
Uh, but, uh, if you have something, of course, feel free

21
00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:58.275
to ask.

22
00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.755
Uh, Aaron's here, tr is scheduled to be here,

23
00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:02.875
but he's involved in a surgery right now.

24
00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.835
Uh, not that he's getting surgery.

25
00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:07.595
He is a surgeon, so he's trying to make it here.

26
00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:10.395
Uh, I'll have Aaron and TR come up, or just Aaron later,

27
00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.515
but find us in the lobby afterwards.

28
00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:16.595
Make sure you have those questions. Email us.

29
00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:18.875
We want to talk through this, uh,

30
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.035
but also realize that we won't get everything

31
00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.595
answered in a few minutes.

32
00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:24.555
And these are complicated

33
00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:29.235
and, um, debated for

34
00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:31.755
2000 years, really.

35
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.035
And so we're trying to figure this out in a few minutes.

36
00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:37.835
Uh, and, and there's implications, there's questions.

37
00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:41.515
And, and so, again, remember in this series,

38
00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:43.115
we're looking at the big rocks first.

39
00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:45.595
That was what we spent seven weeks on at least

40
00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:46.715
a few of those big rocks.

41
00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:48.395
And then we got to these smaller rocks,

42
00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:52.915
which we talked about that are what churches, in a sense,

43
00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.235
quote unquote, divide over things

44
00:01:55.235 --> 00:01:58.155
that we can't worship in the same worship setting together

45
00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:01.115
because of infant baptism versus believers baptism,

46
00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:02.875
for example, or speaking in tongues.

47
00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.995
And, and so next Sunday, this coming Sunday,

48
00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:07.115
we're gonna get to the sand.

49
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:09.875
We're gonna look at ways that we can disagree

50
00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.075
and differ on things and still be in the same body,

51
00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:13.555
still be in the same small group even.

52
00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.075
But this one, this idea of reform theology

53
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:20.035
and those kind of things that surround, that, the terms

54
00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:24.235
that all surround, that it, it is kind of, uh,

55
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:28.595
a small rock in a sense that that's our flavor as a church.

56
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:31.395
And, and so I wanna make sure that you're clear about that.

57
00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:32.515
We don't wanna hide that.

58
00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.155
But at the same time, it's not something that we're trying

59
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.075
to jam down everybody's throat as this system

60
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:40.955
being the only right system.

61
00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:42.875
It's how we interpret how we come up with, uh,

62
00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.875
our theological ideas.

63
00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:49.515
But, but really this is also in the same vein, a kind of a,

64
00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:51.075
a kind of sand issue

65
00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:53.515
where we can differ on the nuances of these things.

66
00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:54.955
And if it talks about a big rock,

67
00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:56.475
then we gotta land together on that.

68
00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:58.955
But if it's an implication or if it's understanding

69
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:00.125
and how to interpret that,

70
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:01.525
then maybe there can be some difference.

71
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:03.125
We'll talk a little bit about that as we go through.

72
00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:06.005
Uh, but I also wanna talk about this just upfront.

73
00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:07.405
This is not new for our church.

74
00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:12.045
This is something that this church has held for, uh, 30

75
00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:14.125
years-ish, somewhere around there.

76
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.165
This is where we've landed as a church.

77
00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:17.765
So we're not just coming up with this

78
00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:19.005
and kind of taking a stance

79
00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:22.045
and saying, Hey, we're now this, this is what we have been.

80
00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.845
So this is not new. Just trying to articulate a distinctive,

81
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:30.245
uh, if you haven't heard that before, that's okay,

82
00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.085
because this is not what we're making the flag

83
00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:35.765
of our church wanna make it a, a reality, a skeleton

84
00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:39.245
of course, but also realize that this is,

85
00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:40.685
this is something that's not new.

86
00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:41.805
We're coming up with something different.

87
00:03:41.835 --> 00:03:43.725
This is what we have believed.

88
00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:47.525
It's also what most baptists have believed throughout

89
00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:51.685
history, uh, apart from the last 150 years about where, uh,

90
00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:53.885
there's been some new waves of things coming up.

91
00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:57.365
But most Baptists were reformed in their belief systems.

92
00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.565
And so that made kind of jar some of your categories.

93
00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.045
But that's, that's the reality

94
00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:05.565
of when you look back at history of, of Baptist life,

95
00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:07.165
it's been mostly this.

96
00:04:08.235 --> 00:04:11.885
Plus, when we talk about these things, we're not promoting

97
00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.285
or, or championing a person.

98
00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:17.325
Uh, this is not because John Calvin or Martin Luther

99
00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:18.805
or anyone else said these things.

100
00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:20.205
What we care most is about

101
00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:21.925
what God's word says about these things.

102
00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:26.805
And so whenever you feel like there's a bit of this, uh,

103
00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.365
I get kind of pushed back a little bit in my own beliefs,

104
00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:33.405
and you're feeling that a little bit, if it forces you

105
00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:36.685
to go study your Bible, that's a good thing, right?

106
00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:40.005
We want everyone to be able to, to be encouraged

107
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:41.685
that this is what we need to be doing.

108
00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:44.565
Uh, so when you go, go read and, and go study

109
00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:47.045
and go try to dig out some of the implications

110
00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:48.885
and where you can get to that as well.

111
00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:52.045
So just as all preface material, let, let's keep

112
00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:53.605
that in mind as we go to it.

113
00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:58.445
And as we come to it, let's approach this issue with respect

114
00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.605
and love for a believer in Christ, a brother,

115
00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:05.365
a sister in Christ that might differ a little bit on

116
00:05:05.365 --> 00:05:07.125
where they land in these things.

117
00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:11.885
Now, this is not something that we should be, uh, I,

118
00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:14.005
I've alluded to this, others have said it this way.

119
00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:18.085
Cage stage in our belief system where like you're just going

120
00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:20.085
around looking for theological cage matches

121
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.085
for fights all the time.

122
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:24.005
Like that's not, uh, that's not what this is about.

123
00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:25.645
Shouldn't be what this is about.

124
00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:27.885
So we're just gonna look at the scriptures

125
00:05:27.905 --> 00:05:30.805
and, uh, there's gonna be res as a result

126
00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:32.165
of the study at any study like this,

127
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.445
there's gonna be questions,

128
00:05:34.115 --> 00:05:36.565
there's gonna be mysterious pieces of this.

129
00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:38.605
Some of these questions will be unanswerable

130
00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:40.885
until we get to the other side.

131
00:05:41.995 --> 00:05:44.615
Uh, but the, the scriptures that we're gonna look at and,

132
00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:46.535
and really philosophical arguments

133
00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:49.575
that we look at in these things, both for

134
00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:54.135
and against whatever system that you might ascribe to, uh,

135
00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:57.565
there really is that, which is why it is something we have

136
00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.605
to be holding carefully, loosely.

137
00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:01.205
We have to hold it humbly.

138
00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:05.365
But since there are questions, I mentioned this on Sunday,

139
00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:08.405
the way we start matters.

140
00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:14.525
So either way, you start in this idea, this any system,

141
00:06:14.705 --> 00:06:16.925
either way you start, there's gonna be questions in the

142
00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:19.815
middle, there's gonna be questions about implications.

143
00:06:20.675 --> 00:06:22.615
So either way, there's going to be questions.

144
00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.895
And so what we've chosen to do is just simply say,

145
00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:25.895
we're gonna start top down.

146
00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:29.775
You could start bottom up, kind of with humans first,

147
00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:32.295
and then figure out implications and questions

148
00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:34.815
and how that works out with God and who he is.

149
00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:37.695
We've chosen to start with God,

150
00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:39.845
and then work down from there

151
00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:42.405
and figure out the questions that will inevitably come.

152
00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:45.325
Yes. But we feel like there's fewer questions that way.

153
00:06:45.385 --> 00:06:48.165
And we feel like the answers that we wouldn't get

154
00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:51.295
are answered by, oh, God is God.

155
00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:53.925
We're just not gonna understand that fully.

156
00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:56.295
So top down theology.

157
00:06:56.955 --> 00:07:00.255
So when we get stuck, there's gonna be times in,

158
00:07:00.255 --> 00:07:01.695
in our study today,

159
00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:04.895
in our study on our own, we're gonna get stuck.

160
00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:06.015
And so I, I was talking to

161
00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:07.255
with our staff yesterday about this,

162
00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:08.775
and Jimmy Quinn, one of

163
00:07:08.775 --> 00:07:09.895
our staff members, been here a long time.

164
00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:11.575
He said this, they had a panel

165
00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:12.815
one time with college students.

166
00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:14.735
They kind of came to this idea

167
00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:16.775
that top down theology kind of idea too.

168
00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:20.175
But, but when we get stuck, what do we come back to?

169
00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:24.215
So think about this, any theology that makes more of God

170
00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:26.615
and less of me is good theology.

171
00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:30.635
So when we get stuck, there's questions we're like, ah,

172
00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:32.275
I don't know how to answer this.

173
00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:35.115
Or maybe there's two options, or four options or 10 options.

174
00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:38.275
Any theology that makes more of God

175
00:07:38.275 --> 00:07:40.835
and less of me is a good theology.

176
00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:44.895
So when we have to default, when we have to kind

177
00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:46.815
of step back and say, oof, I don't know the answer to

178
00:07:46.815 --> 00:07:50.295
that one, the best case, the best way is just to say, okay,

179
00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:51.415
God, I'm trusting you

180
00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:54.855
and this is what I believe happens here, and,

181
00:07:54.855 --> 00:07:56.375
and that makes more of you than less of me.

182
00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:59.775
So that's, if you get stuck, keep coming back to that idea.

183
00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:01.935
Top down. Alright, so I thought it'd be helpful

184
00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:03.975
to talk about why we even needed a

185
00:08:03.975 --> 00:08:05.055
reformation to begin with.

186
00:08:05.715 --> 00:08:07.175
So when we say reformed,

187
00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:10.015
we don't just necessarily mean specifically a

188
00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:11.695
system of belief.

189
00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:14.775
Why did we need a reformation to begin with?

190
00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:18.385
Well, the Protestant Reformation was a widespread

191
00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:21.585
theological revolt in Europe against the abuses

192
00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:25.145
and totalitarian control of the Roman Catholic Church.

193
00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:30.185
So there were reformers, we say Martin Luther, ZW Lee,

194
00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:31.345
Calvin, many others.

195
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.025
They were protesting various unbiblical practices

196
00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:35.025
of the Catholic church.

197
00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:38.505
And what they were promoting was a return to sound doctrine

198
00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:42.225
to the apostolic doctrine, uh,

199
00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:43.385
that they would reference even

200
00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:44.785
Augustine in the four hundreds.

201
00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:47.185
You'd reference even before that as well.

202
00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:49.185
Uh, but that's what they were seeing.

203
00:08:49.205 --> 00:08:50.185
And so we'll talk a little bit

204
00:08:50.185 --> 00:08:51.105
more about what they were seeing.

205
00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:52.625
But the precipitating event

206
00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.485
of the Protestant Reformation generally considered

207
00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:58.605
to be Luther protesting the church

208
00:08:58.745 --> 00:09:02.805
by posting 95 theses on the door in Wittenberg,

209
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.325
where he listed out all the things

210
00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:06.525
that he saw that were wrong.

211
00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:09.685
And it put him on the, the hit list, really,

212
00:09:10.275 --> 00:09:11.725
from the church at that point.

213
00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:14.245
But that was October 31st, 1517.

214
00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:19.575
So as a background to that, it's important

215
00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:24.135
to understand why they were so, uh, angry, upset about this,

216
00:09:24.135 --> 00:09:28.535
because the Catholic claim of apostolic succession was part

217
00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.375
of the problem where the doctrine says the line

218
00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:33.255
of Roman Catholic popes extends all the way back

219
00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:34.735
to the apostle Peter.

220
00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:38.495
So the current pope they would say is in the apostolic

221
00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:40.055
line from Peter.

222
00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:42.775
And so that makes them, in their minds,

223
00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:44.175
the only true church.

224
00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:49.605
And it gives the pope this preeminence over all churches,

225
00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:52.845
everywhere that he has this line unbroken line.

226
00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:55.085
Even the way he speaks as cathedra is,

227
00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:56.405
is apostolic authority.

228
00:09:57.345 --> 00:09:59.685
And so because of their belief in that,

229
00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:02.885
then Catholics place the teaching of the church

230
00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:04.685
and the tradition teaching

231
00:10:04.685 --> 00:10:06.685
of the church on equal status with scripture.

232
00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:10.005
So it's not scripture by itself as scripture

233
00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:11.925
and tradition scripture and the Pope's

234
00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:13.285
teaching in that sense.

235
00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:16.205
And so that's one of the major differences today, of course.

236
00:10:16.225 --> 00:10:17.765
But it was one of the foundational issues

237
00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:18.845
leading to the reformation.

238
00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:22.635
Now, there was some resistance before Luther,

239
00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:24.955
but they were kind of small, isolated.

240
00:10:25.455 --> 00:10:27.915
It came to a head when Luther posted those

241
00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:29.755
challenge, the authority of the Pope.

242
00:10:30.335 --> 00:10:33.435
And specifically the issue came around the selling

243
00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:36.235
of indulgences where the,

244
00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:40.795
the Roman Catholic Church was selling these indulgences

245
00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:43.795
as a means of releasing people from having to

246
00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:47.355
perform penitence for their sins.

247
00:10:47.895 --> 00:10:51.435
It would also get people out of purgatory faster.

248
00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:54.675
Uh, this is one quote, as soon

249
00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:56.475
as the penny jingles into the money box,

250
00:10:56.575 --> 00:10:58.355
the soul flies out of purgatory.

251
00:10:59.655 --> 00:11:02.035
So they were selling, which Luther's saying,

252
00:11:02.285 --> 00:11:04.515
these church officials are teaching people,

253
00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:06.355
they could literally buy their way into the kingdom

254
00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:09.435
of heaven or buy their way into God's favor or someone else.

255
00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:12.995
And so the, the Pope had deteriorated

256
00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:16.275
into these manmade doctrines,

257
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:19.235
and so he's like, this is wrong.

258
00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:24.115
This is way off. Well, the Roman Catholic Church

259
00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.195
did not heed that call.

260
00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:27.715
They dug in its heels and sought

261
00:11:27.735 --> 00:11:29.995
to silence the reformers, often violently.

262
00:11:32.195 --> 00:11:35.455
And so that's what precipitates begins.

263
00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:38.415
What we know as the Protestant protest,

264
00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:43.685
Protestant reformation at the heart of reformation,

265
00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:44.925
is four basic questions.

266
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:49.865
How is a person saved? Where does religious authority lie?

267
00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:52.905
What is the church and

268
00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:54.725
what is the essence of Christian living?

269
00:11:56.195 --> 00:11:58.055
So that's kind of the genesis of Luther.

270
00:11:58.085 --> 00:12:00.135
He's thinking through these things and he's talking about

271
00:12:00.135 --> 00:12:03.135
that that's what led them to develop what we now know

272
00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:06.895
as the five solas sola being the Latin word for alone.

273
00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:09.495
And so these are the five essential points of doctrine that,

274
00:12:10.165 --> 00:12:13.335
that separate Protestantism from Roman Catholicism.

275
00:12:13.475 --> 00:12:16.295
So they, uh, they resisted the demands.

276
00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:19.215
The Roman Catholic Church resisted the demands to reform.

277
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.535
Uh, and so they, they began telling these ref,

278
00:12:22.635 --> 00:12:25.735
the reformers, saying, you recant or you're going to die.

279
00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:30.155
They called them anathema, cursed in this,

280
00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:34.555
but they didn't recant burned alive at the stake, many

281
00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:37.315
of them to uphold what they saw

282
00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:40.155
as biblical doctrines about salvation

283
00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:44.595
and about these truths of the church and authority.

284
00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:47.955
And so the first one was Solas scriptura scripture alone,

285
00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:52.515
that the bible's the sole authority, not scripture

286
00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:54.955
and tradition scripture on its own.

287
00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:57.435
Uh, everything else is measured by that.

288
00:12:58.685 --> 00:13:00.585
So we, we have that as number one.

289
00:13:00.645 --> 00:13:02.785
Number two, salvation by grace alone,

290
00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:07.585
God's undeserved favor, not by any work we do,

291
00:13:08.295 --> 00:13:13.145
that God is the sole cause of salvation in grace to us.

292
00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:17.665
God's work by His Holy Spirit raise us from death to life,

293
00:13:18.695 --> 00:13:21.545
then soe, which is salvation by faith alone,

294
00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:23.745
that we're justified by faith in Christ alone,

295
00:13:23.745 --> 00:13:24.825
not by the works of the law.

296
00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:28.865
It's faith that is imputing righteousness to us,

297
00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:33.705
that that's the standard that we meet only by faith.

298
00:13:34.325 --> 00:13:35.945
Number four was in Christ alone.

299
00:13:36.045 --> 00:13:39.235
So is Christus as salvation's found in Christ alone.

300
00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:40.475
No one, nothing else can save.

301
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:44.195
And the, uh, you're not saved through the church.

302
00:13:44.215 --> 00:13:47.435
You're saved through Christ. You're saved in some ways.

303
00:13:47.775 --> 00:13:50.355
Um, you're on, you're not saved

304
00:13:50.355 --> 00:13:52.155
unless Christ's redemption is declared.

305
00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:54.475
The gospel's not been declared, if that's not part of it.

306
00:13:55.015 --> 00:13:57.435
Uh, and if faith in his resurrection is not solicited.

307
00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:58.635
So it's in Christ alone.

308
00:13:59.175 --> 00:14:00.635
And then for the glory of God alone.

309
00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:05.275
So de Gloria and salvation's of God has been accomplished

310
00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:07.115
by God for his glory alone.

311
00:14:07.615 --> 00:14:11.155
So our lives magnify him in his presence,

312
00:14:11.155 --> 00:14:13.035
under his authority for his glory.

313
00:14:13.335 --> 00:14:16.635
That's the heart of the Protestant Reformation.

314
00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:18.315
Those five truths.

315
00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:20.115
They're at the heart of it, uh, that the,

316
00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:22.155
they're calling the Roman Catholic Church to return

317
00:14:22.175 --> 00:14:23.315
to biblical teaching.

318
00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:25.955
They didn't see it. So they began starting their own.

319
00:14:26.335 --> 00:14:29.995
And that's what you see happen in Protestant churches coming

320
00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:30.995
about as a result.

321
00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:35.075
Okay? So that's the genesis of this.

322
00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:40.845
Now, in talking about this, I've already had the question,

323
00:14:40.915 --> 00:14:43.565
well, what if somebody just wants to study the Bible?

324
00:14:43.635 --> 00:14:47.365
Like don't, don't tell me all of these things about systems

325
00:14:47.705 --> 00:14:49.245
and why do I need all this stuff?

326
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:51.855
It just seems like it's cluttering things.

327
00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:54.975
Just gimme the Bible. It's all I need. Okay?

328
00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:57.535
It's a great, it's number one in the Solas, right?

329
00:14:59.475 --> 00:15:02.175
And that's okay. The problem is you're gonna come up

330
00:15:02.175 --> 00:15:04.015
with your own system, right?

331
00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:06.935
It's going to come out in some way where you have

332
00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:09.215
to piece together things within the Bible

333
00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:11.295
to understand how they work together.

334
00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:14.295
Now, you don't have to be harsh about it, but,

335
00:15:14.315 --> 00:15:16.535
but the reality is we're going to come up with things

336
00:15:16.725 --> 00:15:19.415
that we have to tie and work together and mesh somehow.

337
00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:22.055
And, and so that's the reality. Yes.

338
00:15:22.575 --> 00:15:25.735
I I we want you to just study the Bible. Absolutely. Great.

339
00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:29.135
The problem is you, you have to figure out

340
00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:30.215
how it works together.

341
00:15:30.435 --> 00:15:32.775
And so that's where we come to these sorts of things.

342
00:15:32.775 --> 00:15:34.895
That's okay, great, let's do it.

343
00:15:34.915 --> 00:15:37.335
But, but let's talk about how to handle it.

344
00:15:39.035 --> 00:15:40.235
I also wanna address this.

345
00:15:40.675 --> 00:15:44.035
I is is this some kind of new revelation?

346
00:15:46.175 --> 00:15:48.835
So there was a heresy back in Jesus' day

347
00:15:49.655 --> 00:15:52.235
and a couple of hundred years after called gnosticism.

348
00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:55.755
And the word agnosis starts

349
00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:58.195
with a gnosis in the Greek means knowledge.

350
00:15:59.535 --> 00:16:01.355
So there was this perspective,

351
00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:02.475
you can read it in the New Testament,

352
00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:05.035
that they're talking about this kind of special revelation

353
00:16:05.035 --> 00:16:07.555
that they're getting special knowledge

354
00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:08.715
that nobody else can have,

355
00:16:10.415 --> 00:16:13.875
and that was trying to elevate themselves above others

356
00:16:14.735 --> 00:16:17.795
in the church, that they got some special revelation from

357
00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:19.275
God, that they, this person over

358
00:16:19.275 --> 00:16:20.355
here, they need to listen to it.

359
00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:22.635
God told me that we shouldn't

360
00:16:23.295 --> 00:16:24.755
eat this or we shouldn't do this.

361
00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:27.435
And so there was this claim for special revelation,

362
00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:30.475
and it was a special knowledge, a secret knowledge

363
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:37.185
that has been asked about this, where like, okay,

364
00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:41.245
I, I don't, I don't see that, and I, I don't read

365
00:16:41.305 --> 00:16:42.445
and I don't see those words.

366
00:16:42.525 --> 00:16:43.925
I don't see those things in the Bible.

367
00:16:44.065 --> 00:16:47.085
And so did you guys get some kind of special revelation?

368
00:16:47.145 --> 00:16:49.685
And this is a super class of Christian,

369
00:16:49.705 --> 00:16:51.085
if you don't understand this,

370
00:16:51.085 --> 00:16:53.605
you're a lesser believer if you're not getting this all

371
00:16:53.845 --> 00:16:56.365
together, like, is this some kind of n gnosticism?

372
00:16:56.545 --> 00:16:57.765
Is that what we're talking about here?

373
00:16:59.195 --> 00:17:00.485
Well, that can breed arrogance

374
00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:07.225
and it can breed defeatism on the other side who don't

375
00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:08.905
mesh line up fully.

376
00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.775
And so I want to be clear that this is not, that

377
00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:18.515
this is simply an effort to read God's word,

378
00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:23.525
understand it, its implications, try

379
00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:27.285
to answer the questions, and that leads to statements, leads

380
00:17:27.305 --> 00:17:29.565
to creeds, it leads to beliefs.

381
00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:33.955
Yeah. But this is not something that you have to get

382
00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:36.515
to some second level of heaven to figure out.

383
00:17:36.695 --> 00:17:39.035
And if you're not there, then you're some lesser Chris.

384
00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:41.395
No, that's not the case. All

385
00:17:42.165 --> 00:17:43.805
of us are still growing in our

386
00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:45.045
ability to understand these things.

387
00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:49.005
We should all walk humbly into these realities

388
00:17:49.975 --> 00:17:52.315
and never feel like we have the whole handle on this

389
00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.675
or the corner of the market on this.

390
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.225
So don't think of it as some levels of,

391
00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:01.425
of spirituality based on how much you know

392
00:18:01.425 --> 00:18:02.625
and how well you understand these things.

393
00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:04.865
That's not true at all. We're all in process.

394
00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:11.065
So what then is reformed theology?

395
00:18:12.295 --> 00:18:15.625
Well, as I've already said, broadly speaking, it's

396
00:18:16.285 --> 00:18:17.305
any system of belief

397
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:19.465
that traces its roots back to the reformation.

398
00:18:21.785 --> 00:18:24.685
So in essence, we're all, if we're not Catholics,

399
00:18:25.215 --> 00:18:27.485
we're all reformed in that sense.

400
00:18:30.385 --> 00:18:33.005
Of course, they, they traced their beliefs back

401
00:18:33.005 --> 00:18:34.125
to scripture, right?

402
00:18:34.415 --> 00:18:37.405
Solas scriptura. So we're not saying that coming

403
00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:39.565
with a new system, they're, they're tracing back

404
00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:42.765
to the apostolic doctrine through people like Augustine

405
00:18:42.765 --> 00:18:45.245
and the INE Creed and other places that tried to articulate

406
00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:46.845
what the apostles were teaching.

407
00:18:48.235 --> 00:18:49.885
It's not new. They're just trying to

408
00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:54.405
rere remind everybody about what we had at

409
00:18:54.405 --> 00:18:56.365
that time 1500 years ago.

410
00:18:56.995 --> 00:19:00.285
This is what we believe, right? As a church, as Christians.

411
00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:04.845
So when we think of though, specifically, of course,

412
00:19:04.865 --> 00:19:08.205
that's generically ref reformation

413
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:12.085
generally, and more specifically about

414
00:19:12.155 --> 00:19:15.285
what we typically say, capital R reform theology holds

415
00:19:15.285 --> 00:19:18.045
to the authority of scripture, the sovereignty of God,

416
00:19:19.165 --> 00:19:20.405
salvation by grace through Christ,

417
00:19:21.225 --> 00:19:23.485
and the necessity of evangelism.

418
00:19:23.975 --> 00:19:26.165
Again, I'm gonna try to deal with some of the questions

419
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.805
that come up with this, but sometimes

420
00:19:27.805 --> 00:19:28.925
called covenant theology.

421
00:19:29.305 --> 00:19:31.445
It emphasizes the covenant God made with Adam,

422
00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:34.165
and then the covenants you see throughout the Old Testament

423
00:19:34.165 --> 00:19:36.125
all the way until the new covenant, which came

424
00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:37.125
through Jesus Christ.

425
00:19:37.665 --> 00:19:39.165
So it's, it's typically called that.

426
00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:41.285
And there's no dispensations, no distributions.

427
00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:43.205
It's it's covenant throughout

428
00:19:43.205 --> 00:19:47.045
that there's one covenant really, that God has, has strung

429
00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:49.765
through the red, uh, you could call it the scarlet thread,

430
00:19:50.225 --> 00:19:52.405
all the way back from Adam, all the way

431
00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:55.365
through the Old Testament into the new covenant in Jesus.

432
00:19:56.185 --> 00:19:57.965
So walk through those again, authority of scripture

433
00:19:58.355 --> 00:20:00.725
that the Bible is the inspired, authoritative word of God.

434
00:20:00.755 --> 00:20:02.565
It's sufficient in all matters of faith

435
00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:05.765
and practice, uh, the sovereignty of God.

436
00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:08.405
That God has absolute control over all creation,

437
00:20:09.925 --> 00:20:12.935
that he has foreordained, we'll talk about that.

438
00:20:13.115 --> 00:20:16.055
All events, he's never frustrated by circumstances.

439
00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:18.895
He's not open to like just figuring out

440
00:20:18.895 --> 00:20:20.015
what's happening later.

441
00:20:20.015 --> 00:20:21.775
And he's responding to it as it happens.

442
00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:23.775
That's not what we believe about God.

443
00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:26.935
Uh, it does not limit the will of the creature,

444
00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:29.095
nor does it make God the author of sin.

445
00:20:29.555 --> 00:20:32.415
So I would say that there's a measure of question

446
00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:33.415
that will come up with that,

447
00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:34.975
but that's part of God's sovereignty,

448
00:20:34.975 --> 00:20:36.695
is there's a mystery of how it works.

449
00:20:36.755 --> 00:20:38.615
But we'll talk about it a little bit later.

450
00:20:39.315 --> 00:20:40.415
Uh, salvation by grace.

451
00:20:41.235 --> 00:20:44.895
So you can see that there's, um, God in his grace

452
00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:46.855
and mercy chosen to redeem a people to himself.

453
00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:51.285
So that is what we get to what we typically think.

454
00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:54.125
Those other ones, most Christians would believe the

455
00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:56.045
authority of scripture, most Christians would say

456
00:20:56.045 --> 00:20:57.245
some form of sovereignty of God.

457
00:20:57.955 --> 00:20:59.845
This is where the systems begin to

458
00:21:00.545 --> 00:21:03.485
differ a little bit salvation by grace specifically,

459
00:21:03.485 --> 00:21:05.685
and this is what you typically hear of five points

460
00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:07.965
and whatever you want to call it there,

461
00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:10.965
but I referenced a lot of them.

462
00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:13.085
Sunday. Didn't say specifically the names of those

463
00:21:13.085 --> 00:21:16.525
because it's, it's just part of what we teach in there.

464
00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:20.885
But I do wanna articulate what, what some would say, uh,

465
00:21:20.895 --> 00:21:24.565
would be reform theology, that unconditional election

466
00:21:25.155 --> 00:21:26.885
that God from Eaternity past has chosen

467
00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:28.045
to save a great multitude

468
00:21:28.045 --> 00:21:29.325
of sinners, which no man can number.

469
00:21:29.325 --> 00:21:31.485
That's going back to the covenant with Abraham.

470
00:21:32.025 --> 00:21:34.205
But it's God from Eaternity past chosen

471
00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:36.085
to save limited atonement,

472
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.125
particular redemption is another way to put that,

473
00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:40.205
that Christ took the judgment for the sin

474
00:21:40.205 --> 00:21:42.365
of the elect upon himself, paid

475
00:21:42.365 --> 00:21:43.525
for their lives with his death.

476
00:21:44.065 --> 00:21:46.445
Uh, he didn't make salvation just possible.

477
00:21:46.585 --> 00:21:50.005
He actually obtained salvation for those that he had chosen.

478
00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:51.965
So that's, uh, a question.

479
00:21:51.975 --> 00:21:54.245
We'll get to that total depravity man.

480
00:21:54.245 --> 00:21:56.405
We're, we're helpless, we're sinners.

481
00:21:56.785 --> 00:21:59.965
And that has so comprehensively affected us

482
00:22:00.675 --> 00:22:02.125
that we can't please God,

483
00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:04.045
and we can't work our way out of it.

484
00:22:04.045 --> 00:22:06.005
We're not gonna naturally seek to know God.

485
00:22:06.005 --> 00:22:09.645
We're not gonna want to have anything to do with God

486
00:22:09.645 --> 00:22:11.165
unless God would prompt us

487
00:22:11.585 --> 00:22:15.205
and change something in us to then turn us towards him,

488
00:22:15.965 --> 00:22:18.965
irresistible grace, that God is

489
00:22:20.335 --> 00:22:22.315
in our natural state by ourselves.

490
00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:23.395
We resist God,

491
00:22:23.415 --> 00:22:27.405
but the grace of God working in our heart, we,

492
00:22:27.465 --> 00:22:31.005
we then desire what he wants us to desire.

493
00:22:31.025 --> 00:22:32.125
We previously resisted

494
00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:35.365
that God does not fail in saving his people.

495
00:22:36.495 --> 00:22:38.155
And then perseverance of the saints common,

496
00:22:38.895 --> 00:22:41.435
you might have heard it said once saved, always saved.

497
00:22:41.515 --> 00:22:43.515
I don't really like that phrase, but perseverance

498
00:22:43.515 --> 00:22:45.155
of the saints, that God protects his

499
00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:46.195
saints from falling away.

500
00:22:46.555 --> 00:22:49.115
Salvation is eternal. And we saw why

501
00:22:49.275 --> 00:22:51.235
'cause the ceiling of the Holy Spirit, that sort of thing

502
00:22:51.255 --> 00:22:54.155
as we go, okay?

503
00:22:54.155 --> 00:22:57.235
So that's, that's a quick summary of what

504
00:22:57.995 --> 00:22:59.595
theology is typically known as.

505
00:23:01.455 --> 00:23:04.925
What do others believe? And also, if,

506
00:23:04.945 --> 00:23:08.165
if I don't line up fully with those five, which again,

507
00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:12.045
this is a system, this is not the gospel,

508
00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:14.665
this is a system of explaining something.

509
00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:18.665
It's a bucket that we place things in to try

510
00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:20.105
to hold it together, right?

511
00:23:21.685 --> 00:23:23.145
But if I don't line up with all that,

512
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.825
am I not a Christian like that's legitimately been asked?

513
00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:31.625
Don't hear us say that. What we're having here is an

514
00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:33.425
intramural debate, right?

515
00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:36.265
So we're differing on some of the, the nuances

516
00:23:36.265 --> 00:23:39.825
and some of the things that we see it work out implications.

517
00:23:40.725 --> 00:23:43.185
But the big rocks, remember

518
00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:46.405
the big rocks are the salvific things.

519
00:23:47.185 --> 00:23:49.485
Now this talks about salvation a lot, doesn't it?

520
00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:52.405
So there's a bit of this sort of, what is it?

521
00:23:52.505 --> 00:23:54.245
Big rock, small rock, sand.

522
00:23:54.385 --> 00:23:56.285
It, it does do some of those things,

523
00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:59.715
but I don't want you to hear us say that you,

524
00:24:00.175 --> 00:24:02.955
if you're not agreeing with all five of those things,

525
00:24:02.955 --> 00:24:03.995
that you're not a Christian.

526
00:24:03.995 --> 00:24:06.355
Because there's leaders in our church all over the place.

527
00:24:06.355 --> 00:24:07.875
There's church members all over the place

528
00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:09.555
that don't line up with all five of those things.

529
00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:15.215
So don't hear that. Okay? So what do others believe?

530
00:24:15.925 --> 00:24:17.535
What, where does, where do other people stand

531
00:24:17.635 --> 00:24:18.695
on those, those things?

532
00:24:20.485 --> 00:24:24.695
Well, going back to this development of the doctrine,

533
00:24:25.985 --> 00:24:30.515
there was a man named Pelagius who came

534
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:33.755
to persuade people of their own free will

535
00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:34.835
to live a Christian life.

536
00:24:35.025 --> 00:24:37.155
Like he looked at the commandments God had given

537
00:24:37.155 --> 00:24:38.555
and said, how could it be just for God

538
00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:39.755
to give a commandment that we couldn't keep?

539
00:24:42.215 --> 00:24:43.275
The law is righteous.

540
00:24:43.495 --> 00:24:45.635
God is righteous, the freedom to keep the commandment so,

541
00:24:45.655 --> 00:24:47.155
so clearly, that's gotta be the way.

542
00:24:48.345 --> 00:24:49.635
Well, Augustine shows up

543
00:24:49.635 --> 00:24:50.675
and Augustine says, no,

544
00:24:50.915 --> 00:24:52.355
actually the law is righteous

545
00:24:52.385 --> 00:24:53.915
expresses what we're commanded to do.

546
00:24:54.455 --> 00:24:58.175
We can't do it though because of sin. He's given.

547
00:24:58.205 --> 00:24:59.415
It's good, but we can't do it.

548
00:24:59.425 --> 00:25:01.455
Grace is the only reason we're able to obey the law.

549
00:25:03.405 --> 00:25:05.625
And so God gave us the law to expose us

550
00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:06.625
that we can't keep it.

551
00:25:07.995 --> 00:25:10.695
And so we need him. We need his grace to follow it.

552
00:25:10.695 --> 00:25:12.255
We need grace. Our inability is

553
00:25:12.255 --> 00:25:13.415
not just physical, it's moral.

554
00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:17.595
And so then they came to a council

555
00:25:17.595 --> 00:25:22.435
that de declared thatas was not right in his view.

556
00:25:24.535 --> 00:25:26.835
If by nature none of us can do what God calls us to do,

557
00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:27.995
grace is necessary.

558
00:25:28.695 --> 00:25:30.195
Who gives grace? God does.

559
00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:33.095
And only he controls and dispenses that.

560
00:25:34.235 --> 00:25:37.375
So that was part of the development of this, uh, this,

561
00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:41.935
this belief system that came from Augustine into the creeds.

562
00:25:41.955 --> 00:25:44.655
And then you see it show up again with the reformation.

563
00:25:45.555 --> 00:25:47.655
But here's where it's kind of, there's,

564
00:25:47.655 --> 00:25:49.335
it's called semi pianism.

565
00:25:50.125 --> 00:25:52.455
It's a bit of an alternative.

566
00:25:52.725 --> 00:25:53.855
It's similar to what it was,

567
00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:55.495
and it tries to mediate some things.

568
00:25:55.595 --> 00:25:59.655
But what it says is that God's grace comes to us

569
00:25:59.835 --> 00:26:03.965
to strengthen a weak will, not

570
00:26:03.965 --> 00:26:05.325
to give it the ability to do what is right.

571
00:26:07.915 --> 00:26:11.535
So the question then is, is our will just weak

572
00:26:12.395 --> 00:26:13.455
in our sin state?

573
00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:18.265
Or are we dead and unable to do anything?

574
00:26:19.695 --> 00:26:22.505
Well, the way we read that is the Bible says we're dead in

575
00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:23.585
our trespasses and sins.

576
00:26:23.585 --> 00:26:26.905
We have no ability. No one seeks God, no one is righteous.

577
00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.905
And so we'd even push back on that a little bit,

578
00:26:29.905 --> 00:26:32.865
that the Bible seems to indicate that we are unable

579
00:26:33.995 --> 00:26:35.415
in ourselves in any way

580
00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:39.255
unless God completely changes us from death to life

581
00:26:39.715 --> 00:26:42.375
to actually seek to do what is right in God's eyes.

582
00:26:44.905 --> 00:26:47.005
So I wanna go back through those five things

583
00:26:47.025 --> 00:26:49.085
and kind of talk about where people would land

584
00:26:49.185 --> 00:26:50.405
on other things there.

585
00:26:51.465 --> 00:26:54.805
Um, so on their own, humans can do nothing good.

586
00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:57.765
That's that one of that we're totally depraved, kind

587
00:26:57.765 --> 00:26:59.325
of consistently dead in that

588
00:26:59.905 --> 00:27:01.725
no one naturally desires to seek Christ.

589
00:27:02.315 --> 00:27:04.285
Most people agree in some form of that.

590
00:27:04.485 --> 00:27:06.765
Although there is that bit of just like, we're just weak.

591
00:27:06.815 --> 00:27:10.405
We're not fully dead. Well, no, we're, we're dead.

592
00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:13.645
So then that, there's the view that,

593
00:27:13.645 --> 00:27:15.765
that God looked ahead from eternity past

594
00:27:15.825 --> 00:27:18.605
and chose those who would choose him, that he for knew

595
00:27:18.605 --> 00:27:20.725
and saw ahead, that people would choose him,

596
00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:21.805
and that's who he chose.

597
00:27:22.665 --> 00:27:24.605
That's a little bit different way of seeing it,

598
00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:26.925
rather than unconditional election, that God

599
00:27:27.665 --> 00:27:30.165
is not choosing based on anything in that person

600
00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:31.965
or anything they would do.

601
00:27:33.505 --> 00:27:35.925
The limited atonement one, the particular redemption one,

602
00:27:36.395 --> 00:27:39.605
there's some different different views on that which say

603
00:27:39.605 --> 00:27:41.085
that Jesus dies for everyone,

604
00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:44.365
but his death only redeems believers, uh,

605
00:27:44.365 --> 00:27:46.885
that he laid down his life for everyone

606
00:27:46.945 --> 00:27:49.005
and then only gets applied to some.

607
00:27:49.425 --> 00:27:51.485
So there's some different opinions

608
00:27:51.485 --> 00:27:52.605
about the atonement there.

609
00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:55.925
Uh, some would believe that you can choose

610
00:27:55.945 --> 00:27:58.045
to reject God's attempt to save them.

611
00:27:58.865 --> 00:28:01.205
So the irresistible grace that God's gonna save, those

612
00:28:01.205 --> 00:28:03.325
who he's gonna save, he calls, he's gonna save them.

613
00:28:03.585 --> 00:28:06.085
Others would say he calls and and they can resist that.

614
00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:09.725
And they can choose not to be saved in that sense.

615
00:28:10.905 --> 00:28:13.245
And then there's the, like I said, perseverance

616
00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:15.605
of the saints that once saved, always saved idea

617
00:28:15.635 --> 00:28:18.365
that if someone is a believer sealed by the Holy Spirit,

618
00:28:18.365 --> 00:28:20.005
they'll persevere in faith until the end.

619
00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:21.845
Some people believe that you can reject your

620
00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:23.125
salvation and you can lose it.

621
00:28:24.575 --> 00:28:28.395
So you can see there's these kind of, it turns into camps.

622
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.835
But what I hope you see is that there actually is a lot of

623
00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:36.395
kind of meshing and crossing over that.

624
00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:39.795
There is some things that we've got questions there.

625
00:28:39.795 --> 00:28:41.875
We've got some, some things that we need

626
00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:43.195
to discern out there.

627
00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:44.675
That's, it's part of it.

628
00:28:45.415 --> 00:28:47.275
But it's important because from whatever

629
00:28:48.315 --> 00:28:50.395
doctrine you choose, a lot

630
00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:51.475
of other doctrines flow from that.

631
00:28:52.715 --> 00:28:55.455
And a lot of things are implications from that

632
00:28:56.115 --> 00:28:57.535
and it shapes your worldview.

633
00:28:58.635 --> 00:29:01.925
But again, there are well-informed,

634
00:29:02.155 --> 00:29:04.845
true faithful Christians on all on

635
00:29:04.845 --> 00:29:06.005
both sides of that debate.

636
00:29:08.245 --> 00:29:11.625
For example, Methodists would lean more on that other side

637
00:29:11.645 --> 00:29:16.225
of things, uh, very much more the um, kind

638
00:29:16.225 --> 00:29:17.505
of helping grace.

639
00:29:17.615 --> 00:29:20.465
They call it that God can call,

640
00:29:20.485 --> 00:29:21.825
but you can choose to reject it.

641
00:29:21.825 --> 00:29:22.865
You can lose your salvation.

642
00:29:22.965 --> 00:29:24.425
Not all Methodists believe that either,

643
00:29:24.925 --> 00:29:27.145
but that's part of some of those that you can get there.

644
00:29:27.145 --> 00:29:29.825
Presbyterians tend to be more reformed in that.

645
00:29:29.885 --> 00:29:31.145
But, but we'd look at that

646
00:29:31.145 --> 00:29:32.625
and say, are your big rocks, right?

647
00:29:34.015 --> 00:29:36.355
We true Christians. And we can walk together in some

648
00:29:36.355 --> 00:29:37.555
of there, there's gonna be questions and some things.

649
00:29:37.555 --> 00:29:40.155
That's why maybe there's some differences of denominations.

650
00:29:40.255 --> 00:29:44.125
But we can get there to, uh, to see that man,

651
00:29:44.125 --> 00:29:45.165
we're brothers and sisters in Christ.

652
00:29:45.215 --> 00:29:49.125
Let's, let's walk together in some ways as well. Okay?

653
00:29:49.165 --> 00:29:51.205
I wanna invite Aaron up here. Is tr here yet?

654
00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:52.725
I don't think I saw him yet,

655
00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:54.285
but I wanna invite Aaron to come up here

656
00:29:54.305 --> 00:29:56.605
and we're gonna talk through a couple more questions

657
00:29:57.145 --> 00:29:58.165
as we go here.

658
00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:00.505
There's a lot more,

659
00:30:01.045 --> 00:30:04.975
of course, as he's coming up here.

660
00:30:04.975 --> 00:30:07.175
One I wanna talk first is can we lose our salvation?

661
00:30:07.195 --> 00:30:08.735
So that, that was one of the questions

662
00:30:08.845 --> 00:30:10.015
that there's a debate on.

663
00:30:11.115 --> 00:30:15.935
Um, the common ar argument is that were those who fall away,

664
00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:17.855
not just, they just weren't saved to begin with.

665
00:30:19.435 --> 00:30:21.485
They tasted of it and then they fell away.

666
00:30:22.275 --> 00:30:23.845
It's called the perseverance of the saints.

667
00:30:23.885 --> 00:30:26.845
Preservation of the saints, you might say, once saved,

668
00:30:26.845 --> 00:30:28.445
always saved assurance of salvation.

669
00:30:31.265 --> 00:30:33.125
The evidence of someone being a Christian is

670
00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:34.125
that they persevere until the end.

671
00:30:36.475 --> 00:30:37.855
So we can't be truly sure really

672
00:30:37.905 --> 00:30:40.375
until someone is actually on the other side.

673
00:30:40.395 --> 00:30:43.255
We don't know. But here's what we see scripture wise,

674
00:30:43.325 --> 00:30:46.255
that we get to that, that we can't lose it.

675
00:30:46.255 --> 00:30:47.415
That's what our belief is.

676
00:30:47.435 --> 00:30:49.655
We can't lose it or walk away from it.

677
00:30:49.675 --> 00:30:51.975
Romans eight, those he four knew he predestined

678
00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:54.015
to be conformed to the image of his son.

679
00:30:54.675 --> 00:30:57.455
Um, those he predestined, he called those whom he called,

680
00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:58.695
he justified, justified.

681
00:30:58.775 --> 00:31:00.375
He also glorified Romans eight talks

682
00:31:00.375 --> 00:31:01.735
as if it's already happened.

683
00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:05.195
And then Romans, uh,

684
00:31:05.575 --> 00:31:07.315
or John six, everyone

685
00:31:07.315 --> 00:31:09.075
who my father gives me will come to me.

686
00:31:09.105 --> 00:31:10.755
I'll never turn away anyone who comes to me.

687
00:31:10.915 --> 00:31:12.675
'cause I've come down from heaven to do not my own will,

688
00:31:12.675 --> 00:31:13.675
but the will of whom who sent me.

689
00:31:14.435 --> 00:31:16.275
I should not lose any of those He's given to me.

690
00:31:16.455 --> 00:31:19.915
So Jesus himself is saying that, uh, by the way,

691
00:31:19.995 --> 00:31:21.435
I will never turn away anyone who comes to me.

692
00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:23.475
That's a common question. Like, well, what if somebody wants

693
00:31:23.535 --> 00:31:24.835
to believe if

694
00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:27.395
what if they're not elect, but they wanna be saved?

695
00:31:28.255 --> 00:31:30.435
We would say that they wanna be saved because they are,

696
00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:32.755
because God has changed their heart.

697
00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:35.395
Like I say, I I told you that story on Sunday of the man

698
00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:37.235
who talked to me right before the service on that Sunday.

699
00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:39.875
He said the day before, didn't want anything to do

700
00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:40.875
with Jesus the next day.

701
00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:43.175
I loved him, wanted to be saved.

702
00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:46.405
Nobody convinced, like it wasn't an argument,

703
00:31:46.505 --> 00:31:47.845
it wasn't a good reasonable state.

704
00:31:47.845 --> 00:31:51.125
It was like God totally changed the heart to want.

705
00:31:51.225 --> 00:31:53.765
So I will never turn away anyone who comes to me.

706
00:31:53.765 --> 00:31:56.525
That means anybody who was coming to Jesus genuinely is

707
00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:59.805
being drawn by God in that way.

708
00:32:01.355 --> 00:32:03.815
Uh, so some people believe people can walk away from God,

709
00:32:03.815 --> 00:32:06.135
that you can choose yourself to walk away.

710
00:32:07.455 --> 00:32:09.915
Um, there's, there's scripture one Corinthians three.

711
00:32:09.915 --> 00:32:11.395
If anyone's work is burned up, he'll suffer loss,

712
00:32:11.395 --> 00:32:12.595
though he himself will be saved,

713
00:32:12.655 --> 00:32:13.875
but only as through fire

714
00:32:14.305 --> 00:32:16.675
like somebody might be walking away.

715
00:32:16.675 --> 00:32:18.275
It seems prodigal son story.

716
00:32:19.015 --> 00:32:22.535
And it sure seems like they're falling away.

717
00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:26.885
20 years later, they finally wake up in the pigsty.

718
00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:30.245
The father still loves his son, right?

719
00:32:30.505 --> 00:32:32.245
The parables is his son. He still a son.

720
00:32:32.245 --> 00:32:33.525
He never was not a son.

721
00:32:34.025 --> 00:32:36.445
And he came back and the father received him in that.

722
00:32:37.305 --> 00:32:38.565
But he would be saved through fire.

723
00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.165
He might say some refining purification there.

724
00:32:42.265 --> 00:32:43.285
So there's a question there.

725
00:32:43.285 --> 00:32:44.645
Some people appear to be Christians for a while.

726
00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:46.325
They turn out to be false, sometimes evil.

727
00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:48.165
Jesus himself, Matthew seven says

728
00:32:48.235 --> 00:32:49.445
away from me, I never knew you.

729
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:52.045
Uh, you all know people who you grew up with.

730
00:32:52.315 --> 00:32:53.565
They were solid believers.

731
00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:55.605
You thought in church they were growing and,

732
00:32:55.945 --> 00:32:57.685
and leaders in high school ministry.

733
00:32:57.785 --> 00:33:01.235
And, and then now they're completely abandoned their faith.

734
00:33:01.235 --> 00:33:03.275
They don't. So it seemed like they were,

735
00:33:03.975 --> 00:33:05.835
but then they turned, it turned out to be false,

736
00:33:05.835 --> 00:33:08.435
sometimes evil, and they actually opposed the Lord.

737
00:33:10.025 --> 00:33:12.755
We don't know. We, we can see

738
00:33:12.755 --> 00:33:14.435
that Jesus did say there are people

739
00:33:14.435 --> 00:33:15.755
who will sure seem like it.

740
00:33:15.895 --> 00:33:18.915
And even Mark four, the parable of the sower,

741
00:33:19.695 --> 00:33:20.915
he scatters the seed.

742
00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:22.835
There's four different types of soil.

743
00:33:22.985 --> 00:33:24.635
Only one actually ends up bearing fruit,

744
00:33:24.655 --> 00:33:26.595
but two of them look like they were

745
00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:27.915
bearing fruit for a while.

746
00:33:29.325 --> 00:33:32.825
And so there is some of that that happens too, which again,

747
00:33:32.825 --> 00:33:34.745
why the only reason, the only way we'll know

748
00:33:34.765 --> 00:33:37.585
for sure is someone who perseveres all the way to the end.

749
00:33:38.555 --> 00:33:42.295
And again, how do we know somebody might spend 90 years

750
00:33:42.295 --> 00:33:43.495
of their life run away from Jesus?

751
00:33:43.595 --> 00:33:45.495
And then right on their deathbed,

752
00:33:45.495 --> 00:33:47.575
the Lord reach in their heart and saves 'em.

753
00:33:47.575 --> 00:33:51.355
That happens too. So this is why some of this is like,

754
00:33:51.355 --> 00:33:53.555
all right, we get so hard line on our system that we,

755
00:33:53.575 --> 00:33:56.115
we start to lose the mystery of God working.

756
00:33:56.695 --> 00:33:59.235
We don't wanna lose that. But those are things

757
00:33:59.235 --> 00:34:01.235
that we would say, all right, so how do we handle,

758
00:34:02.215 --> 00:34:04.115
you guys can start with this one.

759
00:34:04.255 --> 00:34:06.915
How do we handle the scriptures that seem to oppose

760
00:34:08.145 --> 00:34:12.155
what we just talked about when we say, Hey, okay, God

761
00:34:12.995 --> 00:34:15.875
elects, um, God preserves.

762
00:34:16.935 --> 00:34:20.875
And you, you look at those kind of reformed doctrines.

763
00:34:21.445 --> 00:34:23.675
There are scriptures that seem to oppose this.

764
00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:25.675
So it says Jesus died for all

765
00:34:25.935 --> 00:34:28.995
or whoever whosoever would come.

766
00:34:29.095 --> 00:34:31.195
How do we, how do we handle those texts?

767
00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:32.635
Because they're there and,

768
00:34:32.735 --> 00:34:34.595
and we don't wanna just like our,

769
00:34:35.505 --> 00:34:38.115
some people in history have done is like literally remove

770
00:34:38.115 --> 00:34:39.875
parts of the Bible that they didn't agree with.

771
00:34:40.245 --> 00:34:41.715
We're not doing that. So

772
00:34:41.735 --> 00:34:43.395
how do we handle those types of scripture?

773
00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:47.515
Yeah, that's a great question. Excuse me.

774
00:34:47.935 --> 00:34:50.635
The, uh, context of the passage is,

775
00:34:51.495 --> 00:34:53.155
is the most important thing there.

776
00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:57.635
Uh, and looking at the word all,

777
00:34:57.655 --> 00:35:00.075
or whoever, whosoever, what's the meaning

778
00:35:00.075 --> 00:35:01.195
behind those words?

779
00:35:02.895 --> 00:35:06.795
Uh, if Jesus died for all, does that mean

780
00:35:06.795 --> 00:35:08.675
that all are going to be saved?

781
00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:14.075
Uh, we know that's not true. Not all people are saved.

782
00:35:14.295 --> 00:35:15.635
So what does all mean?

783
00:35:15.775 --> 00:35:18.275
We have to figure out what all means in the context

784
00:35:18.535 --> 00:35:21.675
of the passage or whosoever believes

785
00:35:22.005 --> 00:35:23.595
shall be saved.

786
00:35:24.295 --> 00:35:27.555
What's the whosoever? Who's the whosoever? Is that everyone?

787
00:35:27.655 --> 00:35:31.035
Is that a small group? Is that an elect group?

788
00:35:31.815 --> 00:35:36.515
So I think immediate context is, uh, important with, um,

789
00:35:37.315 --> 00:35:38.765
deciphering those verses.

790
00:35:38.825 --> 00:35:41.365
You also have to look at the bigger picture of scripture

791
00:35:41.465 --> 00:35:44.885
and the theological framework that we're talking about,

792
00:35:44.945 --> 00:35:48.565
and how do these fit into that framework that we know

793
00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:53.325
that the totality of scripture is building for us.

794
00:35:54.265 --> 00:35:56.645
And we never want to take a just one verse

795
00:35:56.745 --> 00:35:58.485
and make a, you know,

796
00:35:58.485 --> 00:36:00.685
take a theological stand on just one verse.

797
00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:04.485
But how does that fit into the larger picture of scripture?

798
00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:07.845
So a couple of things there that I think of immediately.

799
00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:13.685
Anything, yeah, there's, there's a couple scriptures

800
00:36:13.915 --> 00:36:17.805
that would say, John three 16, the whoever, um,

801
00:36:18.545 --> 00:36:22.365
you see whosoever, you see the term all a number of times.

802
00:36:23.235 --> 00:36:25.245
It's almost always speaking of everyone in a group,

803
00:36:25.525 --> 00:36:26.965
a class, or a category.

804
00:36:27.465 --> 00:36:29.565
So think of when all of Jerusalem came out

805
00:36:29.565 --> 00:36:30.565
to see John the Baptist,

806
00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:34.715
every person in Jerusalem.

807
00:36:36.085 --> 00:36:38.065
It was implying there of course,

808
00:36:38.175 --> 00:36:40.665
that it was talking about all

809
00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:41.825
different kinds of people came.

810
00:36:41.925 --> 00:36:43.065
Not every human being came.

811
00:36:43.525 --> 00:36:46.185
So you see all there even means a subset

812
00:36:46.445 --> 00:36:47.985
of a whole group, right?

813
00:36:48.565 --> 00:36:49.745
So that's where you have to discern.

814
00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:51.505
That's why the hard part is you have to discern out

815
00:36:51.505 --> 00:36:52.945
what is he saying there?

816
00:36:53.645 --> 00:36:55.505
In, in all the cases that all

817
00:36:55.505 --> 00:36:57.105
that the father gives me shall come to me.

818
00:36:57.565 --> 00:36:59.785
The one who comes to me, I shall not cast out John six.

819
00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:03.265
Um, he desire. Now this is a question.

820
00:37:03.265 --> 00:37:05.545
First Timothy two, he desires all men to be saved

821
00:37:05.545 --> 00:37:06.785
and come to the knowledge of the truth.

822
00:37:07.775 --> 00:37:11.345
Same, same kind of idea. All, okay, what does that mean?

823
00:37:11.365 --> 00:37:12.945
And I know some people might say,

824
00:37:12.945 --> 00:37:14.665
were you playing semantic games there, man?

825
00:37:14.975 --> 00:37:16.385
Like, no, we're just trying to interpret

826
00:37:17.055 --> 00:37:18.425
what the scripture is saying

827
00:37:18.425 --> 00:37:21.065
because again, I just said, all came out,

828
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:23.305
every person in Jerusalem came out to see John the Baptist.

829
00:37:24.085 --> 00:37:26.905
No. So we know all doesn't mean every person there.

830
00:37:26.925 --> 00:37:28.745
So we have to interpret, understand

831
00:37:29.415 --> 00:37:31.105
what the scripture's talking about.

832
00:37:31.725 --> 00:37:34.185
So really there's three ways you can understand.

833
00:37:34.215 --> 00:37:39.025
There's one is universalism, that all people will be saved.

834
00:37:39.745 --> 00:37:43.355
Well, we don't believe that that's a false belief.

835
00:37:43.355 --> 00:37:47.605
The Bible's clear. Second means

836
00:37:48.275 --> 00:37:49.725
then, then there's two other options.

837
00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:50.885
There's the reference

838
00:37:50.885 --> 00:37:53.685
to all means every person can accept Christ if they will

839
00:37:53.685 --> 00:37:54.685
just choose to do so.

840
00:37:55.845 --> 00:37:58.855
Okay, well that's one of the options We already saw that

841
00:37:58.855 --> 00:38:00.855
that's one way people understand that.

842
00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:02.775
But there's also the scriptures then that would indicate

843
00:38:02.805 --> 00:38:06.905
that God is the one who ordains and God is the one who calls

844
00:38:06.905 --> 00:38:08.385
and God is the one who changes hearts.

845
00:38:08.765 --> 00:38:10.145
So we have to deal with that tension.

846
00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:11.665
Then the third option is

847
00:38:11.665 --> 00:38:14.065
that God is saying all meaning the elect, those

848
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:16.105
who he has chosen to save.

849
00:38:16.245 --> 00:38:18.945
And so then there's questions still, but,

850
00:38:18.945 --> 00:38:21.265
but you can see how there's, that's how it comes out.

851
00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:25.465
This systems begin to diverge in those kind of things.

852
00:38:26.495 --> 00:38:29.515
So these passages do not suggest Christ atonement is

853
00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:31.195
for all persons without exception,

854
00:38:31.215 --> 00:38:33.115
but for all people without distinction,

855
00:38:33.735 --> 00:38:35.140
that's at least what we know, know.

856
00:38:35.205 --> 00:38:37.605
'cause we look at revelation, every tribe, tongue

857
00:38:37.605 --> 00:38:38.605
and nation represented.

858
00:38:38.905 --> 00:38:41.045
So his atonement was not just for the Jews,

859
00:38:42.025 --> 00:38:44.725
his atonement was for gentiles, all people,

860
00:38:44.785 --> 00:38:46.005
all languages, all nations.

861
00:38:46.315 --> 00:38:48.925
Someone will be there. We see in Revelation over and again,

862
00:38:49.025 --> 00:38:51.085
Say that one more time, John. Say that without

863
00:38:51.665 --> 00:38:55.165
Christ, atonement is for all persons with, it's not okay.

864
00:38:55.515 --> 00:38:58.445
It's not for all persons without exception,

865
00:38:58.445 --> 00:38:59.565
which would be universalism.

866
00:39:00.275 --> 00:39:02.245
It's for all people without distinction.

867
00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:04.385
Meaning you don't earn it.

868
00:39:04.385 --> 00:39:07.545
There's classes, people get Jews, Gentiles like no,

869
00:39:07.575 --> 00:39:08.625
it's, it's humans.

870
00:39:10.345 --> 00:39:14.535
Christ saves, but not all persons without exception.

871
00:39:15.085 --> 00:39:16.895
Okay, so let's, let's think of this.

872
00:39:17.995 --> 00:39:19.175
Is it really that black and white?

873
00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:22.775
So if we're thinking about systems reform, non-REM,

874
00:39:22.975 --> 00:39:26.615
whatever, is it really this black and white?

875
00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:29.855
Like can we be hard line about this stuff?

876
00:39:29.875 --> 00:39:32.255
Can we be kind of, yeah, well this is what we need

877
00:39:32.255 --> 00:39:33.655
to believe and everybody needs to believe this.

878
00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:35.295
Can we be that way? Is it really?

879
00:39:35.525 --> 00:39:38.625
Well, I think there is, there is one way

880
00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:40.065
that we are saved, right?

881
00:39:40.485 --> 00:39:43.065
Is that way perfectly explained in any human words?

882
00:39:43.425 --> 00:39:45.065
I think we, we'd say no, right?

883
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:49.225
So that we're continuing to, to search scripture.

884
00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:51.825
It's the idea of one of the, that we're always,

885
00:39:51.915 --> 00:39:53.145
we're always reforming part

886
00:39:53.145 --> 00:39:56.025
of reform theology is we're continuing to see what

887
00:39:56.945 --> 00:39:59.025
scripture says and,

888
00:39:59.205 --> 00:40:01.865
and let scripture interpret scripture that there is a,

889
00:40:02.115 --> 00:40:04.505
there is clearly a yes and a no, a black and a white.

890
00:40:04.885 --> 00:40:06.905
Now, can we perfectly put it into words in,

891
00:40:06.925 --> 00:40:11.385
in five categories or five or, or four or six or 17?

892
00:40:12.205 --> 00:40:14.545
Um, but there's a way in which God works

893
00:40:14.765 --> 00:40:16.825
and there are scriptures that are very clear

894
00:40:17.605 --> 00:40:19.465
and there are some that are less clear.

895
00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:22.345
And so we were, that's kinda what we use the totality

896
00:40:22.345 --> 00:40:25.825
of those to help us understand as best we can, uh,

897
00:40:26.355 --> 00:40:27.585
God's work in salvation.

898
00:40:30.015 --> 00:40:33.235
So I've gotten this question in this week,

899
00:40:33.295 --> 00:40:34.715
but I've also heard this question a number

900
00:40:34.715 --> 00:40:35.755
of times from other people.

901
00:40:37.255 --> 00:40:38.315
So somebody's reading the Bible,

902
00:40:38.315 --> 00:40:40.075
they don't really understand it, they can't get there.

903
00:40:40.455 --> 00:40:41.515
Having trouble with some

904
00:40:41.515 --> 00:40:42.955
of the Old Testament stuff seems harsh.

905
00:40:44.905 --> 00:40:46.835
They, they've, they've grown up in the church,

906
00:40:46.905 --> 00:40:49.235
believe like, okay, resurrection.

907
00:40:49.235 --> 00:40:50.835
Like, it's hard to wrap my mind around that.

908
00:40:51.175 --> 00:40:52.715
No evidence for it in there. Okay?

909
00:40:53.525 --> 00:40:56.815
But like I want to believe,

910
00:40:58.725 --> 00:41:00.305
but so much doesn't make sense.

911
00:41:02.075 --> 00:41:05.805
And I'm wondering if the reason is because I'm not chosen.

912
00:41:06.935 --> 00:41:10.345
Like I've had somebody ask me that question to my face and,

913
00:41:10.345 --> 00:41:14.505
and they've wrestled with that reality of I wanna believe,

914
00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:17.265
but I just don't, I I just can't get, I can't get there.

915
00:41:18.165 --> 00:41:19.385
It seems like I can't get there.

916
00:41:20.315 --> 00:41:21.815
How would you respond to somebody like that?

917
00:41:23.935 --> 00:41:26.395
Am I, am I elect right?

918
00:41:26.635 --> 00:41:27.915
Somebody's wrestling with that question

919
00:41:28.475 --> 00:41:29.835
'cause they don't really feel saved.

920
00:41:30.335 --> 00:41:31.335
How would you answer that?

921
00:41:33.695 --> 00:41:34.785
Yeah, that's a tough one.

922
00:41:34.965 --> 00:41:39.385
Uh, I think just by the nature of

923
00:41:40.135 --> 00:41:41.465
wrestling with those things,

924
00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:43.305
I could tell God is working on your heart

925
00:41:44.205 --> 00:41:48.465
and working in your mind and, and maybe it's this process,

926
00:41:48.725 --> 00:41:53.545
but he's, he's changing your heart, uh, to believe.

927
00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:57.385
And um, sometimes it happens just like that for people

928
00:41:57.445 --> 00:42:00.145
and sometimes it happens, you know, over time.

929
00:42:00.325 --> 00:42:02.745
But, um, I would say that that's evidence

930
00:42:02.745 --> 00:42:04.145
that God's working in your life.

931
00:42:05.085 --> 00:42:07.505
Um, it doesn't mean necessarily that,

932
00:42:07.615 --> 00:42:09.385
that you will believe eventually.

933
00:42:09.685 --> 00:42:11.065
We don't know that for sure.

934
00:42:11.205 --> 00:42:14.905
But, uh, I would say that's evidence that God is at work.

935
00:42:16.135 --> 00:42:18.705
Yeah. And similarly, even the, even the conviction

936
00:42:18.705 --> 00:42:21.385
of sin is a work of the Holy Spirit in your life.

937
00:42:21.445 --> 00:42:24.985
And so encouraging people to, to lean into that even,

938
00:42:25.085 --> 00:42:28.785
and then, and to the desire, we would say that the desire

939
00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:30.985
to seek after God comes from the work

940
00:42:30.985 --> 00:42:32.225
of the Holy Spirit in your life.

941
00:42:32.285 --> 00:42:35.145
So it may be that he hasn't finished that good work

942
00:42:35.145 --> 00:42:37.585
that he started, but he started a good work.

943
00:42:38.165 --> 00:42:40.945
Um, and we, nobody can know who's elected

944
00:42:40.945 --> 00:42:42.105
and who's not, except for those

945
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.745
who have ultimately professed their faith in Christ.

946
00:42:45.285 --> 00:42:47.985
Um, we would say, yes, that person is iSelect

947
00:42:48.145 --> 00:42:49.905
'cause we've seen the fulfillment of that work,

948
00:42:49.965 --> 00:42:52.225
but up until that point, there's no way to know.

949
00:42:53.255 --> 00:42:54.745
Yeah. And there's the, one

950
00:42:54.745 --> 00:42:56.825
of my favorite stories is when the, the man comes

951
00:42:56.825 --> 00:42:58.345
to Jesus says, Hey, my,

952
00:42:58.365 --> 00:42:59.785
my daughter's sick, can you heal her?

953
00:43:00.725 --> 00:43:02.505
And he's like, yeah, I can heal her if you believe.

954
00:43:03.565 --> 00:43:06.375
He's like, whew, I believe to help my unbelief.

955
00:43:07.595 --> 00:43:11.015
So he's of this wrestling moment of, yeah, I,

956
00:43:11.175 --> 00:43:15.255
I know you can, but there's times I really doubt that too.

957
00:43:15.655 --> 00:43:17.695
I don't really know if I'm all in on believing that.

958
00:43:17.755 --> 00:43:19.855
And so that gives me a little solace at times for

959
00:43:19.855 --> 00:43:23.255
that same spirit throughout the Psalms, you see things

960
00:43:23.345 --> 00:43:25.415
where they're wrestling with the realities of

961
00:43:25.415 --> 00:43:26.615
what they're experiencing in life

962
00:43:26.635 --> 00:43:28.495
and they say, God, where are you?

963
00:43:29.615 --> 00:43:31.075
In the very same psalm, they're like,

964
00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:32.235
God, thank you for never leaving me.

965
00:43:34.085 --> 00:43:36.575
Wait, didn't you just say, God? Where are you?

966
00:43:36.845 --> 00:43:38.375
Because they didn't feel it at the time,

967
00:43:38.395 --> 00:43:40.295
but then they know it's like limitations.

968
00:43:40.395 --> 00:43:44.435
God, remind me again of your mercy.

969
00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:47.715
I go back, I remember how good you are.

970
00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:51.155
But that's the wrestling that we will go through.

971
00:43:51.155 --> 00:43:53.755
It's, it's hard. And I would just say, yes,

972
00:43:54.185 --> 00:43:55.875
good sign that you're there.

973
00:43:56.535 --> 00:43:58.435
And, and let's just keep pressing into that.

974
00:44:00.125 --> 00:44:02.385
So one of the questions that always comes up in this

975
00:44:02.605 --> 00:44:03.705
is, why is this?

976
00:44:04.565 --> 00:44:05.865
Or how is this fair?

977
00:44:07.275 --> 00:44:09.845
When you think about predestination, what even in

978
00:44:09.845 --> 00:44:11.205
that term define means,

979
00:44:11.255 --> 00:44:12.565
which I'll, I'll do that in a second.

980
00:44:12.705 --> 00:44:16.405
But what we commonly push back on in this is it feels like

981
00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:19.185
it's unjust, you know, God,

982
00:44:20.835 --> 00:44:21.855
how, how could you do this?

983
00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:25.655
How could you save some and not others? Is it fair?

984
00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:31.565
Well, here's the word predestined in the scripture is pro

985
00:44:31.875 --> 00:44:33.765
orzo, which means determining beforehand,

986
00:44:33.995 --> 00:44:35.685
ordaining, deciding ahead of time.

987
00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:38.605
So predestination is God determining certain things

988
00:44:38.605 --> 00:44:40.165
to occur ahead of time.

989
00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:43.735
So Romans eight said, he cer determined certain individuals

990
00:44:43.735 --> 00:44:45.175
be conformed to the likeness of his son,

991
00:44:45.595 --> 00:44:48.815
be called justified, glorified believers being chosen.

992
00:44:48.835 --> 00:44:50.175
We saw that in Ephesians one,

993
00:44:51.315 --> 00:44:52.975
God in his sovereignty chooses certain

994
00:44:52.975 --> 00:44:54.615
individuals to be saved.

995
00:44:56.325 --> 00:44:59.465
Now this is not willy-nilly outside of his character.

996
00:45:00.535 --> 00:45:03.835
God is just, God is good, God is merciful.

997
00:45:03.835 --> 00:45:05.475
We looked at all his attributes, big rock, right?

998
00:45:08.335 --> 00:45:11.755
So he's not just kind of throwing darts at the wall.

999
00:45:12.695 --> 00:45:15.385
There's a personal relational aspect to this,

1000
00:45:15.445 --> 00:45:17.465
but the same objection still comes up.

1001
00:45:17.605 --> 00:45:18.825
Is it unfair?

1002
00:45:20.285 --> 00:45:23.065
So why would God choose certain individuals and not others?

1003
00:45:24.435 --> 00:45:25.435
Is that fair?

1004
00:45:28.445 --> 00:45:30.935
Yeah, that's kind of a two-edged sword.

1005
00:45:30.955 --> 00:45:35.895
If you want God to be fair, um, none of us would be saved.

1006
00:45:36.755 --> 00:45:38.855
Uh, we would all end up in hell.

1007
00:45:39.275 --> 00:45:42.655
Um, so we gotta be really careful there by saying

1008
00:45:43.355 --> 00:45:46.655
we want God to be fair, so he should save me

1009
00:45:46.795 --> 00:45:48.015
or he should save someone else.

1010
00:45:48.555 --> 00:45:50.055
If we wanted God to be fair,

1011
00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:52.295
I don't think we would like the outcome.

1012
00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:54.095
So God is not fair.

1013
00:45:54.995 --> 00:45:59.655
Um, fairness is, uh, something that comes later after sin.

1014
00:45:59.915 --> 00:46:02.735
We, we compare ourselves to others. We say that's not fair.

1015
00:46:04.035 --> 00:46:08.735
God is just, um, he is unchangeable,

1016
00:46:08.845 --> 00:46:11.135
immutable and his character's always the same,

1017
00:46:11.315 --> 00:46:15.775
but he does not deal, uh, with all men the same.

1018
00:46:16.125 --> 00:46:17.855
They, we all have different paths.

1019
00:46:17.855 --> 00:46:21.975
We all have different, uh, different stories in our life,

1020
00:46:21.975 --> 00:46:23.775
different roadblocks, different challenges.

1021
00:46:25.435 --> 00:46:28.765
And uh, to say

1022
00:46:28.765 --> 00:46:31.325
that is not fair is to

1023
00:46:32.265 --> 00:46:34.925
put ourselves in God's place and try to play God.

1024
00:46:35.665 --> 00:46:36.925
Uh, we have to be really careful

1025
00:46:36.955 --> 00:46:38.245
with the word fair, I think.

1026
00:46:38.465 --> 00:46:42.045
And as sinners, uh, to

1027
00:46:43.415 --> 00:46:46.325
blame God or to to discredit God

1028
00:46:46.465 --> 00:46:49.445
for something we don't think is right, is really,

1029
00:46:49.445 --> 00:46:50.885
really a dangerous place to be.

1030
00:46:51.745 --> 00:46:55.285
Uh, what's not fair is that Christ, that God sent his son

1031
00:46:55.345 --> 00:46:56.565
to die on our behalf.

1032
00:46:57.385 --> 00:46:59.565
Uh, but to say that God is not fair

1033
00:47:00.345 --> 00:47:05.165
and uh, to to, to to,

1034
00:47:05.225 --> 00:47:08.725
to push on him something that is part of the sin nature,

1035
00:47:08.965 --> 00:47:12.845
I think is unfair in our own, uh, in our own way.

1036
00:47:13.505 --> 00:47:16.205
Um, I don't know if I'm making any sense there,

1037
00:47:16.265 --> 00:47:20.925
but that's a, to say God is not fair, uh,

1038
00:47:21.265 --> 00:47:24.965
is I think is is unfair of us to do that.

1039
00:47:25.435 --> 00:47:28.125
He's holy, he's righteous, he never makes mistakes.

1040
00:47:28.265 --> 00:47:31.285
He is perfect and without sin.

1041
00:47:31.385 --> 00:47:33.845
And for us to say who are sinful, fall

1042
00:47:33.845 --> 00:47:37.005
and broken, that's not fair is a little bit out

1043
00:47:37.005 --> 00:47:38.125
of, uh, outta whack.

1044
00:47:39.115 --> 00:47:43.765
Yeah. So I think we have a, we have an an awareness

1045
00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:47.445
or understanding of fairness that demands equal outcomes.

1046
00:47:49.555 --> 00:47:53.855
Fairness is equal treatment, right? Equal perspective.

1047
00:47:55.395 --> 00:47:57.215
And it can, it can mean either way.

1048
00:47:57.555 --> 00:47:59.175
But the fairness we're talking about is

1049
00:47:59.175 --> 00:48:00.255
not always equal outcomes.

1050
00:48:01.815 --> 00:48:05.495
Fairness is that he is treating everyone equally now

1051
00:48:06.845 --> 00:48:10.895
that there's an illustration given where, uh,

1052
00:48:11.735 --> 00:48:13.735
thinking about no one deserves anything from God,

1053
00:48:14.285 --> 00:48:16.095
therefore no one can object if he does

1054
00:48:16.095 --> 00:48:17.135
not receive anything from God.

1055
00:48:17.155 --> 00:48:21.295
So an illustration is a man walking into a group

1056
00:48:21.295 --> 00:48:23.575
of 20 people and randomly handing out money to five of them.

1057
00:48:26.275 --> 00:48:27.735
Now, the 15 people standing around

1058
00:48:27.735 --> 00:48:29.575
who didn't get any money would probably be upset, right?

1059
00:48:30.945 --> 00:48:32.205
Do they have a right to be upset?

1060
00:48:34.455 --> 00:48:37.705
No, because none of the 20 deserved money to begin

1061
00:48:37.705 --> 00:48:39.345
with, right?

1062
00:48:39.345 --> 00:48:41.345
They didn't have any expectation that this was coming.

1063
00:48:41.395 --> 00:48:45.585
There was no owing anyone money.

1064
00:48:45.725 --> 00:48:47.945
And he walks in and hands a few of that.

1065
00:48:48.045 --> 00:48:50.825
He simply decided to be gracious to some of those.

1066
00:48:50.845 --> 00:48:52.425
And I, I don't want that to sound cold,

1067
00:48:53.785 --> 00:48:55.205
but that's what he was getting to.

1068
00:48:55.205 --> 00:48:58.605
The idea of like, well, I I use the illustration

1069
00:48:58.605 --> 00:48:59.685
of the orphanage on Sunday.

1070
00:49:01.125 --> 00:49:02.725
I mean, what about the others who didn't get

1071
00:49:02.875 --> 00:49:04.165
adopted out of the orphanage?

1072
00:49:04.165 --> 00:49:06.285
What they feel like this is unfair.

1073
00:49:08.255 --> 00:49:10.345
They would've loved to be adopted as well, right?

1074
00:49:12.145 --> 00:49:14.125
And so that sounds so cold,

1075
00:49:14.185 --> 00:49:17.825
but this is where we have to realize God is God.

1076
00:49:17.965 --> 00:49:20.765
We are not. And we lean on his mercy.

1077
00:49:21.745 --> 00:49:23.365
We lean on his grace,

1078
00:49:24.585 --> 00:49:27.685
and he, he has mercy on whom he will.

1079
00:49:29.125 --> 00:49:32.105
And the fact that all of us deserve wrath

1080
00:49:32.485 --> 00:49:35.435
and hell is part of the reality of

1081
00:49:35.435 --> 00:49:36.555
what we believe in scripture.

1082
00:49:37.235 --> 00:49:38.505
Every one of us deserves that.

1083
00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:43.265
That's why the point was humility and worship on Sunday.

1084
00:49:44.045 --> 00:49:47.425
If we believe in Jesus as our savior, then

1085
00:49:49.115 --> 00:49:52.575
we should be dumbfounded, stunned by that.

1086
00:49:53.195 --> 00:49:55.895
And if we start thinking implications of what about this

1087
00:49:55.895 --> 00:49:57.175
and what about that we're missing,

1088
00:49:57.655 --> 00:50:00.415
I think really the the main point what he's done.

1089
00:50:01.115 --> 00:50:03.345
And we can't miss that as we go forward.

1090
00:50:04.045 --> 00:50:05.825
And Romans nine has a lot about that,

1091
00:50:05.825 --> 00:50:07.385
about injustice on God's part.

1092
00:50:07.385 --> 00:50:09.145
And Paul is defending the argument.

1093
00:50:09.855 --> 00:50:13.785
He's saying, well, how can we say these things about that?

1094
00:50:14.405 --> 00:50:16.505
Uh, there's a parable of Matthew 20 that kind

1095
00:50:16.505 --> 00:50:17.825
of talks about the giving of money

1096
00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:20.225
and uh, the people working in the vineyard

1097
00:50:20.225 --> 00:50:22.545
and some worked all day, some worked half the day,

1098
00:50:22.665 --> 00:50:25.505
some worked, and the owner gave them all the same amount at

1099
00:50:25.505 --> 00:50:27.905
the end and they were like, wait a second, I worked all day.

1100
00:50:28.285 --> 00:50:31.145
And he's like, yeah, but you agreed to that and,

1101
00:50:31.285 --> 00:50:33.865
and I agreed to that with these and, and it's my money.

1102
00:50:34.025 --> 00:50:35.025
I can give what I want.

1103
00:50:35.245 --> 00:50:38.705
And so that was what he gave to some,

1104
00:50:38.705 --> 00:50:40.825
they deserve this others more than they deserve.

1105
00:50:40.855 --> 00:50:42.145
It's not unfair to give extra

1106
00:50:42.145 --> 00:50:44.945
to some even they're less deserving others. So

1107
00:50:45.655 --> 00:50:47.585
Yeah, I think that's, that's one reason it's important

1108
00:50:47.585 --> 00:50:48.985
that we look at

1109
00:50:48.985 --> 00:50:53.745
and study the attributes of God as we approach these types

1110
00:50:53.745 --> 00:50:56.305
of topics because we have to rest on those things.

1111
00:50:56.305 --> 00:50:58.225
We know that scripture teaches us about God,

1112
00:50:58.225 --> 00:51:03.145
about his sovereignty, about his omniscience, um, and, and

1113
00:51:03.245 --> 00:51:06.345
and his goodness and his holiness and his justness.

1114
00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:10.905
And we can lean into that, um, into those attributes that,

1115
00:51:11.095 --> 00:51:14.985
that we know to be true, to be true without question.

1116
00:51:15.525 --> 00:51:19.385
And those should help us shape our view

1117
00:51:19.845 --> 00:51:22.385
of these doctrines when there are scriptures that seem

1118
00:51:22.385 --> 00:51:23.665
to be in question

1119
00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:25.745
or people raise questions over certain scriptures

1120
00:51:26.095 --> 00:51:30.345
that we lean totally on who we know God to be,

1121
00:51:31.545 --> 00:51:33.565
um, and how he relates to his people.

1122
00:51:35.475 --> 00:51:38.765
Okay, so we got about nine, 10 minutes left.

1123
00:51:40.025 --> 00:51:44.125
One of the common questions as well as you can see,

1124
00:51:44.125 --> 00:51:46.125
there's a lot of common questions to this, isn't there?

1125
00:51:46.745 --> 00:51:50.565
Um, what about free will?

1126
00:51:52.295 --> 00:51:53.395
Are we just robots?

1127
00:51:54.215 --> 00:51:56.515
If this is what we believe about salvation

1128
00:51:56.575 --> 00:51:58.155
and God does it's God's work

1129
00:51:58.215 --> 00:52:00.515
and does this just make us robots?

1130
00:52:02.935 --> 00:52:05.465
Well, there's a concept, and I'm not even sure if I'm saying

1131
00:52:05.465 --> 00:52:08.705
it right, antinomy, antinomy, I dunno how you say it.

1132
00:52:08.705 --> 00:52:12.705
Anti A-N-T-I-N-O-M-Y antinomy

1133
00:52:12.705 --> 00:52:15.265
or anami, I'm not sure exactly which way to say it,

1134
00:52:15.285 --> 00:52:17.985
but it, the word means an apparent conflict

1135
00:52:18.205 --> 00:52:21.065
or contradiction between two things.

1136
00:52:21.285 --> 00:52:23.665
And so between clearly established biblical truth.

1137
00:52:24.725 --> 00:52:28.185
And so the root of that is human logic,

1138
00:52:29.015 --> 00:52:32.465
because the problem's not in the divine revelation.

1139
00:52:32.525 --> 00:52:34.145
The problem is in our limited understanding

1140
00:52:34.145 --> 00:52:36.745
and ability to discern how those things work together.

1141
00:52:36.745 --> 00:52:38.145
Those are not contradictions.

1142
00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:41.345
This is an antinomy or anno me.

1143
00:52:42.485 --> 00:52:44.425
So the Bible, let me give you an example.

1144
00:52:45.165 --> 00:52:46.865
The Trinity, the Bible teaches the God,

1145
00:52:46.925 --> 00:52:48.785
the Father's God, God the Son is God.

1146
00:52:48.805 --> 00:52:49.865
God the Spirit is God.

1147
00:52:50.295 --> 00:52:51.345
When you put them all together,

1148
00:52:51.345 --> 00:52:52.945
they're not three gods, they're one God.

1149
00:52:53.335 --> 00:52:54.665
Each is fully God. Yet there's,

1150
00:52:54.665 --> 00:52:59.465
but one God, human logic, whole boy, right?

1151
00:53:01.175 --> 00:53:05.375
But we could get to tri theism if we try to understand it,

1152
00:53:06.085 --> 00:53:08.025
but we're ignoring all the pastors say God is one.

1153
00:53:08.205 --> 00:53:09.545
So we have to say God is one.

1154
00:53:09.565 --> 00:53:10.625
We agree that God the Father,

1155
00:53:10.685 --> 00:53:12.385
son the Holy Spirit are distinct yet one.

1156
00:53:12.525 --> 00:53:14.305
So we don't try to promote one over the other.

1157
00:53:15.285 --> 00:53:19.075
We we come to say

1158
00:53:19.155 --> 00:53:20.555
what the Bible says about this, right?

1159
00:53:20.905 --> 00:53:22.675
Same kind of thing here with salvation.

1160
00:53:22.945 --> 00:53:24.475
Does it occur by believing? Yes.

1161
00:53:24.815 --> 00:53:26.605
Is man responsible for believing? Yes.

1162
00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:28.845
Does God desire men to be saved? Yes.

1163
00:53:29.075 --> 00:53:31.125
Does God elect some to salvation? Yes.

1164
00:53:31.545 --> 00:53:32.805
Can we fully work this all out

1165
00:53:32.805 --> 00:53:33.925
within the limits of human logic?

1166
00:53:34.265 --> 00:53:38.085
No. However, we must not promote one

1167
00:53:38.085 --> 00:53:39.085
of those truths over another.

1168
00:53:39.105 --> 00:53:40.765
We will achieve biblical imbalance.

1169
00:53:40.765 --> 00:53:42.045
This is a dangerous place.

1170
00:53:42.045 --> 00:53:44.365
It creates wrong beliefs and disunity.

1171
00:53:44.505 --> 00:53:48.165
So as we're talk, listen, as we're talking about all this,

1172
00:53:49.195 --> 00:53:50.685
this is just try to give the background

1173
00:53:51.235 --> 00:53:54.805
what you hear all the time is what a call

1174
00:53:54.805 --> 00:53:55.885
to repent and belief.

1175
00:53:57.045 --> 00:53:58.185
And I'm not saying, hey,

1176
00:53:58.185 --> 00:53:59.825
if you're elect, repent and belief, right?

1177
00:54:00.985 --> 00:54:02.925
That's foolishness.

1178
00:54:04.825 --> 00:54:08.755
What we're saying is there is a command in scripture

1179
00:54:08.895 --> 00:54:13.655
to believe, and yet God elects to salvation

1180
00:54:13.755 --> 00:54:14.895
and God works salvation.

1181
00:54:14.995 --> 00:54:16.775
So, so that's where we're starting

1182
00:54:16.775 --> 00:54:18.895
to logically figure out how to untangle that.

1183
00:54:18.915 --> 00:54:21.975
No, we can't, we gotta keep it, we gotta keep it here.

1184
00:54:23.645 --> 00:54:27.225
And so does this somehow, does this irresistible grace, this

1185
00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:29.705
God doing his thing, does that conflict

1186
00:54:29.775 --> 00:54:31.265
with man's free will somehow?

1187
00:54:31.295 --> 00:54:32.825
Like how do we get to that? How?

1188
00:54:33.185 --> 00:54:35.105
Because we are supposed to believe we're commanded

1189
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.785
to believe, but God does it.

1190
00:54:37.785 --> 00:54:41.145
How does this, does, does that not walk in conflict somehow?

1191
00:54:41.805 --> 00:54:42.805
How does that work out?

1192
00:54:44.185 --> 00:54:48.725
Go ahead. I think, I mean, the answer is no,

1193
00:54:48.725 --> 00:54:51.245
it's not in conflict because it's because it's true.

1194
00:54:51.865 --> 00:54:55.405
And so it's how we think about it

1195
00:54:55.675 --> 00:54:57.405
that creates that antenna.

1196
00:54:58.145 --> 00:54:59.845
I'm just gonna go with one. Go ahead and commit to it.

1197
00:55:00.425 --> 00:55:04.485
Um, but that, I think it, it gets back to the fact that

1198
00:55:05.595 --> 00:55:07.935
the reality is yes, we, we choose

1199
00:55:07.935 --> 00:55:09.135
to put our faith in Christ,

1200
00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:11.815
but we don't have the ability to do that without the work

1201
00:55:11.815 --> 00:55:14.735
of the Holy Spirit, without the, without the work

1202
00:55:14.735 --> 00:55:16.175
of God in our lives.

1203
00:55:16.175 --> 00:55:20.735
Without him giving that free gift of grace for us

1204
00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:24.495
to have faith, to repent and believe it's only through him

1205
00:55:24.915 --> 00:55:28.335
and so on the, on the front end it does, it feels like,

1206
00:55:28.475 --> 00:55:29.655
yes, I'm making that choice.

1207
00:55:31.105 --> 00:55:32.165
But the more we grow

1208
00:55:32.185 --> 00:55:34.725
and understand who God is, we understand He did

1209
00:55:34.725 --> 00:55:37.125
that in me, right.

1210
00:55:37.395 --> 00:55:38.485
That yeah, I did it.

1211
00:55:38.545 --> 00:55:41.325
But he, I mean like I walked down the aisle,

1212
00:55:41.365 --> 00:55:43.445
I raised my hand and prayed the prayer, said the words,

1213
00:55:43.545 --> 00:55:46.645
but it was his spirit already at work in me doing

1214
00:55:46.645 --> 00:55:50.685
that regenerative work, putting that seed of faith in me.

1215
00:55:53.095 --> 00:55:55.985
Yeah. And we do have free will to some degree.

1216
00:55:56.365 --> 00:55:58.145
If somebody says that to you, ask them

1217
00:55:58.145 --> 00:56:00.185
what do they mean by free will?

1218
00:56:01.325 --> 00:56:04.865
And um, you know, we have freedom of choice.

1219
00:56:05.085 --> 00:56:06.705
You chose to come here tonight.

1220
00:56:07.725 --> 00:56:10.505
Uh, but your will,

1221
00:56:10.985 --> 00:56:12.745
I would argue your will is not free.

1222
00:56:12.765 --> 00:56:13.825
You're, you're bound.

1223
00:56:14.005 --> 00:56:16.745
We, we read in Ephesians chapter two that your bound

1224
00:56:17.725 --> 00:56:22.145
in darkness and death and, and sin and trespasses.

1225
00:56:22.165 --> 00:56:23.885
And so your will is not free.

1226
00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:27.125
It's free to sin, it's free to, to,

1227
00:56:27.225 --> 00:56:29.285
to make decisions in this fallen world.

1228
00:56:30.225 --> 00:56:33.485
But your will is not free, it's bound, it's not free

1229
00:56:33.505 --> 00:56:37.445
to choose to love God, to believe in Christ, to to,

1230
00:56:37.985 --> 00:56:39.845
to believe him by faith.

1231
00:56:39.985 --> 00:56:42.125
So your will is bound.

1232
00:56:42.315 --> 00:56:45.285
Even though we believe it's free, it is bound

1233
00:56:45.305 --> 00:56:48.285
and it takes what Tiar was was saying,

1234
00:56:48.345 --> 00:56:52.005
it takes the regenerative power of the Holy Spirit to,

1235
00:56:52.065 --> 00:56:53.325
to bring us back to life.

1236
00:56:53.385 --> 00:56:57.325
And then we find that our will, uh, is free.

1237
00:56:58.435 --> 00:57:00.845
Yeah. 'cause the Bible never says that man's will is free

1238
00:57:00.845 --> 00:57:02.085
of outside influences.

1239
00:57:03.645 --> 00:57:05.845
A person is only as free as his nature is free.

1240
00:57:06.585 --> 00:57:07.965
And so his will is limited to

1241
00:57:07.965 --> 00:57:09.125
that which is within his nature.

1242
00:57:09.705 --> 00:57:13.885
So like in our nature state, sin state, we're free

1243
00:57:15.955 --> 00:57:18.575
one direction, not even free in a sense

1244
00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:21.655
to understand the things of God.

1245
00:57:22.755 --> 00:57:25.295
So the fact that God moves within our will, creates a desire

1246
00:57:25.295 --> 00:57:26.895
for him is not a violation of free will.

1247
00:57:26.925 --> 00:57:29.415
It's a reprieve from a depraved will.

1248
00:57:31.005 --> 00:57:32.175
Like our will is depraved

1249
00:57:32.175 --> 00:57:33.975
and God grants us a reprieve from that.

1250
00:57:33.995 --> 00:57:35.415
So we can then desire.

1251
00:57:35.605 --> 00:57:37.975
Well I wanna give spurge in the last word here.

1252
00:57:38.435 --> 00:57:40.095
Uh, he's a lot smarter than we are.

1253
00:57:40.275 --> 00:57:42.815
So, uh, this is what he said about this.

1254
00:57:43.795 --> 00:57:46.735
So trying to reconcile God's sovereignty,

1255
00:57:46.735 --> 00:57:47.735
human responsibility.

1256
00:57:48.055 --> 00:57:51.815
I heard David Platt say those are unexplainable friends,

1257
00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:55.135
but undeniable truths, God's sovereignty,

1258
00:57:55.645 --> 00:57:58.255
he's in full control, human responsibility

1259
00:57:58.365 --> 00:58:00.655
that we are responsible somehow.

1260
00:58:00.925 --> 00:58:04.495
Okay? So think that this is what Spurgeon said, uh,

1261
00:58:04.535 --> 00:58:06.175
150 plus years ago.

1262
00:58:06.175 --> 00:58:08.815
He said The system of truth revealed in the scriptures is

1263
00:58:08.815 --> 00:58:11.055
not simply one straight line, but two.

1264
00:58:11.675 --> 00:58:14.055
And no man will ever get a right view of the gospel

1265
00:58:14.225 --> 00:58:16.815
until he knows how to look at the two lines at once.

1266
00:58:17.915 --> 00:58:19.855
For instance, I read one book of the Bible, the spirit

1267
00:58:19.855 --> 00:58:22.055
and the brides say, come let him

1268
00:58:22.055 --> 00:58:23.735
that hears say come let him.

1269
00:58:23.735 --> 00:58:24.935
That's thirsty. Come

1270
00:58:25.115 --> 00:58:28.095
who whosoever will let him take the water of life freely.

1271
00:58:29.275 --> 00:58:31.415
Yet I'm taught in another part of the same inspired word

1272
00:58:31.415 --> 00:58:34.455
that it is not of him that wills nor him that works,

1273
00:58:34.555 --> 00:58:36.815
but him, that shows mercy, God.

1274
00:58:38.075 --> 00:58:40.895
So I see in one place God in providence, presiding overall,

1275
00:58:41.035 --> 00:58:43.335
and yet I see and cannot help seeing that man acts

1276
00:58:43.355 --> 00:58:45.815
as he pleases, that God has left his actions in a great

1277
00:58:45.815 --> 00:58:47.015
measure to his own free will.

1278
00:58:48.005 --> 00:58:50.945
Now, if I were to declare that man was so free to act

1279
00:58:50.945 --> 00:58:53.585
that there was no control of God over his actions,

1280
00:58:54.065 --> 00:58:56.025
I should be driven very near to atheism.

1281
00:58:57.265 --> 00:58:59.205
And if on the other hand, I should declare that God

1282
00:58:59.345 --> 00:59:02.325
so overrules all things that man's not free enough

1283
00:59:02.325 --> 00:59:04.405
to be responsible, I should be driven at once

1284
00:59:04.425 --> 00:59:06.725
to antinomianism, which means no law

1285
00:59:06.825 --> 00:59:11.205
or fatalism that God.

1286
00:59:11.205 --> 00:59:14.005
So here's how he concludes that God predestines,

1287
00:59:14.005 --> 00:59:16.845
and yet that man is responsible are two facts

1288
00:59:16.915 --> 00:59:18.445
that few can see clearly.

1289
00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:21.325
They are believed to be inconsistent

1290
00:59:21.465 --> 00:59:23.125
or contradictory to each other.

1291
00:59:25.105 --> 00:59:27.325
If then I find taught in one part of the Bible

1292
00:59:27.325 --> 00:59:29.565
that everything is for ordained, that is true.

1293
00:59:30.785 --> 00:59:33.565
And if I find in another scripture that man is responsible

1294
00:59:33.565 --> 00:59:37.885
for all his actions, that is true, and it is only my folly

1295
00:59:37.885 --> 00:59:39.765
or foolishness that leads me to imagine

1296
00:59:39.765 --> 00:59:42.765
that these two truths can ever contradict each other.

1297
00:59:44.585 --> 00:59:47.905
I do not believe they can be welded into one upon any

1298
00:59:48.055 --> 00:59:52.705
earthly anvil, but they certainly shall be in eternity.

1299
00:59:53.995 --> 00:59:55.175
So here's the image. Watch this.

1300
00:59:55.565 --> 00:59:59.135
They are two lines that are so neatly parallel

1301
00:59:59.405 --> 01:00:02.495
that the human mind, which pursues them farthest,

1302
01:00:02.885 --> 01:00:07.415
will never discover that they converge, but they do converge

1303
01:00:07.475 --> 01:00:09.855
and they will meet somewhere in eternity, close

1304
01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:12.295
to the throne of God where all truth springs from.

1305
01:00:15.135 --> 01:00:18.235
And so we have to walk in a measure of humility

1306
01:00:20.235 --> 01:00:22.095
to embrace the truths of his word.

1307
01:00:22.095 --> 01:00:24.015
Even when we can't fully understand

1308
01:00:24.035 --> 01:00:26.255
or comprehend how these truths might work

1309
01:00:26.355 --> 01:00:29.495
or fit together, we have to walk in grace

1310
01:00:29.595 --> 01:00:33.375
and humility towards one another for our own beliefs,

1311
01:00:33.555 --> 01:00:36.975
our sys, like we have to walk in grace, humility

1312
01:00:37.075 --> 01:00:38.895
for ourselves in a way too.

1313
01:00:41.495 --> 01:00:45.795
All of us have have grown

1314
01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:49.915
and adapted and moved and tweaked and taken a journey,

1315
01:00:50.535 --> 01:00:51.635
and we're still not done.

1316
01:00:53.135 --> 01:00:54.245
Every time we go to the Bible,

1317
01:00:54.305 --> 01:00:56.965
we should be growing in our understanding of who he is

1318
01:00:56.965 --> 01:01:00.285
and what he's done, how salvation works, all that,

1319
01:01:00.735 --> 01:01:03.205
which should again, lead us to humility.

1320
01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:06.185
We should never walk around

1321
01:01:06.185 --> 01:01:07.865
self-righteous about our belief system.

1322
01:01:09.715 --> 01:01:12.245
I'll talk about that this Sunday actually about some things

1323
01:01:12.245 --> 01:01:14.965
that we kind of stand in judgment over other people

1324
01:01:14.965 --> 01:01:16.285
because they don't have it figured out like we do.

1325
01:01:17.725 --> 01:01:19.665
That's a dangerous place to be.

1326
01:01:21.575 --> 01:01:26.555
So hold your beliefs, yes, let's hold our beliefs firmly

1327
01:01:28.255 --> 01:01:29.515
but also graciously

1328
01:01:29.515 --> 01:01:31.675
and open handedly a little bit that

1329
01:01:32.865 --> 01:01:34.375
we're gonna grow every one

1330
01:01:34.375 --> 01:01:36.375
of us in our beliefs and understandings of these things.

1331
01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:42.175
So we're gonna be here, I got some resources up here,

1332
01:01:43.155 --> 01:01:45.935
uh, including this is actually on our website.

1333
01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.255
It's called The Origin of Salvation.

1334
01:01:47.255 --> 01:01:50.695
Dennis Newkirk, previous senior pastor, wrote this, uh,

1335
01:01:51.215 --> 01:01:54.415
a number of years ago, but it's the origin of salvation

1336
01:01:54.415 --> 01:01:56.015
and Salvation of work of God or man.

1337
01:01:56.315 --> 01:01:58.135
Uh, so this is kind of a position paper we have

1338
01:01:58.275 --> 01:01:59.295
as an elder council

1339
01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:02.815
and then a bunch of other resources up here you can look

1340
01:02:02.815 --> 01:02:04.135
at and come look at.

1341
01:02:04.135 --> 01:02:06.335
But then we're going to, uh, to be available,

1342
01:02:08.005 --> 01:02:09.485
probably they gotta use this room here in a little bit.

1343
01:02:09.485 --> 01:02:12.765
So probably out there more as we can to, uh, talk about

1344
01:02:13.405 --> 01:02:14.765
questions you may have follow ups you may have.

1345
01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:18.285
Uh, but then let's just pray as we go forward in this.

1346
01:02:19.795 --> 01:02:23.765
Lord, we, we look at this and we could talk for hours

1347
01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:27.365
and hours and hours more about these things and questions

1348
01:02:27.465 --> 01:02:29.405
and implications.

1349
01:02:29.465 --> 01:02:32.805
And so, God, we just, I pray for me, for us, for this,

1350
01:02:33.195 --> 01:02:36.445
this body, these who've heard this tonight, uh,

1351
01:02:36.555 --> 01:02:39.405
that either maybe for the first time they're wrestling

1352
01:02:39.405 --> 01:02:40.405
with this, it's all new,

1353
01:02:41.465 --> 01:02:43.725
or maybe this was a, an affirmation for them

1354
01:02:43.785 --> 01:02:48.465
and just continuing to open their hearts to the humility,

1355
01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:50.265
uh, that they have before you.

1356
01:02:51.005 --> 01:02:54.055
Or maybe there's some, some pushback and questions.

1357
01:02:54.295 --> 01:02:58.005
I pray God, you'd give us grace that we,

1358
01:02:58.225 --> 01:03:00.045
we believe the same big rocks here

1359
01:03:02.035 --> 01:03:03.335
and there's some difference here.

1360
01:03:03.395 --> 01:03:05.415
We can nuance this here and there.

1361
01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.495
But really, God, we see the end game of this, as I said,

1362
01:03:08.495 --> 01:03:11.985
Sunday, the end game is, is really the,

1363
01:03:12.165 --> 01:03:15.345
the same God you've called us to repent and believe.

1364
01:03:15.505 --> 01:03:18.025
And we are called to go take the gospel to all people.

1365
01:03:19.385 --> 01:03:21.365
We don't have a radar telling us who is who.

1366
01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:24.565
We just are called to preach this gospel of good news,

1367
01:03:24.565 --> 01:03:26.885
of salvation in Christ alone.

1368
01:03:30.345 --> 01:03:32.365
We grow because of you. We know that's true.

1369
01:03:32.545 --> 01:03:36.225
God, we know that it's because of your work in our hearts.

1370
01:03:38.635 --> 01:03:40.375
So Lord, give us a measure of

1371
01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:45.675
dependence, of understanding.

1372
01:03:45.825 --> 01:03:50.125
Yeah, but also that humility to say, God,

1373
01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.245
there's gonna be some mystery here.

1374
01:03:51.985 --> 01:03:53.915
That door that we walk through to salvation.

1375
01:03:55.055 --> 01:03:57.435
You, you've called us all yes to come,

1376
01:03:57.435 --> 01:03:58.635
but we look on the other side that you,

1377
01:03:58.695 --> 01:04:00.715
you called us from the, before the foundation of the world

1378
01:04:01.535 --> 01:04:03.195
and gave us the faith to open that door.

1379
01:04:03.295 --> 01:04:04.315
So thank you God for that.

1380
01:04:04.315 --> 01:04:07.035
And I pray for anyone in this room or,

1381
01:04:07.035 --> 01:04:09.435
or those that they love are struggling with the faith

1382
01:04:09.465 --> 01:04:12.675
that they want to have or, or think they have.

1383
01:04:12.695 --> 01:04:15.615
And there's, there's some unsettledness

1384
01:04:15.635 --> 01:04:16.815
in their heart right now.

1385
01:04:19.205 --> 01:04:20.645
I pray God, that this would not,

1386
01:04:21.115 --> 01:04:23.245
that the enemy would not snatch this away,

1387
01:04:23.945 --> 01:04:26.205
but it would be deep rooted, good soil,

1388
01:04:27.165 --> 01:04:28.705
and it would bear fruit in their heart

1389
01:04:28.705 --> 01:04:30.865
that they would instead of wondering and questioning

1390
01:04:30.865 --> 01:04:34.145
and more doubts and more turmoil in their heart,

1391
01:04:34.215 --> 01:04:35.345
they would instead look

1392
01:04:35.525 --> 01:04:40.385
and see your goodness, your work, your salvation.

1393
01:04:41.695 --> 01:04:45.785
And they would just say, Jesus, you are mine.

1394
01:04:46.045 --> 01:04:48.865
I'm yours, you in my place. That's my hope.

1395
01:04:52.435 --> 01:04:54.435
I pray for more to believe that Lord, this,

1396
01:04:54.545 --> 01:04:58.435
this gives us encouragement, that you have guaranteed

1397
01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:01.835
that you will save from every tribe, tongue, and nation.

1398
01:05:01.835 --> 01:05:04.155
So when our missionaries go to the hard places, they know

1399
01:05:05.025 --> 01:05:09.275
that there will be someone, at least one who will believe.

1400
01:05:09.895 --> 01:05:11.235
So we don't give our lives for nothing.

1401
01:05:11.335 --> 01:05:14.675
God, we don't have to hold the pressure of being the one

1402
01:05:14.675 --> 01:05:18.365
that's so persuasive that we get people to be saved

1403
01:05:18.365 --> 01:05:20.005
because we're great at preaching the gospel.

1404
01:05:20.185 --> 01:05:22.405
No, it's because your work is happening. We trust you.

1405
01:05:23.225 --> 01:05:27.515
Do that more. God, we pray for your grace

1406
01:05:27.515 --> 01:05:29.875
and mercy as we go tonight to wrestle with your word.

1407
01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:32.715
I thank you that these will drive us to your word, to study,

1408
01:05:33.415 --> 01:05:36.035
to consider, to think and pray.

1409
01:05:36.695 --> 01:05:39.555
Ask your Holy Spirit to illuminate as one Corinthians says.

1410
01:05:40.925 --> 01:05:44.065
So lead us in that, lead us in a, a gracious way together,

1411
01:05:44.885 --> 01:05:47.905
uh, as we focus on the main things, the number one

1412
01:05:47.905 --> 01:05:49.025
and most important things.

1413
01:05:50.245 --> 01:05:52.385
And these things can be intramural, debates

1414
01:05:52.385 --> 01:05:54.065
and good questions and conversations,

1415
01:05:54.065 --> 01:05:55.865
but God, we wanna focus on the main things

1416
01:05:56.525 --> 01:05:58.105
and worship you in spirit and in truth.

1417
01:05:58.165 --> 01:06:01.905
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.

1418
01:06:03.165 --> 01:06:04.985
All right, thanks everybody. Love y'all.
