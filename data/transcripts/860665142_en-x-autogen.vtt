00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.060
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.780
I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.500
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.860
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.020
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.340
Good morning, church. So glad you're here.

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.620
I know you had choices today. You could have been anywhere. It's Labor Day,

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.940
but I'm glad you chose to be in the house of the Lord to worship.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.180
Wanna invite you to open your copy of God's word this morning,

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.820
we're gonna be in Psalm 62. Psalm 62,

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.020
a beautiful Psalm. My name is Perry, I'm your missions pastor.

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.500
I'm the new guy on the block.

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.260
And what an honor it is for me to come and just share with you from this

14
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.180
passage. It's a, it's a passage that's going to speak to all of us.

15
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.460
And the reason it will speak to all of us is because we will all pass through

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.820
these kind of things in our life.

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.180
Either you are coming out of a storm in your life and things

18
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.060
are looking better,

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.820
or you're in the middle of a storm and you're right in the thick of it right

20
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.620
now, or you're about to get into a storm and you don't even see it coming.

21
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.740
And this is a Psalms that will speak to us.

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.580
This is a Psalms that will bring amazing comfort to us during these times.

23
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.020
So you take this psalms,

24
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.260
you put it in your pocket because you're gonna need it someday.

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.380
We all will need it someday. You know, just in way of introduction,

26
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.060
this Psalms is the Psalms that David wrote during Absaloms with

27
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.180
son's rebellion when he was trying to kill David. And it's the Psalms.

28
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.100
This is that it's one of the most difficult times in David's life when he was

29
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.340
inspired by God to, to, to write this Psalms. It's when,

30
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.860
uh, Absalon has rebelled against him.

31
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.940
It's when it's when many of his trusted leaders have now turned against

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.020
him. And he's old.

33
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.020
He's old and feeling frail and there is imminent death

34
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.580
at the door. You have to ask yourself, what,

35
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.860
what is he gonna do? What will David do in those circumstances?

36
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.360
Lemme say something right here.

37
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.240
To be brought to a place where God is our only hope

38
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.440
is a merciful experience.

39
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.480
That doesn't sound right, but it's true.

40
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.840
To be brought to a place where God is our only real hope is a

41
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.880
merciful experience. But I don't say that lightly.

42
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.560
I don't say that lightly out of experience.

43
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.400
I know that these times always come in desperate

44
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.840
experiences. They always come in darkness.

45
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.240
The some extreme circumstance has happened in our life or some internal

46
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.440
conflict or internal crisis is we're in the middle of it.

47
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.320
And all of those things that you and I normally would use to get through that

48
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.960
period, they've just fallen short. They're not, they're not enough.

49
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.360
And we're left wanting and, and needing and, and they fail us.

50
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.920
It's in these moments that oftentimes we feel our weakness,

51
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.560
we feel our vulnerability, we feel fragile.

52
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.360
We feel like we're not going to be able to make it through those times.

53
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.040
And we'll usually during these times long and plead with God

54
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.800
for just an escape. Just get me out of these circumstances.

55
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.850
That's what this psalm is about.

56
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.490
That's what this psalm is gonna talk to us about this morning.

57
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.890
The first thing I want you to see this morning is a lesson learned waiting

58
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.650
for God alone. Psalm 62, 1 through four.

59
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.050
Let me read that passage and you follow along there in your copy of God's Word

60
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.570
For God alone, my soul waits in silence.

61
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.970
From him comes my salvation.

62
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.410
He alone is my rock in my salvation, my fortress,

63
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.690
I shall not be greatly shaken. How long,

64
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.370
how long will all of you attack a man and batter him like a leaning

65
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.650
wall or a tottering fence?

66
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.170
They only plan to thrust him down from his high position.

67
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.050
They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouth,

68
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.010
but inwardly they curse. Listen,

69
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.530
this is a psalm for those who are under stress.

70
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.290
This is a psalm during those difficult days,

71
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.930
and the key is found in verse one where it says,

72
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.290
for God alone, my soul waits in silence. Literally,

73
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.970
if you were to translate this,

74
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.850
the way that is said is only to towards God,

75
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.610
my soul is silenced. I love that.

76
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.090
Only when I'm looking at God is my soul silenced.

77
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.250
Now, let's just be honest.

78
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.730
When we're going through difficult times and trouble and life seems to be

79
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.570
imploding on us, I don't know about you, but my soul starts screaming.

80
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.810
I start telling myself, boy, if this doesn't happen or, or,

81
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.450
or this doesn't happen, or it happens and everything is lost,

82
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.490
if I don't get this or that, then and,

83
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.130
and then everything is going to come apart. In fact,

84
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.170
I go into kind of a mode of all or nothing thinking.

85
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.930
I don't even see the options anymore. It's just everything is gonna be okay,

86
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.090
or everything is the worst day of my life. It's just extremes.

87
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.930
During these times,

88
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.120
we assume during those times

89
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.600
that God is not enough,

90
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.320
not enough to get us through these times.

91
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.840
It's in the back of our minds.

92
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.440
Somehow we tell ourselves that we need a different circumstances,

93
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.520
we need a different condition.

94
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.720
We need some possession necessary to make us happy and to secure.

95
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.573
We worry.

96
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.760
We worry and we worry that God is not enough

97
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.960
to protect us and provide for us.

98
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.140
David, David had many desperate experiences in his lifetime.

99
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.540
I think about his life.

100
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.900
He lived in a brutal age and and endured tremendous pressure.

101
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.940
He lived in a time where, uh, most of his adult life, he had the,

102
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.300
he had death looming over him like a shadow almost every day.

103
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.580
He, he lived as a fugitive most of his life,

104
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.580
fleeing from King Saul's paranoia.

105
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.420
He's also a man that led many armies into battle and,

106
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.220
and faced war after war, after war, facing,

107
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.000
attacking armies. And if that wasn't enough,

108
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.440
David, for most of his life, experienced the anguish,

109
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.480
the anguish of knowing that some of his dear friends

110
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.320
and even his loving his love, his most loved son,

111
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.240
Absalom, had turned against him and was,

112
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.800
and was conniving and,

113
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.720
and wanted his demise and wanted his failure and even wanted his

114
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.240
death. And as I read the Psalms, I asked myself,

115
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.280
what did David do in those circumstances? I know what I would do.

116
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.400
I know what many of us would do. But what did David do? David,

117
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.720
he had learned to speak to his own soul.

118
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.280
And he had told himself, I need only one thing to survive.

119
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.600
I need only one thing to thrive, and I have it.

120
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.240
I only need God.

121
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.440
I only need God. And His all powerful fatherly love and his care,

122
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.080
everything else he says is expendable.

123
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.480
If I only have God, I have enough.

124
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.440
Listen, if you and I could learn that,

125
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.920
if you and I could grasp that and recognize that in our own lives,

126
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.960
we too would never be shaken. Like the Psalmist says here,

127
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.630
are you able to sing these words to God?

128
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.670
Are you able to pray a prayer like that? Lord,

129
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.480
I praise you for all of your sufficiency because you are enough.

130
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.160
You are enough in my heart. You are enough in my life.

131
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.320
You are enough in my joy, Lord,

132
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.200
I find rest in you alone.

133
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.400
Have you ever reached a place in your life

134
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.960
where you're silent and resting in the provisions and the

135
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.720
protection of God? If you haven't,

136
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.800
if you've never been there,

137
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.680
if you're always striving and manipulating and trying to claw your way of your

138
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.360
circumstances and you've never learned to stand before God in silence

139
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.520
and rest in him,

140
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:40.040
then you need to get to the end of yourself and you need to get

141
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.600
to the place where you can do nothing and God

142
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.900
can do everything in your life. In this Psalms,

143
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.060
we also see a lesson to be remembered,

144
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.180
and that is that salvation and hope are from God alone.

145
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.340
Listen to verses five through eight, for God alone,

146
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.500
my soul waits in silence.

147
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.820
For my hope is from him.

148
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.660
He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress,

149
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.420
I shall not be shaken on God rests my

150
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.420
salvation and my glory, my mighty rock,

151
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.540
my refuges God trust in him at all times.

152
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.940
O peoples pour out your hearts before him.

153
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.580
God is a refuge to us. Sayah,

154
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.420
that little word sayah there means pause and think about

155
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.020
it. Pause and think about it.

156
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.620
And that's exactly what David did here in verse five.

157
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.220
He pauses and he thinks about the lessons that he learned in verse

158
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.780
one. You know,

159
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.180
there is a battle that goes on inside of us at all times.

160
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.940
It is the battle to shape our hearts with the knowledge of the

161
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.460
truths that we know in our head, that God has told us to be true.

162
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.220
And it's a constant struggle sometimes, and we, we,

163
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.060
we are sometimes our feelings and the promises we know to be true just

164
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.620
don't seem to align.

165
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.950
When I read the Psalms and I think about David in these circumstances,

166
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.110
David didn't seem like he was feeling like his faith was growing,

167
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.110
that he was getting stronger. In fact, when I read the Psalms,

168
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.870
I see that David under the pressure of all of this,

169
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.030
he's feeling weak and vulnerable and fragile. It says,

170
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.830
he says, in fact,

171
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.320
he feels like an old stone wall that's bowing

172
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.440
and about to crumble under its own weight. He says he's,

173
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.880
he feels like a rickety old fence,

174
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.840
just moved to Edmund, Oklahoma, bought a house,

175
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.200
and one of the first things I'm gonna have to fix and a rickety old fence,

176
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.040
I go by there with my weed eater afraid that the weed eater is gonna knock this

177
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.760
fence over, right? We've all seen those fences. Listen,

178
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.680
that's the way David felt. He said, I feel like a rick of your old fence.

179
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.760
It's just about to fall over if somebody were to lean on it or, or,

180
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.480
or even touch it. Fragile, vulnerable.

181
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.880
Sometimes in these moments

182
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.440
of learning to trust God,

183
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.360
it is difficult times the test that comes to us and cut the test

184
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.240
that comes to our faith often feels like a threat to our

185
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.073
faith.

186
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.000
We feel like everything's gonna be dismantled and whatever form of adversity

187
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.880
we're experiencing, it just feels overwhelming.

188
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.520
We can identify with David, we feel weak, vulnerable, fragile, like a,

189
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.400
like a teetering, uh, fence or a, a wall that could crumble under its weight.

190
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:17.440
Sometimes we even have the temptation to wanna panic and just run.

191
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.840
We, we, we run from our friends, we've run from God,

192
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.280
we run from all of our helps into the darkness in panic.

193
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.300
So what are we to do? What are we supposed to do in those times?

194
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.420
And here is one of the great truths of the Bible. The gospel.

195
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.610
The gospel. Look what the psalmist says.

196
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.010
Salvation comes from God alone,

197
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.250
not from ourselves and not from anything else that we can produce.

198
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.610
Salvation comes from God alone. Listen to Romans chapter four,

199
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.453
verse five,

200
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.850
and to the one that you and I who does not work

201
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.130
but believes in him,

202
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.850
Jesus who justifies the ungodly,

203
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.930
his faith is counted as righteousness. Listen,

204
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.410
there are many verses in scripture that teach this, that it's not by our,

205
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.290
our our our striving and our working and our pleading,

206
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.290
that we receive our hope,

207
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:30.130
our hope and our salvation are found in God alone.

208
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.450
We must learn to silence the voices of our fears and to speak the

209
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.610
truth of God's promises into our life.

210
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.810
We need to knowing that because of his great love and his grace for us,

211
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:48.250
we are safe and secure in the Lord counted as righteous because

212
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.360
of what Christ has done for us on the cross.

213
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.400
It is all sufficient. Amen.

214
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.400
David, uh, he not only counsels himself,

215
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.800
he counsels others. I think that's one of the measures of knowing.

216
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.880
When you actually are growing and, and getting better in your circumstances,

217
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.200
it's not just about you anymore,

218
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.360
but somehow with the comfort with which you've been comforted,

219
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.720
now you're able to help someone else. That's exactly what David does here.

220
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.400
He says, you people, he's talking to himself,

221
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.000
but he's talking to us and he says, listen, with the same comfort,

222
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.920
God comforted me. You can be comforted. Let me,

223
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.280
are you able to lay down the impulse this morning of,

224
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.440
of just doing things to secure God's blessings and able

225
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.360
to rest, to rest in Christ and what he's done for you?

226
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.200
That is the message of the gospel. Can you pray this morning, Lord,

227
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.080
teach me to cast my deadly doing down at your feet and

228
00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.440
to stand in what you have accomplished in Jesus Christ,

229
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.400
gloriously complete in Christ. That is our hope,

230
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.840
that is our salvation. We learned in this passage too,

231
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.560
that we need to have a healthy skepticism.

232
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:19.720
We just can't be gullible here. It says trust in God and nothing else.

233
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.920
This passage starts and it says, Lowes of low estate are, but a breath.

234
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.800
Those of high estate are a delusion in the balance.

235
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.600
They go up and together,

236
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.120
they are lighter than a breath here.

237
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.160
David is telling us,

238
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.920
and he's basically taking all of those things that we normally look to for hope

239
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.840
and he's dismantling them. The first one he says is,

240
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.960
you don't need to trust in peoples, and he's used as plural or in the elite,

241
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.120
in the highs, in the specialist. I don't know about you,

242
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.600
but I can spend hours flipping on my iPad and I can see what

243
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.800
everybody thinks about something. And then I can also go deeper and I think,

244
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.280
well, this was a survey done and here's a specialist.

245
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.400
Surely he knows what he's talking about.

246
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.800
And I could base my life on popular opinion on what is politically correct.

247
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.960
What is everybody doing?

248
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.520
Or I could think I'm smart and I'm gonna go to the elite.

249
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.920
I'm gonna get somebody with a,

250
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.360
with some kind of a degree in front of their name. But here's what David says.

251
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.400
He says,

252
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.200
I could take all of that information and all of those people and I could

253
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.800
lift it up and it is lighter than a

254
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.080
breath. Why?

255
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.040
Because it's only manmade stuff. It, it does not help.

256
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.560
He goes on and he says in this passage that we can't put our trust in systems

257
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.200
and politics and all of this. It's here. He says, listen,

258
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.120
put no trust in exhortation, in vain hopes or robbery.

259
00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:02.800
I've lived, I have lived under socialism. I've lived under totalitarianism.

260
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.480
I've lived under capitalism.

261
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.880
I've been somebody who's lived after a dictator in a country one time.

262
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.400
And you know what I found? None of them,

263
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:17.040
none of them is going to make a better world. It just won't work.

264
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.640
I cannot put my hope in that. He goes on and says,

265
00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.280
put no hope in riches if, if your riches increase,

266
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.840
set not your heart on them. This verse is teaching me,

267
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.720
teaching you that we cannot trust a career path,

268
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.240
whether it's respectable or not. He says

269
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.160
to give us a sense of security and fulfillment.

270
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.640
So what can we trust in? What can we go to?

271
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.560
And the psalmist says, God,

272
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.040
God is the one that you can trust in God here in this passage is

273
00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.880
both strong and he is loving.

274
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.040
This causes a lot of trouble for people.

275
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.520
The Bible says that God is a just and a holy God,

276
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.280
but he is a loving God. You'll hear it this way many times.

277
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.580
Well,

278
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.240
how does a loving God send an innocent person to Hell?

279
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.120
And I've read this book through many times,

280
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.400
and the Bible does not answer that question.

281
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.440
What the Bible answers is,

282
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.640
how does a holy and a just God allow a sinful

283
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.880
person like me to enter into his presence?

284
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.760
He loves me so much that he gave his only begotten son to

285
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.880
die for me on a cross. He,

286
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.680
he declares us guilty in our sin,

287
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.680
but then he takes our punishment on the cross.

288
00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.240
Romans 6 23 says, the wages of sin is death,

289
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.320
but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ,

290
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.840
our Lord. Listen, if I believe that,

291
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:15.400
then when I'm going through the most difficult circumstances in my life,

292
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.800
I can also trust that same God

293
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.920
no matter how dark it gets, how desperate it gets.

294
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.000
I can trust God.

295
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.200
He has gone to every length to show us both his love and his

296
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.680
justice. And he is there for us.

297
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.680
We can pray. We can pray to the Lord and say, Lord, help me with,

298
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.080
with with help me to prosper in my work. But,

299
00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.280
but don't let a career have power over me. Lord,

300
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.520
provide for my family's financial leads.

301
00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.960
But don't ever let finances have a dominion over me. Lord,

302
00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.053
you could pray.

303
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.200
I I I need not love the things that you have given me less as a blessing in

304
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.880
my life, but I need to love you more.

305
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.880
I need to love you as a giver and not the gift today.

306
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.450
That's our prayer today.

307
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.610
Here we also see a lesson of trusting God at all

308
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.770
times. I said it earlier, and I'm gonna say it again,

309
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:30.330
to be brought to a place where God is our only real hope is a

310
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:35.180
merciful experience. Desperation.

311
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.580
Desperation is one of the greatest in instructors

312
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.780
and how to trust God.

313
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.750
But it's also one of the greatest instructors or teachers in

314
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.670
the school of prayer.

315
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:59.230
Few things move us to pour out our hearts to God in earnest prayer.

316
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.910
Then when everything seems on the line

317
00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.480
and we wonder if we're gonna make it,

318
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.480
these moments can happen in a second.

319
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.180
Everything can change. When I was writing this sermon

320
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.100
a week or so ago and reading this passage and studying it,

321
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.340
life was pretty good in our family.

322
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.980
Two and a half years ago, my sister had a grandson.

323
00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.340
His name was Simon, who was a beautiful little boy.

324
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.320
But shortly after his birth, he developed cancer.

325
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.160
Our family went to our knees. We prayed,

326
00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.440
we prayed. Lord, be merciful, heal little Simon. He's so precious.

327
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.400
He's such a gift. Lord, surely,

328
00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.520
surely it's your will to keep him here with us and let his love on him to

329
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.880
raise him in your knowledge.

330
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.840
We prayed to God and God was merciful.

331
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.160
After six months of treatment, Simon went home.

332
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.000
He was out of the hospital

333
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.120
and been there and been just a normal fun little boy. Just the other day,

334
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.360
he had came to Oklahoma to visit his great-grandparents.

335
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.440
But last week Simon got to not feeling good.

336
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.640
And so they went to the doctor and they took a blood test. Blood test was,

337
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.680
was cur. It was, it was clean. But because of his,

338
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.720
his history with cancer, they took a blown, a bone marrow test.

339
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.760
And sure enough, the cancer, the cancer is returned. Simon,

340
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.040
today's in a hospital room doing two months of chemotherapy.

341
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.960
If that goes well and everything works,

342
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.480
he's looking at a bone trail, a bone transplant,

343
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.480
a bone marrow transplant. If a,

344
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.200
if a donor is found and he,

345
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.000
he could spend up to a year in a hospital room before he is able to leave.

346
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.650
None of us saw that coming.

347
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.410
But I was on a zoom call and on that zoom call,

348
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:27.050
there was three generations of our family praying for the fourth.

349
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.930
There is nothing like these kind of times.

350
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.850
It will teach us how to pray any better.

351
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.410
It drives us to our knees and we seek God.

352
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.010
Most people just do not run into a fortress unless

353
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.050
they're faced with real danger coming their way.

354
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.350
There's a story in the New Testament,

355
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.670
and it illustrates everything I've been talking about this morning. It's,

356
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.310
it's the, it's the story of Paul and Silas. You remember this story?

357
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.790
It's in Acts chapter 16. And, and, and the story is this.

358
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.390
They've been out preaching the gospel.

359
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.310
There's opposition to the preaching of the gospel.

360
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.870
And so they're arrested, they're tried. They're, they're innocent,

361
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.870
but they're declared guilty. The the, it's a Trump charge.

362
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.830
They're beaten and then they're placed in an inner prison.

363
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.150
And there they chains are put around their,

364
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.630
their ankles and they're shackled to the wall.

365
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:44.140
It's midnight. And listen, unlike me and most of us,

366
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:49.060
they're not doing what we would do. They are praying.

367
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.620
The Bible says, and they are singing to God.

368
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.700
And it says that all the prisoners were listening.

369
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.700
And then at midnight, an earthquake shook the foundation of this prison.

370
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.100
And all the doors were broken open and the chains fell off.

371
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.050
The prisoners were freed.

372
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.730
The jailer comes in and he says, SIRS,

373
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.570
what must I do to be saved? And they turn to him and say,

374
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.170
believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.

375
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.290
You know, I read that story and thought about that story,

376
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.330
and that has been my prayer for us as a church.

377
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.130
That every Sunday we come in here and in our desperation,

378
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.800
we would lift up our prayers. We would stand in silence before God,

379
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.920
and we would sing our praises to God and that people would

380
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.880
hear, and that there would be an earthquake in here,

381
00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.960
and that change would be broken and doors would fly open and lies would be

382
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.520
changed. And Lord,

383
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:06.560
that the gospel would be heard and that people would surrender to Jesus as

384
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.280
their savior and Lord, amen. Amen.

385
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.600
I pray for that every Sunday.

386
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.800
Why not this Sunday? Why not today?

387
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.410
He's here. I'm here. You're here. The Spirit is here.

388
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.210
We live in victory because of what Christ has done

389
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.940
the other day. It's hot. And I don't have to remind you of that, right?

390
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:37.953
But the other day,

391
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.980
I just went outside in the darkness because it's cooler

392
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.380
and I just like being outside and I don't like hot.

393
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.900
And so I went outside and sat in the darkness.

394
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.180
You don't have to sit in the darkness outside, but, but let's just be honest.

395
00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.860
If you want to see stars at night,

396
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.020
darkness is required, right? It's just the way it works.

397
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.540
The stars, they don't require darkness.

398
00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:15.060
They don't even ask for darkness. In fact, the stars are shining all the time.

399
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.100
We could go outside right now and the stars are there.

400
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.380
They're doing what they do. We just can't see 'em.

401
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.380
We don't have to set in silence before the Lord during

402
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.420
these times in our life.

403
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.370
But

404
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.950
If you want to hear from God during these times,

405
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.470
silence is required.

406
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.930
Listen to Psalms 62 verse one.

407
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.210
For God, for God alone,

408
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.090
my soul waits

409
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.903
In silence.

410
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.230
We've learned. We've learned what David did.

411
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.220
David told us what we should do.

412
00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.920
But let me ask you something.

413
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.330
What will you do?
