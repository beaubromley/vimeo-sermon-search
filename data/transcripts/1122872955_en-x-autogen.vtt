00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:04.285
Good morning church.

2
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:08.445
Uh, this is, uh, a great day that we get to celebrate

3
00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:11.325
'cause we have Parker Robertson, who is a sixth grade boy,

4
00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.045
uh, getting baptized this morning.

5
00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:14.165
So praise God for that.

6
00:00:14.825 --> 00:00:18.685
Um, yeah, Yeah.

7
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.565
Just to give you a little bit about Parker's story,

8
00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:23.925
we were at kids camp together this past summer and

9
00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.965
after the first nights we were walking out

10
00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:27.845
and he shared with me that, uh,

11
00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.925
he wasn't really sure if he had a relationship with Jesus

12
00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.525
and he really wanted to.

13
00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:34.165
And so through that week we talked through that.

14
00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:39.045
And, uh, as the, uh, months have gone on, he has continued

15
00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.045
to have these conversations with his parents.

16
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.605
And so now he is ready to step forward

17
00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:45.805
and proclaim his faith to us.

18
00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.885
And so, uh, Parker, based on your confession

19
00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:51.005
of faith in Jesus Christ, I now get

20
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:52.965
to baptize you in the name of the Father Son

21
00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:53.885
and the Holy Spirit.
