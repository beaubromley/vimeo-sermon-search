WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.555 --> 00:00:02.605
Okay, week five.

2
00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:07.805
Um, thought I'd begin tonight by just seeing if anybody,

3
00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.445
um, would be willing to just share something

4
00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:17.125
that you got out of either week fives material

5
00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:18.325
or week four.

6
00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:24.085
Just anybody have a takeaway from either

7
00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:25.805
of those past two weeks?

8
00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.205
We're gonna go over the material in week five,

9
00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:33.605
somewhat tonight, but just in case, just kind of wondering

10
00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:37.965
what, if there's anything that's kind of speaking to you.

11
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:40.885
And no shame if there isn't. Uh,

12
00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:44.005
We, we five. That's the week we're

13
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:45.565
On now, right? Yes. Yeah. It

14
00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:48.165
Didn't seem like it really flowed the way the other

15
00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:50.085
lessons have, at least to us.

16
00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.765
Yeah. It seemed like it jumped around a lot.

17
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.925
It actually has two major focus,

18
00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.165
or folk, I, whatever you, however you say that.

19
00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:06.525
Um, one being condemnation, emptying your cups

20
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:07.565
of condemnation.

21
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.645
And then the other is sexual intimacy in marriage.

22
00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:15.725
So that might have been part of that. Well, not sure. There

23
00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:18.525
Was I think two days

24
00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:21.045
and sexual intimacy was right in the middle.

25
00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.125
And then we go up and pick up another topic.

26
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:26.285
Yeah. Yeah. It, it kind of does that.

27
00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:29.525
I think this is the first time it's really had two major

28
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:30.685
topics, Uhhuh,

29
00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:35.845
but, um, it always has some days that are more about, uh,

30
00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:39.725
your, your relationship or, uh, intimacy with Jesus.

31
00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:44.085
Um, and then other days that are more specifically on

32
00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.605
a relationship as a couple, so

33
00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.125
that there's a little bouncing around

34
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.485
that's intentional every week.

35
00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:54.005
But I think it probably added to that

36
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.525
because they had two days on sexual intimacy

37
00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:59.285
and two days on, or three

38
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.765
or four days that would've been on condemnation.

39
00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:06.045
So I'm, I'm gonna try to cover both of those areas. Okay.

40
00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:11.125
Uh, before I do that, anybody else want to share anything?

41
00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:14.445
I like the, go ahead.

42
00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:18.885
I like the thought in, um, the one Corinthians 13

43
00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:22.005
and changing out the name, our names for love.

44
00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:24.445
Yeah. I actually took that and wrote it on our mirror

45
00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:26.605
because that made an impact for me.

46
00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.605
I feel like that was something that I could kind

47
00:02:28.605 --> 00:02:30.805
of grab hold of and kind

48
00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:34.125
of remind myself throughout the day, am I doing this

49
00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:35.645
Good? So

50
00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:37.605
I, I really enjoyed that part of it.

51
00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:41.455
Yeah. If I could build off that, um,

52
00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:45.535
uh, back when I was a younger man

53
00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:47.655
and had hair, uh, I was in seminary

54
00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:51.255
and I, I took a class on spiritual formation, which was

55
00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:54.775
probably my most memorable class of three years

56
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.375
of schooling there.

57
00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:01.965
And, uh, one of the things that the, uh, professor

58
00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:06.485
of that class did was, he had us go through Psalms

59
00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:10.765
on our own, but he said, replace your name,

60
00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:15.965
um, as if you're David writing those psalms.

61
00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:19.565
So read it or even read it out loud,

62
00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:22.565
but personalize it, make it first person.

63
00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:26.405
And that really did make a difference.

64
00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:29.925
And you reminded me of that as you said that, so

65
00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:32.885
Very good, very good way to apply that.

66
00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:36.275
Anybody else?

67
00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:39.805
I was gonna say back to week four, so one

68
00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:42.405
of the things I've struggled with for 20 plus years

69
00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:46.565
of marriage is the trying to fix everything.

70
00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:48.405
Right? Like, that's my job. Mm-Hmm.

71
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.405
Day to day, that's what I do. I'm a fixer.

72
00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:53.125
I I manage things and have done it for years and years.

73
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.725
And so it's really hard for me to just sit and listen

74
00:03:57.145 --> 00:04:00.525
and sit and mourn with her and Mm-Hmm.

75
00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:03.805
You know, feel her feelings when that's not

76
00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:05.085
what she wants for sure.

77
00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:07.565
But even more, that's not what she needs. Mm-Hmm.

78
00:04:07.645 --> 00:04:10.525
And so we, we had a really good conversation on, okay,

79
00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:12.045
how do I get them past that?

80
00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.445
And, you know,

81
00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.045
because there's still that time as we talked, even

82
00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:20.365
for weeks on the, um, uh, you know, speaking the truth

83
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:21.405
and love Mm-Hmm.

84
00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:24.725
And, you know, it's, I still find myself challenging

85
00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:26.525
to bite my tongue and,

86
00:04:26.545 --> 00:04:28.965
and hopefully getting to the point of I'm not having

87
00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:30.725
to fight that in my own mind

88
00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:35.205
because I'm already seeing that's not even what I should be

89
00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:37.525
focusing on to begin with. Mm-Hmm.

90
00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:40.205
And that's a great takeaway.

91
00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:46.205
Uh, high five, right, Carrie? Uh, very helpful. Yes.

92
00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:50.165
Yeah. And it's, uh, it is so common,

93
00:04:51.105 --> 00:04:52.805
not exclusively to men,

94
00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:57.965
but probably more likely that we'll see ourselves

95
00:04:58.025 --> 00:05:01.245
as fixers and doers and so forth.

96
00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.165
Well, I think we also, I mean, the question

97
00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:07.365
that you asked me, 'cause he was like, how do I know when

98
00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:09.965
to say I think you should do this

99
00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:11.525
versus, I'm just gonna listen.

100
00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:15.245
So we had a whole discussion on like, what would

101
00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:16.485
that look like, Uhhuh, like

102
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.285
Did you, did you figure that Out?

103
00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:19.645
Yeah, we decided we'd come up with like,

104
00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:21.165
just continue these meetings.

105
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.245
Like, that would be the time that I'm saying, Hey,

106
00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:25.845
I need you to help me fix this, versus I just need you

107
00:05:25.845 --> 00:05:26.845
To listen.

108
00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:30.405
And I mean, just verbally saying that instead

109
00:05:30.405 --> 00:05:32.525
of having expectations or Yeah.

110
00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:34.565
Um, not feeling heard,

111
00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:38.245
but just, um, so he knows too, like, how,

112
00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:39.725
how can he help me in that way?

113
00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:40.805
And how can I help him? And

114
00:05:40.805 --> 00:05:42.445
how can we communicate better things?

115
00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:43.605
Yeah. It was really good.

116
00:05:45.105 --> 00:05:46.925
You know, uh, the mentor

117
00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:51.405
that you've seen David Ferguson on these, uh, videos, uh,

118
00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:56.285
helped us, uh, also see that

119
00:05:56.465 --> 00:06:00.485
as almost a general problem in our culture as well

120
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.405
as most cultures in the world, which is we have a being

121
00:06:03.955 --> 00:06:06.245
with issue.

122
00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:12.285
We struggle to be with people where we're really connecting

123
00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:15.845
emotionally, psychologically, relationally.

124
00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:20.605
So we can do things and we can fix problems

125
00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:22.285
and that kind of deal.

126
00:06:22.385 --> 00:06:26.965
But it is hard, especially if that wasn't part of

127
00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:30.765
what you experienced on a regular daily, weekly basis

128
00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:32.645
in your young years.

129
00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:35.245
'cause that's where you're just absorbing everything,

130
00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:37.565
whatever's there is what you're absorbing.

131
00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:40.485
Right. In my home, as I've said

132
00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:44.485
before, it was overall very good family and very stable

133
00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:47.245
and all that, but we did not

134
00:06:48.435 --> 00:06:50.045
discuss emotions ever

135
00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:53.445
just wasn't on the agenda.

136
00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:57.725
So you learn by experience.

137
00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:00.845
Um, if I'm feeling something I'm,

138
00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:03.445
maybe I shouldn't be feeling something, you know?

139
00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:06.205
So you just learn to not communicate it.

140
00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:11.165
Uh, and definitely if somebody starts crying

141
00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:16.565
in my presence and I'm married to her, if that were

142
00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:19.245
to happen, that makes me doubly anxious

143
00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:23.445
because now that looks like a problem to me.

144
00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:27.045
And in a way it is. But I just had

145
00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:28.405
to learn the very same thing.

146
00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:33.165
And my mid forties was the best thing to do is

147
00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:38.005
what the Bible says to do, which is be with her hurting,

148
00:07:38.035 --> 00:07:41.845
with her mourning, with her tuning in

149
00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:44.645
with her emotions rather than trying

150
00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:47.485
to take it somewhere else as a diversion.

151
00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:50.965
If I could add one thing, we, we, uh,

152
00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:54.685
we were talking earlier about a, um, a train we had earlier,

153
00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:56.685
and one of the things that came up was that

154
00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:00.685
the opposite almost of being with is being around.

155
00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:04.325
And I think so often we kind of put into our minds

156
00:08:04.325 --> 00:08:06.965
what we're with them, but we're not, we're just around them.

157
00:08:07.865 --> 00:08:10.765
And, uh, you know, keeping that as a mindset of that has

158
00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:13.125
to be the difference of I'm not just

159
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:15.445
around you, I'm with you.

160
00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.885
Yeah. And what the different things that can mean Yeah.

161
00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:20.005
And how we do that. So

162
00:08:20.755 --> 00:08:21.755
Yeah. Even if we just think

163
00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:25.165
about something that's not sinful,

164
00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:27.845
unless you're watching really bad stuff or something,

165
00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:31.125
but if you're watching TV together, that's not a bad thing.

166
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:34.445
Right. Uh, we had a great time watching

167
00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:37.565
sports this weekend together,

168
00:08:38.825 --> 00:08:43.725
but that rarely accomplishes being with That's good,

169
00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:45.525
but it's not the same.

170
00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:50.845
And we need this be with me, see my heart, understand me,

171
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:56.045
um, be, be, um,

172
00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:00.205
caring for me rather than managing me.

173
00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:04.725
So, good takeaways. Yeah.

174
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:08.445
If you've got nothing outta this class, then that, uh,

175
00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:12.765
that would probably, uh, be a great investment

176
00:09:12.865 --> 00:09:17.005
of your time already. Anybody else?

177
00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:19.245
I would add that, say that.

178
00:09:19.885 --> 00:09:23.565
I would say had to, but, um, connect with that in the sense

179
00:09:23.565 --> 00:09:25.925
that in my childhood growing up,

180
00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:27.325
my parents divorced when I was young,

181
00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:28.485
and then they remarried later on

182
00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:31.765
and out of, so I don't remember

183
00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:33.525
as much from the early childhood

184
00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:36.205
and it wasn't a healthy spot anyways,

185
00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:40.805
but the older marriages, the best out of both

186
00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:44.085
of those was the marriage where my stepfather said that

187
00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:47.445
he liked my, my mom being with,

188
00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:51.205
and he just met in the same household, Uhhuh with her.

189
00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:52.965
And so that was the closest thing

190
00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:54.565
that I saw for the most part.

191
00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:56.365
Yeah. To connection. Yeah.

192
00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:59.325
Uh, other than occasionally we would go on a family vacation

193
00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:03.885
or something like that, but, um, it was like, that was what,

194
00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:08.165
that was the depth of what he under it seemed to me like.

195
00:10:08.165 --> 00:10:09.925
Mm-Hmm. From my view at least, that

196
00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:11.045
that was probably the depth of

197
00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:12.685
what he understood of being with.

198
00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:15.845
Right. Um, and he was on his third marriage

199
00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:17.645
and different things, but yeah.

200
00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:21.605
Um, so I don't think that I really, and I,

201
00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:22.845
and I've talked to my wife about that.

202
00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:24.885
I like her being with me Mm-Hmm.

203
00:10:25.035 --> 00:10:27.045
With different activities where they're working on something

204
00:10:27.045 --> 00:10:28.805
or playing or vacation or whatever.

205
00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:30.325
I don't care. I like her being with me.

206
00:10:31.305 --> 00:10:34.525
Um, but I would like the more also mm-Hmm.

207
00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:37.445
So, but anyways, it's just interesting

208
00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:42.525
when you haven't seen the other, it's hard to, it's hard to

209
00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:45.325
figure out how to get to something you've never

210
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:46.525
really understood.

211
00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:47.745
So. Mm-Hmm.

212
00:10:48.825 --> 00:10:50.955
That's really good. Yeah.

213
00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:53.555
I bet you there's others in the room

214
00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:56.435
that could probably relate directly to some of

215
00:10:56.435 --> 00:10:58.035
that in different details. But,

216
00:10:58.615 --> 00:11:03.155
Uh, and for that he needs your comfort that he never got.

217
00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:06.715
Would you would like to as see you?

218
00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:11.755
So I'm just gonna repeat what Joyce said, make sure

219
00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:16.435
that it's picked up on here, that that's any time

220
00:11:17.605 --> 00:11:21.595
needs that God wanted met for us growing up, such as empathy

221
00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:24.555
and compassion, comfort, encouragement,

222
00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:29.275
if those weren't met, that's another memory

223
00:11:30.105 --> 00:11:32.915
that may be waiting for some of God's comfort.

224
00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:37.035
And his comfort is not a pep talk. It is.

225
00:11:37.555 --> 00:11:40.075
I care that you did not have that,

226
00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:42.935
and maybe even,

227
00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:47.175
and I think I can even try harder to give that

228
00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:49.135
to you as we go forward.

229
00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:51.775
In other words, I'm gonna learn from

230
00:11:51.775 --> 00:11:52.935
this if I haven't already.

231
00:11:53.435 --> 00:11:56.005
Hope for the future. Hope for the future. Yeah.

232
00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.845
Um, one of the things that's implied in many

233
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:05.525
of these weeks is, uh, the need that we might have

234
00:12:05.665 --> 00:12:07.365
for change or growth

235
00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:10.685
in our ability to love.

236
00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:12.085
Well, okay.

237
00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:13.605
And I sure hope, in fact,

238
00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:15.205
we're gonna talk about condemnation night.

239
00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:17.405
Don't be going around beating yourself up.

240
00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:20.485
Especially if it wasn't like, well,

241
00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:22.765
I just don't really think I care and

242
00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:25.485
therefore I'm just not going to give to this relationship.

243
00:12:26.115 --> 00:12:27.565
That would be more of an attitude

244
00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:28.965
that needs changing, right?

245
00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:33.205
Mm-Hmm. But oftentimes it's inadequacy. Join the club.

246
00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:36.565
Um, even

247
00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:39.765
after I was trained to be a counselor, I had not learned how

248
00:12:39.765 --> 00:12:42.645
to, uh, communicate with my wife's heart.

249
00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:44.925
Now that's really scary.

250
00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:46.925
If you're her, you know,

251
00:12:46.955 --> 00:12:48.685
he's even got a counseling degree now,

252
00:12:49.545 --> 00:12:51.845
and I still wasn't communicating with her heart.

253
00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:57.485
And, uh, there was a need for awareness

254
00:12:58.075 --> 00:12:59.205
that I need to grow.

255
00:12:59.385 --> 00:13:03.285
And secondly, there was a need for effort to make

256
00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:06.285
that growth, to kind of get on board with

257
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:07.445
what the Lord was doing.

258
00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:11.085
So, more good comments.

259
00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:15.925
So realize this, this bless you, this comfort thing,

260
00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:21.045
uh, which is so foreign to many of us as far as

261
00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:22.245
what we were exposed to

262
00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:25.525
or what we've experienced, even sometimes in marriage,

263
00:13:26.115 --> 00:13:27.965
like we had not experienced it.

264
00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:32.805
Um, this is almost a daily opportunity,

265
00:13:32.985 --> 00:13:34.125
either in marriage

266
00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:36.685
or in other encounters you have

267
00:13:36.685 --> 00:13:37.925
with other people during the day.

268
00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:40.725
It's all around us of people or hurting.

269
00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:45.645
So we just want to equip the saints for the work of

270
00:13:45.715 --> 00:13:48.005
that ministry starting at home,

271
00:13:48.785 --> 00:13:51.285
and then be ready for the people around you.

272
00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:56.325
So, okay, let me pray for us,

273
00:13:56.385 --> 00:13:59.445
and then I'm gonna give you a little talking

274
00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:00.845
assignment as a couple.

275
00:14:02.105 --> 00:14:05.565
Father, be with us today, uh, as we just continue

276
00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:09.245
to reflect on the word, the instruction, the guidance

277
00:14:09.275 --> 00:14:12.485
that you have given us about how to love, like Jesus loves,

278
00:14:13.465 --> 00:14:17.805
uh, how to give first and, um,

279
00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:22.445
and speak truth in love,

280
00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:26.925
but also, um, create safe places

281
00:14:27.185 --> 00:14:30.725
for our spouses to share with us what they're thinking,

282
00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:32.405
what they're feeling, what they're needing.

283
00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:37.045
Um, and we know your, your Holy Spirit

284
00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.085
is already active in us

285
00:14:42.195 --> 00:14:44.285
because it's, it's a gift from you.

286
00:14:45.025 --> 00:14:47.965
So let us just respond to the nudges

287
00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:50.565
that we get from the Spirit in Jesus' name.

288
00:14:50.835 --> 00:14:54.965
Amen. So, um,

289
00:14:58.745 --> 00:15:02.365
uh, Couple of thoughts.

290
00:15:02.365 --> 00:15:04.165
We're gonna talk about condemnation first.

291
00:15:05.265 --> 00:15:09.245
And, um, I'm gonna show you a

292
00:15:10.015 --> 00:15:13.685
video of Dr. Ferguson doing another meditation.

293
00:15:14.235 --> 00:15:17.405
Okay? This one's coming out of Romans eight,

294
00:15:19.105 --> 00:15:22.205
so you'll probably be very familiar with the verse.

295
00:15:22.425 --> 00:15:25.845
Romans eight, one that says, there is now,

296
00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:29.565
therefore no condemnation

297
00:15:30.185 --> 00:15:31.605
for those who are in Christ Jesus.

298
00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:35.325
Basically saying, if you have put your trust in Christ,

299
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.685
received him into your heart, um,

300
00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.325
he has made an eternal home for you

301
00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:47.525
that he is not the one responsible it for you.

302
00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:50.245
Feeling condemnation if you're still feeling it.

303
00:15:50.755 --> 00:15:53.325
It's not coming from him. According to that verse.

304
00:15:54.355 --> 00:15:58.205
It's coming from tapes, memories, patterns

305
00:15:58.205 --> 00:16:00.925
of thoughts that you may have had.

306
00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:06.285
And it's not coming from him, but they may still be there.

307
00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:11.005
And we would love for them to not be there to

308
00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:13.325
where those thoughts, those feelings

309
00:16:13.325 --> 00:16:16.125
that come from those thoughts are not haunting

310
00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:18.645
you on a regular basis. If that makes sense.

311
00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:20.285
Can I add something? Sure.

312
00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:24.725
And for a long time, until I understood what condemnation,

313
00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:29.885
how it could come into our lives, yours came from me.

314
00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:33.765
What you might, you might also say what you mean. Yeah.

315
00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:37.485
Well, like, I was quite, I was never satisfied,

316
00:16:37.905 --> 00:16:40.125
or you got home too late again,

317
00:16:40.665 --> 00:16:42.405
or, you know, stuff like that.

318
00:16:43.185 --> 00:16:45.445
And that just makes you feel inadequate.

319
00:16:46.555 --> 00:16:50.325
Yeah. And we, we had that awareness of

320
00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:51.485
that part of our dynamic.

321
00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:55.565
At that same point in our relationship, about 19 years in,

322
00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:57.685
we were both about 45.

323
00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:02.725
And then I think I've already shared how I would leave her

324
00:17:03.515 --> 00:17:05.285
needing to talk and I'd be saying,

325
00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:08.805
don't have time or something like that.

326
00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:10.165
I was leaving her abandoned.

327
00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:13.605
So we both had things that we were coming to be aware of.

328
00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:17.285
And, uh, but it wouldn't have helped

329
00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:23.605
if I continue to scratch that sore on her arm,

330
00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:27.005
or she continues to step on the bruise

331
00:17:27.835 --> 00:17:30.685
that I have from the condemnation I got growing up.

332
00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:32.645
So coming to be aware of that,

333
00:17:32.665 --> 00:17:36.725
and then having tools for how do we respond instead. So,

334
00:17:37.585 --> 00:17:40.245
And it helps to know the personality

335
00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:42.045
of your spouse versus you.

336
00:17:42.805 --> 00:17:44.285
'cause like, I didn't gather

337
00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:46.765
as much condemnation from my parents

338
00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:49.525
because when my mom would say, oh, you can't do that,

339
00:17:49.885 --> 00:17:51.565
I would say, well, you just hide and watch.

340
00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:55.725
Yeah. Have you noticed a little personality difference

341
00:17:55.725 --> 00:17:57.765
between you bet

342
00:17:58.675 --> 00:18:01.765
That you, you would go, oh gosh, I will never

343
00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:04.405
satisfy her.

344
00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:07.325
She'll never tell me she loves me. You know?

345
00:18:07.425 --> 00:18:09.965
So sometimes there's personality differences.

346
00:18:10.315 --> 00:18:13.125
Yeah. That factors in as well. For sure.

347
00:18:14.225 --> 00:18:18.885
So, um, that verse,

348
00:18:19.225 --> 00:18:20.525
Romans eight one, there's now

349
00:18:20.525 --> 00:18:22.725
therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ.

350
00:18:22.725 --> 00:18:26.205
Jesus is a, is a declaration of God's truth.

351
00:18:26.745 --> 00:18:29.725
It is true for every single believer.

352
00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:34.245
But on the other hand, that verse in Romans, it says,

353
00:18:34.975 --> 00:18:37.725
don't conform any longer to the patterns of this world,

354
00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:38.965
but be transformed.

355
00:18:39.145 --> 00:18:41.765
How? By the renewing of your mind

356
00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:45.565
do you realize the renewing of your mind is not just

357
00:18:45.715 --> 00:18:49.325
what you think, it's healing of what you feel

358
00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:54.125
that's real important is that's all part of your mind.

359
00:18:54.715 --> 00:18:59.525
Okay? So what you think is very likely

360
00:19:01.535 --> 00:19:03.765
triggering either good emotion

361
00:19:03.905 --> 00:19:06.565
or bad emotion, depending upon what you're thinking.

362
00:19:07.475 --> 00:19:11.655
And so we'd say, well, if I am continuing

363
00:19:11.655 --> 00:19:14.375
to tell myself I'm stupid,

364
00:19:15.745 --> 00:19:19.815
which was part of my vocabulary for myself for years,

365
00:19:21.435 --> 00:19:26.055
I'm stupid, and I actually took that to heart

366
00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:29.655
so I would feel bad.

367
00:19:30.355 --> 00:19:32.255
Mm-Hmm. I'd feel condemned.

368
00:19:34.155 --> 00:19:36.175
And do you think that influenced my behavior?

369
00:19:37.235 --> 00:19:41.775
You better believe it. And that was not coming from God.

370
00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:46.695
He would've been saying, you may not be the smartest cookie

371
00:19:46.795 --> 00:19:50.215
on the block, but you're not stupid.

372
00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:54.295
That's not what I, God would call you.

373
00:19:55.575 --> 00:19:59.575
I would start with, you're my beloved son, along

374
00:19:59.775 --> 00:20:03.215
with a bunch of others, but you are one of my beloved.

375
00:20:03.645 --> 00:20:06.895
Okay? So let's watch this video.

376
00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:10.855
And it's actually referring to the latter part

377
00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:13.295
of Romans eight, where

378
00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:17.415
the Apostle Paul wrote

379
00:20:18.195 --> 00:20:21.295
as if he was describing a legal courtroom.

380
00:20:22.035 --> 00:20:25.295
The terminology is almost like that of a courtroom.

381
00:20:27.315 --> 00:20:30.255
So I'm gonna let David be the one that does that for you.

382
00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:32.455
See if I can pull that up now.

383
00:20:35.475 --> 00:20:37.575
I'm sorry, I lost

384
00:20:37.635 --> 00:20:42.135
my there.

385
00:20:42.135 --> 00:20:43.135
It's,

386
00:20:43.665 --> 00:20:44.665
There we go.

387
00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:54.565
It's not gonna work. This is

388
00:20:54.565 --> 00:20:55.805
about three minutes long.

389
00:20:58.315 --> 00:21:00.285
There's a very mysterious, uh,

390
00:21:00.285 --> 00:21:02.245
passage in Romans chapter eight.

391
00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:05.965
It talks about there is no condemnation for those of us

392
00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:07.125
who are in Christ Jesus.

393
00:21:08.025 --> 00:21:11.165
So one of the challenges that we find in life today is how

394
00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:12.325
to experience more

395
00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:14.605
and more freedom from those self-doubts,

396
00:21:14.605 --> 00:21:16.845
from those self condemning thoughts.

397
00:21:17.305 --> 00:21:21.045
And one of the ways to do that is to really, um, deal with

398
00:21:21.465 --> 00:21:24.965
who is it that can bring charge or condemnation toward us?

399
00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:27.845
Too often in our day to day, we would say kind of anybody

400
00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:30.805
and everybody who could, uh, you know, criticize me,

401
00:21:30.815 --> 00:21:32.085
judge me, compared me.

402
00:21:32.085 --> 00:21:33.805
Particularly in this world of social media

403
00:21:34.265 --> 00:21:36.845
and all the comparisons that are happening out there today.

404
00:21:37.075 --> 00:21:40.765
It's so easy to reinforce this condemnation, self blame

405
00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:44.525
as comparisons are made, you see that power

406
00:21:45.265 --> 00:21:47.885
of bringing charge has been given to the one Jesus Christ.

407
00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:51.085
But the passage says, it's that one Jesus who's lived,

408
00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:52.365
whose died, has been raised

409
00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:55.325
and is now beautiful, present tense word, now

410
00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:57.125
interceding for you.

411
00:21:58.305 --> 00:22:00.045
Now that needs to bring a smile to your face,

412
00:22:00.075 --> 00:22:01.085
that only one person

413
00:22:01.105 --> 00:22:03.565
who can bring charge against you is praying for you.

414
00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:06.405
And so, in just a moment, we're gonna meditate on

415
00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:07.685
that kind of praying, Jesus.

416
00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:10.365
And the scene that we're gonna allow the Holy Spirit

417
00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:12.165
to paint inside of our hearts

418
00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.765
and minds is the scene of a courtroom.

419
00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:15.965
And so the imagery here is, of you

420
00:22:15.965 --> 00:22:18.165
and I walking alone into

421
00:22:18.945 --> 00:22:22.445
an unfriendly courtroom, would you bow with me?

422
00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:25.125
And let's do that. Heavenly Father, uh,

423
00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:27.565
we pray in these moments, there would be a fresh work

424
00:22:27.565 --> 00:22:30.645
of the Holy Spirit to bring freedom from condemnation.

425
00:22:31.135 --> 00:22:32.645
Would you imagine yourself walking

426
00:22:32.675 --> 00:22:33.925
into a courtroom all alone?

427
00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:36.365
You notice unfriendly faces are there,

428
00:22:36.495 --> 00:22:38.405
there are people there who in the past have

429
00:22:38.405 --> 00:22:39.645
judged or criticized you.

430
00:22:40.065 --> 00:22:41.245
And now your uncertainty

431
00:22:41.245 --> 00:22:43.925
and anxiety is even further increased.

432
00:22:44.545 --> 00:22:47.445
But who is it really that can bring charge against you?

433
00:22:47.815 --> 00:22:49.645
Would you imagine? Right now into

434
00:22:49.645 --> 00:22:53.085
that courtroom walks Jesus Christ, he walks right into

435
00:22:53.085 --> 00:22:55.325
that courtroom, puts his arm gently around you.

436
00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:58.245
He begins to pray for you, begins to pray for the needs

437
00:22:58.245 --> 00:22:59.765
of your life, the burdens of your heart.

438
00:23:00.795 --> 00:23:02.325
He's praying your prayer list.

439
00:23:02.895 --> 00:23:05.645
Allow the Holy Spirit to touch you with the wonder

440
00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:09.005
of a praying Jesus who is so attentive, so knowing of you

441
00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:11.365
that he is praying specifically

442
00:23:11.385 --> 00:23:12.845
for the burdens and needs of your life.

443
00:23:13.465 --> 00:23:14.885
And as you hear him pray,

444
00:23:14.895 --> 00:23:17.485
would you imagine he whispers these words to you?

445
00:23:18.255 --> 00:23:20.325
Where are your accusers?

446
00:23:21.705 --> 00:23:23.245
And you open your eyes to look around

447
00:23:23.245 --> 00:23:25.085
and all those unfriendly faces are gone.

448
00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:27.125
And Jesus continues to pray.

449
00:23:28.385 --> 00:23:32.325
And he prays these words, neither do I accuse you.

450
00:23:33.255 --> 00:23:35.765
Would you allow the Holy Spirit to use that truth

451
00:23:36.305 --> 00:23:40.345
to cast out any, any seeds of condemnation, any threads

452
00:23:40.345 --> 00:23:41.665
of condemnation in your heart?

453
00:23:41.805 --> 00:23:43.705
Any self-blame self-criticism?

454
00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:47.605
Neither do I accuse you.

455
00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:51.395
Take some time now to continue your Jesus story.

456
00:23:52.085 --> 00:23:53.435
First, listen to his voice

457
00:23:54.095 --> 00:23:56.995
and hear what he wants to say just for you.

458
00:23:57.895 --> 00:23:59.235
And after you've heard from him,

459
00:23:59.545 --> 00:24:01.155
respond back to him in a personal way.

460
00:24:01.705 --> 00:24:04.075
Tell Jesus what's on your mind.

461
00:24:38.655 --> 00:24:41.085
Allow the Holy Spirit to take this truth

462
00:24:41.265 --> 00:24:45.045
of a praying Jesus deeply into your heart, that

463
00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:48.565
that freedom might bring forth joy and wonder

464
00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:52.045
and gratitude that it might lead to more

465
00:24:52.045 --> 00:24:53.845
and more life abundant.

466
00:24:53.905 --> 00:24:57.805
Do that we ask Jesus, even now, amen. And amen.

467
00:25:08.935 --> 00:25:12.085
Experience more and more freedom from those self doubts,

468
00:25:12.085 --> 00:25:14.325
from those self condemning thoughts.

469
00:25:15.315 --> 00:25:19.765
Okay? So in just a minute, I'm going to let you share

470
00:25:19.765 --> 00:25:23.325
with your spouse maybe what came to your thoughts

471
00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:26.645
as you were listening to the meditation

472
00:25:26.705 --> 00:25:28.165
or even hearing from the Lord.

473
00:25:29.465 --> 00:25:32.565
Um, and remember that some

474
00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:35.725
of you might have experienced something very good during

475
00:25:35.755 --> 00:25:39.245
that time and that would be caused to

476
00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:41.565
rejoice with him.

477
00:25:42.945 --> 00:25:46.365
And some of you may have simply been reminded of some

478
00:25:46.365 --> 00:25:48.525
of the hurt that you had experienced

479
00:25:48.585 --> 00:25:51.085
and that would call for compassion.

480
00:25:51.965 --> 00:25:56.855
I care that you might still be dealing with some of

481
00:25:56.855 --> 00:26:01.695
that and want you to know that I would not want to be

482
00:26:02.635 --> 00:26:05.775
adding any condemnation to you.

483
00:26:07.285 --> 00:26:09.945
So I want to, uh, give you, uh,

484
00:26:12.095 --> 00:26:14.305
some verses that I have found very helpful.

485
00:26:15.405 --> 00:26:19.985
Uh, I think there's enough of, for one, for everybody on

486
00:26:19.985 --> 00:26:20.905
This one. So

487
00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:23.105
I encourage You to go ahead and take one.

488
00:26:23.895 --> 00:26:25.985
I've got some verses some things on the back,

489
00:26:26.045 --> 00:26:28.625
but I'm not going to be using that now.

490
00:26:30.165 --> 00:26:33.745
But, um, four verses that

491
00:26:35.275 --> 00:26:37.345
we'll just give you some additional

492
00:26:37.435 --> 00:26:40.785
truth to reflect on.

493
00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:50.365
You know, it's one thing to try to stop

494
00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:53.925
tapes from playing in my head

495
00:26:54.185 --> 00:26:58.325
or my own voice, uh, judging me in

496
00:26:59.525 --> 00:27:00.565
critical harsh ways.

497
00:27:01.785 --> 00:27:05.325
Um, keeping in mind that some of the most common ways

498
00:27:05.475 --> 00:27:08.165
that a sense of I'm not enough

499
00:27:09.065 --> 00:27:11.845
or, uh, I'm unlovable

500
00:27:12.465 --> 00:27:14.885
or anything in that direction.

501
00:27:15.145 --> 00:27:17.645
I'm stupid, I'm foolish, I'm a mess up.

502
00:27:18.945 --> 00:27:20.405
All of those kinds of things.

503
00:27:21.595 --> 00:27:23.485
Many times they have come from

504
00:27:25.235 --> 00:27:27.165
extreme criticism in childhood.

505
00:27:27.745 --> 00:27:30.005
That's where the seeds got planted.

506
00:27:30.095 --> 00:27:32.045
We're not trying to blame everything on parents.

507
00:27:32.755 --> 00:27:34.085
That could have come from bullies.

508
00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.445
That could have come from people rejecting you

509
00:27:36.445 --> 00:27:38.525
because you look different than they did,

510
00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:40.885
or you were a nerd and they weren't.

511
00:27:41.265 --> 00:27:42.765
Uh, all kinds of things.

512
00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:45.805
But it often comes from extreme criticism.

513
00:27:45.905 --> 00:27:47.885
It also can come from extreme neglect,

514
00:27:48.945 --> 00:27:50.935
which is a little harder to spot sometimes.

515
00:27:51.115 --> 00:27:53.055
But if you have legitimate God ordained needs

516
00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:54.095
and they're not being

517
00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:58.215
provided for a need for security, for example, if

518
00:27:58.215 --> 00:28:01.855
that's not being provided, that's a form of something good

519
00:28:01.855 --> 00:28:05.495
that God wants you to have, but it was not being provided.

520
00:28:05.755 --> 00:28:07.615
And it's essentially neglect.

521
00:28:08.245 --> 00:28:09.895
It's a need that's going unmet.

522
00:28:11.115 --> 00:28:14.455
Um, so there's a lot of things.

523
00:28:14.645 --> 00:28:19.095
Obviously abuse of any kind can contribute to a sense

524
00:28:19.095 --> 00:28:21.455
of worthlessness or a sense of being unworthy,

525
00:28:22.275 --> 00:28:24.135
uh, not valued.

526
00:28:25.275 --> 00:28:26.535
Um, so,

527
00:28:26.795 --> 00:28:30.855
and keep in mind, um, that

528
00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:34.935
is not something God is calling you.

529
00:28:35.675 --> 00:28:39.655
Do any of us deserve Jesus down on the cross?

530
00:28:39.655 --> 00:28:42.415
First I'd say, no, we don't, we didn't do anything

531
00:28:42.475 --> 00:28:44.935
or couldn't do anything to deserve that.

532
00:28:45.195 --> 00:28:49.655
But God is not the one saying, you're not worth loving

533
00:28:49.655 --> 00:28:51.015
because he loved us first.

534
00:28:51.315 --> 00:28:52.575
That's proof. Okay.

535
00:28:52.835 --> 00:28:55.735
So these are the verses we love because he first loved us.

536
00:28:56.715 --> 00:29:01.175
Um, he didn't wait for you to perform before he loved you.

537
00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:05.895
'cause Romans five, eight says that he actually,

538
00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:10.055
while we were still sinners, was choosing to send his son

539
00:29:10.055 --> 00:29:11.455
to a cross to die for us.

540
00:29:12.045 --> 00:29:15.295
There's your proof that you weren't, you weren't,

541
00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:17.255
he wasn't waiting for you to perform.

542
00:29:17.805 --> 00:29:20.855
Okay. My favorite verse, one

543
00:29:20.855 --> 00:29:23.015
of my favorite verses is Zephaniah three 17,

544
00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:24.695
the Lord your God is with you.

545
00:29:25.675 --> 00:29:27.655
The mighty warrior who saves,

546
00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:31.375
he will take great, what's that word?

547
00:29:32.245 --> 00:29:34.455
Delight in

548
00:29:34.455 --> 00:29:37.655
you, in his love.

549
00:29:37.835 --> 00:29:39.615
He will no longer rebuke you,

550
00:29:41.065 --> 00:29:45.705
but he will rejoice over you with singing one

551
00:29:45.805 --> 00:29:46.985
of the translations.

552
00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:48.625
Not this particular one.

553
00:29:49.605 --> 00:29:52.185
You, uh, phrases one of those sentences

554
00:29:52.285 --> 00:29:54.625
as he will calm you with his love.

555
00:29:56.825 --> 00:29:59.745
I love that. It's kind like when I'm all, I'm all

556
00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:03.745
stressed out, he's saying, I got this.

557
00:30:04.325 --> 00:30:06.345
Here's another one that says that he will quiet

558
00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:08.265
You with, quiet you with his love. Thank you. Which

559
00:30:08.265 --> 00:30:09.785
Means like, I can just imagine you,

560
00:30:09.845 --> 00:30:12.305
you're projecting all this condemnation on yourself, right?

561
00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:14.385
Yeah. Talking yourself instead of preaching to yourself.

562
00:30:14.405 --> 00:30:17.905
Yes. And now, and then he quiets you Yeah. With his love.

563
00:30:18.005 --> 00:30:19.985
You know, that's just so overwhelmed

564
00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:21.945
and overpowers all that condemnation, right?

565
00:30:21.975 --> 00:30:26.065
Yeah. With the, the words Romans eight, one. Yeah.

566
00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:27.145
For instance, or something else

567
00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:29.465
that when you start preaching to yourself Yeah.

568
00:30:29.465 --> 00:30:30.585
Instead of listening to

569
00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:31.705
Yourself. I love that. Yeah.

570
00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:34.225
I had not ever heard that particular

571
00:30:34.855 --> 00:30:37.585
application, but I I totally agree with it.

572
00:30:38.175 --> 00:30:40.545
Yeah. His love. And it's with his love.

573
00:30:41.935 --> 00:30:44.225
He's just saying, I got this. We're good.

574
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:48.345
We're gonna make it. Okay. Sure.

575
00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:49.505
To goodness and mercy

576
00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:52.785
or love will follow me all the days of my life.

577
00:30:52.785 --> 00:30:54.265
And I will go on the house of the Lord.

578
00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:57.945
It's that, I think I might have mentioned this the previous

579
00:30:57.945 --> 00:30:59.865
week, but he's following you.

580
00:31:00.175 --> 00:31:01.385
He's not waiting for you.

581
00:31:02.725 --> 00:31:07.145
And then, uh, the passage in John nine

582
00:31:08.695 --> 00:31:09.825
that says he went

583
00:31:09.835 --> 00:31:12.145
after the one who had been kicked out of the church.

584
00:31:12.365 --> 00:31:13.585
We talked about that last time.

585
00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:18.185
I think, uh, one other thing about David's meditation,

586
00:31:18.245 --> 00:31:19.985
you might have noticed that he

587
00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:21.545
actually included a reference.

588
00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:25.025
He didn't name it, but he actually referred back to someone

589
00:31:25.565 --> 00:31:29.025
who was being condemned by the religious leaders,

590
00:31:29.725 --> 00:31:31.305
the women caught in adultery.

591
00:31:32.065 --> 00:31:36.065
I think that's John a And that's

592
00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:39.425
where he literally said to her, uh,

593
00:31:40.355 --> 00:31:44.305
after he had gotten rid of them by saying, okay, if you,

594
00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:45.545
if you haven't ever sinned,

595
00:31:45.545 --> 00:31:46.945
then you can start throwing your stone.

596
00:31:46.965 --> 00:31:49.065
And they all left. Then he turns to her

597
00:31:49.065 --> 00:31:51.385
and says, where are your accusers?

598
00:31:51.565 --> 00:31:53.825
One translation actually says Condemners.

599
00:31:56.285 --> 00:31:57.425
And she says, they've gone.

600
00:31:57.445 --> 00:32:01.985
He says, neither do I condemn you. Go and say no more.

601
00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:06.785
So take a moment thinking about those verses

602
00:32:07.805 --> 00:32:12.065
as there is what your god's

603
00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:17.385
attitude towards you is based on his own words.

604
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:23.105
But just share any thoughts

605
00:32:23.105 --> 00:32:26.905
that you have about your own sense of struggle.

606
00:32:27.085 --> 00:32:30.545
Or if you don't struggle with that, rejoice in that. Okay?

607
00:32:31.335 --> 00:32:34.385
Alright. And I know there's a couple

608
00:32:34.405 --> 00:32:37.865
of you here without your spouses, if you guys want to just

609
00:32:38.605 --> 00:32:40.925
pop over and share with each other a little bit,

610
00:32:41.075 --> 00:32:42.445
that would be courageous.

611
00:32:42.705 --> 00:32:46.525
But, uh, Anyway, I leave that to you. Okay.

612
00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:49.165
Go ahead and share. We'll take about five minutes for this.

613
00:40:36.115 --> 00:40:37.245
It's doing my civic duty.

614
00:41:22.495 --> 00:41:22.785
What

615
00:41:22.785 --> 00:41:23.785
Do you want? I can't figure out

616
00:41:23.785 --> 00:41:25.185
how to shut off the music.

617
00:41:26.225 --> 00:41:29.625
I thought if I just checked out of that, it would do that.

618
00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:51.245
So notice when I couldn't figure out how

619
00:41:51.585 --> 00:41:55.165
to turn off the music, I didn't tell myself I'm stupid.

620
00:41:57.555 --> 00:42:01.805
Instead I said, God has already pursued you

621
00:42:02.195 --> 00:42:05.525
with resources, some of whom are right here.

622
00:42:06.745 --> 00:42:08.965
He will quite you and music with his.

623
00:42:10.835 --> 00:42:12.845
That is so good. Alright.

624
00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:17.485
So hope that went well for you.

625
00:42:17.515 --> 00:42:20.965
Just having another, uh, time of

626
00:42:21.755 --> 00:42:25.045
meeting each other at the point of our deeper thoughts

627
00:42:25.145 --> 00:42:27.325
and feelings and considerations

628
00:42:28.115 --> 00:42:32.725
that we might have corrective emotional experiences for

629
00:42:32.755 --> 00:42:35.805
what the world that we live in has produced.

630
00:42:36.635 --> 00:42:40.885
Okay. And we can't count on that from our culture

631
00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:45.725
or, uh, even always our, even our neighbors.

632
00:42:45.865 --> 00:42:49.165
But we want to be able to count on that from each other

633
00:42:49.465 --> 00:42:53.005
and to know how to restore times when we have missed,

634
00:42:53.105 --> 00:42:54.125
missed that mark.

635
00:42:55.545 --> 00:42:59.005
So I put up here on the board, um,

636
00:43:00.275 --> 00:43:04.365
just a context for what are we doing in this course.

637
00:43:05.145 --> 00:43:07.285
Really a lot of this has to do

638
00:43:07.285 --> 00:43:09.485
with taking us from a rational

639
00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:14.045
and behavioral, uh, way of approaching us each other

640
00:43:14.075 --> 00:43:18.165
with expectations to one that's truly more relational,

641
00:43:19.215 --> 00:43:21.645
where I'm really hearing you and seeing you

642
00:43:23.625 --> 00:43:24.965
and not judging you.

643
00:43:26.905 --> 00:43:31.645
Um, but where the focus really goes to needs

644
00:43:31.835 --> 00:43:35.965
that you have, that I more than anybody else on planet Earth

645
00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:40.285
am called to serve those legitimate God ordained needs.

646
00:43:41.355 --> 00:43:43.685
Okay? And that's a very different approach.

647
00:43:43.755 --> 00:43:45.605
It's almost like saying, okay, Jesus,

648
00:43:45.705 --> 00:43:47.005
how are we gonna love Joyce today?

649
00:43:47.265 --> 00:43:48.645
And I think I blew it yesterday.

650
00:43:49.265 --> 00:43:52.165
So what do I need to do about that? Does that make sense?

651
00:43:52.305 --> 00:43:56.555
Mm-Hmm. And he's not beating

652
00:43:56.615 --> 00:43:57.835
me up over the mistakes.

653
00:43:57.865 --> 00:44:01.035
He's saying, let's do that again. Let's do that over.

654
00:44:01.845 --> 00:44:05.015
Does that make sense? It really makes a pretty good

655
00:44:05.015 --> 00:44:06.775
parenting model, by the way. Mm-Hmm.

656
00:44:07.675 --> 00:44:10.695
Um, So, um,

657
00:44:13.125 --> 00:44:14.575
want to transition to,

658
00:44:15.155 --> 00:44:18.455
Um, One other aspect of this.

659
00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:20.975
I'm just checking myself to see if I'm,

660
00:44:22.075 --> 00:44:24.335
if I've covered everything that I want to cover on that.

661
00:44:24.855 --> 00:44:29.535
I think so. Ah, so what do you do

662
00:44:29.635 --> 00:44:30.775
to try to repair

663
00:44:34.945 --> 00:44:39.205
wounds that might have actually contributed

664
00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:43.205
to some feelings about

665
00:44:44.035 --> 00:44:46.485
oneself like Joyce was sharing

666
00:44:47.355 --> 00:44:51.645
that her criticism was kind of tapping into a vulnerability

667
00:44:51.675 --> 00:44:55.285
that I already had and kind of adding to that.

668
00:44:56.425 --> 00:44:59.925
So clearly what you just heard her reference when she

669
00:44:59.925 --> 00:45:02.725
basically said, I repented of that.

670
00:45:03.575 --> 00:45:05.235
She didn't use that word today, but she did.

671
00:45:06.815 --> 00:45:09.155
And the word repent means to turn around

672
00:45:10.055 --> 00:45:11.395
and go the opposite direction.

673
00:45:11.655 --> 00:45:16.235
So it, it implies not just a words that I say, it's a change

674
00:45:16.905 --> 00:45:18.915
working from the inside out in me.

675
00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:23.755
I am moved with godly sorrow for how

676
00:45:23.865 --> 00:45:25.635
that has been hurtful to you.

677
00:45:25.905 --> 00:45:27.915
That was part of the material

678
00:45:27.915 --> 00:45:29.635
that you read in the last week or so.

679
00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:35.835
And based on that movement in my heart called Godly sorrow,

680
00:45:37.015 --> 00:45:40.835
that's what's motivating the needed change in my behavior.

681
00:45:42.175 --> 00:45:45.915
If I get to godly sorrow, which is not

682
00:45:46.515 --> 00:45:48.755
condemnation, see the difference?

683
00:45:49.445 --> 00:45:52.755
Godly sorrow is tied to something I did or failed to do.

684
00:45:53.935 --> 00:45:58.515
And it's very much related to some behavior of mine.

685
00:45:58.535 --> 00:46:01.275
Either something I did or something I didn't do.

686
00:46:02.575 --> 00:46:05.715
And I should feel conviction over

687
00:46:06.975 --> 00:46:08.145
that if it was wrong.

688
00:46:09.405 --> 00:46:11.265
But conviction is not condemnation.

689
00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:16.265
Conviction says that isn't living according to my way.

690
00:46:17.515 --> 00:46:20.985
Let's repent of that and get this right moving forward.

691
00:46:21.365 --> 00:46:24.105
And by the way, you need to go care for your spouse

692
00:46:24.105 --> 00:46:25.985
because they've already been hurt by that.

693
00:46:26.685 --> 00:46:29.985
So that's part of the what to do with condemnation.

694
00:46:30.535 --> 00:46:34.025
It's not just about condemnation's not tied

695
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:35.265
so much to what you do.

696
00:46:35.285 --> 00:46:36.865
It is tied to who you think you are.

697
00:46:38.725 --> 00:46:40.705
See, it's not about behavior, it's about identity

698
00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:42.705
or sense of identity.

699
00:46:44.005 --> 00:46:47.545
That's why I can be a born again

700
00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:51.665
Christ follower, imperfect as I am,

701
00:46:51.765 --> 00:46:55.105
but still Christ has come to abide in me.

702
00:46:56.405 --> 00:46:58.465
His sacrifice on the cross applies to me.

703
00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:05.185
And yet I can still think

704
00:47:07.765 --> 00:47:09.065
things about myself

705
00:47:09.065 --> 00:47:10.905
that are very different from what he says.

706
00:47:11.085 --> 00:47:15.785
So one of the ways that we can work with that is to

707
00:47:16.335 --> 00:47:21.025
embrace the truth of his way of loving me,

708
00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:22.745
this unconditional love.

709
00:47:23.885 --> 00:47:27.545
The other though is to experience more of what's good

710
00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:31.445
to experience about who you are.

711
00:47:32.505 --> 00:47:34.085
See, I said it's tied to identity.

712
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:37.565
If it's condemnation, a sense of I'm not enough.

713
00:47:38.675 --> 00:47:42.805
Well, who knows you best of all on planet earth,

714
00:47:44.135 --> 00:47:46.365
Apart from God, who's that gonna be?

715
00:47:47.225 --> 00:47:49.445
Me? Spouse. Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:47:49.655 --> 00:47:52.125
Joyce is gonna know me, warts and all.

717
00:47:53.085 --> 00:47:55.985
Um, your spouse probably knows you better than anybody.

718
00:47:56.815 --> 00:48:00.545
Okay? And what if

719
00:48:01.175 --> 00:48:05.705
they are regularly speaking

720
00:48:06.355 --> 00:48:11.345
truth to you about what God sees in you?

721
00:48:11.365 --> 00:48:14.025
That's good affirmation.

722
00:48:15.925 --> 00:48:18.265
Not just about something you did once.

723
00:48:19.565 --> 00:48:22.665
Congratulations, you graduated from this place

724
00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:24.025
or this place or whatever.

725
00:48:25.205 --> 00:48:28.465
That's all good. But where they look in your heart

726
00:48:28.485 --> 00:48:31.985
and say, I see great stability in you.

727
00:48:32.845 --> 00:48:36.665
Or I think you've got

728
00:48:37.345 --> 00:48:42.025
determination that a lot of people don't have, whatever

729
00:48:42.025 --> 00:48:44.265
that trait is, sensitivity,

730
00:48:47.085 --> 00:48:49.425
Um, Loyalty,

731
00:48:51.225 --> 00:48:52.265
whatever that is.

732
00:48:53.645 --> 00:48:55.465
So I want to give you just another minute

733
00:48:55.485 --> 00:48:58.375
or two to give thought to

734
00:49:00.085 --> 00:49:02.455
what is it Maybe a couple of things

735
00:49:02.455 --> 00:49:04.735
that I could say this is true of you.

736
00:49:04.735 --> 00:49:07.415
And I may have said it before, but I'm saying it again.

737
00:49:08.615 --> 00:49:09.735
I see this in you.

738
00:49:10.845 --> 00:49:14.935
Okay? And I hope that you do that

739
00:49:14.935 --> 00:49:16.255
for your kids also.

740
00:49:16.435 --> 00:49:20.775
Mm-Hmm. 'cause they'll probably give you opportunity to have

741
00:49:20.775 --> 00:49:22.255
to deal with some correction.

742
00:49:23.045 --> 00:49:25.215
This would be an affirmation. Okay?

743
00:49:28.535 --> 00:49:30.315
So just ask the Lord to bring

744
00:49:30.315 --> 00:49:31.795
to your mind a couple of things.

745
00:49:34.135 --> 00:49:38.415
Uh, I would often illustrate,

746
00:49:40.995 --> 00:49:43.815
uh, something like this exercise, uh,

747
00:49:44.035 --> 00:49:46.335
by pointing out things about Joyce

748
00:49:46.335 --> 00:49:50.815
that were about her diligence and her determination and,

749
00:49:51.515 --> 00:49:55.015
Um, Her responsibility.

750
00:49:55.155 --> 00:49:56.775
And those were always true.

751
00:50:00.355 --> 00:50:03.815
But what's fun is kind of watching for what do I see now

752
00:50:04.685 --> 00:50:06.775
that might be even different than that?

753
00:50:08.425 --> 00:50:12.995
This girl can't learn about

754
00:50:13.475 --> 00:50:16.875
somebody who's in need without sending them a card.

755
00:50:19.215 --> 00:50:21.795
Can I tell on you who you're sending one to?

756
00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:25.155
I guess, who am I sending one to? I dunno.

757
00:50:26.575 --> 00:50:28.325
Kenzie. Oh

758
00:50:28.355 --> 00:50:29.355
Yeah. Okay.

759
00:50:29.355 --> 00:50:31.525
Um,

760
00:50:33.645 --> 00:50:35.165
I mentioned we watched sports.

761
00:50:35.275 --> 00:50:38.245
Well, we watched OU softball, uh,

762
00:50:38.675 --> 00:50:39.845
some games they were playing.

763
00:50:39.945 --> 00:50:41.365
And there's this one player

764
00:50:41.385 --> 00:50:44.205
that's been there quite a time, uh, happens.

765
00:50:44.505 --> 00:50:45.805
We know she's a believer.

766
00:50:47.665 --> 00:50:52.405
And, uh, so George just said

767
00:50:52.405 --> 00:50:55.805
after watch game, I'm gonna send Kenzie a card.

768
00:50:56.945 --> 00:50:59.685
And next thing I know she's asking for a stamp.

769
00:51:00.245 --> 00:51:02.925
I mean, she just gets it done.

770
00:51:03.865 --> 00:51:05.645
I'd think about it for about three weeks.

771
00:51:07.745 --> 00:51:11.165
And I'm just saying that's not only diligence, that's

772
00:51:12.475 --> 00:51:15.925
empathy and kindness and friendliness.

773
00:51:17.185 --> 00:51:21.245
And she's not expecting that girl who's kind of a celebrity.

774
00:51:21.335 --> 00:51:24.285
She's not expecting her to do anything for Joyce.

775
00:51:24.705 --> 00:51:27.205
So I'm just saying that's a character trait.

776
00:51:29.105 --> 00:51:32.645
She sees something that would be a way to touch somebody.

777
00:51:32.865 --> 00:51:36.085
And she acts on not

778
00:51:36.145 --> 00:51:38.645
so much this guy, little different guy.

779
00:51:38.745 --> 00:51:41.645
Mm-Hmm. Okay. So that was an affirmation hurt.

780
00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:43.365
So just take a couple minutes here.

781
00:51:43.405 --> 00:51:46.525
I think I've bought you enough time, uh, to think something.

782
00:51:46.995 --> 00:51:48.365
Okay. And for,

783
00:51:48.365 --> 00:51:52.645
and for you guys to, uh, your spouses aren't here today.

784
00:51:52.775 --> 00:51:54.405
Maybe just make a note or two

785
00:51:54.465 --> 00:51:55.805
or something you could share later.

786
00:51:56.075 --> 00:51:57.845
Okay. Alright, go ahead.

787
00:55:25.745 --> 00:55:28.205
Can I borrow your help again?

788
00:55:28.435 --> 00:55:31.045
Stop the music. I didn't see

789
00:55:31.065 --> 00:55:32.765
how you pump that up. There's

790
00:55:32.765 --> 00:55:33.805
A little play button up here

791
00:55:34.185 --> 00:55:36.445
and this tiny little spot. It's hard to see.

792
00:55:37.185 --> 00:55:38.485
Oh, okay. When you click that

793
00:55:39.175 --> 00:55:41.005
Pause here. Okay.

794
00:55:41.895 --> 00:55:45.525
Thank you. I think we can just close it.

795
00:55:46.035 --> 00:55:50.085
Yeah. Okay.

796
00:55:59.065 --> 00:56:00.965
That's okay. It's just a clip.

797
00:56:07.585 --> 00:56:10.525
So the last time we taught this class, thank you.

798
00:56:11.625 --> 00:56:14.605
The last time we taught this class, um,

799
00:56:15.025 --> 00:56:18.245
we were running short of time that particular week.

800
00:56:18.945 --> 00:56:22.725
And so I kind of glossed over the part on sexual intimacy

801
00:56:23.385 --> 00:56:25.045
and I got scolded afterwards,

802
00:56:26.155 --> 00:56:28.245
Condemned, Not quiet

803
00:56:29.635 --> 00:56:31.165
Scolded Held accountable

804
00:56:33.075 --> 00:56:34.365
Holy Spirit type stuff.

805
00:56:34.985 --> 00:56:39.645
And, and it, and it was basically, uh, a guy in the class

806
00:56:40.065 --> 00:56:44.345
who, um, had heard

807
00:56:45.325 --> 00:56:49.625
enough people either totally dismiss talking about sexual

808
00:56:50.105 --> 00:56:51.505
intimacy in the church,

809
00:56:52.485 --> 00:56:54.385
or, um,

810
00:56:55.855 --> 00:56:59.505
they came from an old traditional way of looking at things

811
00:56:59.935 --> 00:57:04.225
that didn't really bless sexual intimacy as part

812
00:57:04.225 --> 00:57:08.145
of God's desire, that we would experience

813
00:57:08.815 --> 00:57:12.465
closeness in a way that was truly mutually

814
00:57:13.115 --> 00:57:14.665
validating and satisfying.

815
00:57:15.725 --> 00:57:18.345
And so that's clearly his will for us.

816
00:57:19.485 --> 00:57:23.945
Um, and so I decided I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

817
00:57:24.145 --> 00:57:25.945
I don't want anybody holding me accountable like that,

818
00:57:25.965 --> 00:57:30.385
but seriously, um, I'm, I'm going to,

819
00:57:30.805 --> 00:57:32.785
uh, just cover a few things about it.

820
00:57:32.885 --> 00:57:36.225
One of the things that helped me the most in terms of this

821
00:57:36.965 --> 00:57:40.185
is I was clearly raised in, uh,

822
00:57:40.745 --> 00:57:44.145
a much easier environment than what kids have today.

823
00:57:44.585 --> 00:57:48.465
I mean, I just can't imagine being a parent of a child today

824
00:57:49.045 --> 00:57:52.945
and trying to help them navigate all the things that are

825
00:57:53.455 --> 00:57:57.225
pressed upon them through media, through, uh,

826
00:57:58.195 --> 00:57:59.505
peers, et cetera.

827
00:58:00.365 --> 00:58:01.985
But we had our own share of

828
00:58:02.925 --> 00:58:05.585
not good things going on back when we were growing up.

829
00:58:06.605 --> 00:58:10.665
But, um, I just remember there being a lot

830
00:58:10.665 --> 00:58:12.665
of focus on, uh,

831
00:58:15.725 --> 00:58:18.665
sex being something that we take

832
00:58:20.285 --> 00:58:25.025
or we have, which makes it like a possession.

833
00:58:26.455 --> 00:58:28.545
Does that make sense? In a general sense?

834
00:58:28.615 --> 00:58:32.225
It's like if we view it as something we have

835
00:58:33.045 --> 00:58:37.305
or do, uh, rather than something

836
00:58:37.335 --> 00:58:39.105
that is part of how we grow

837
00:58:39.165 --> 00:58:44.105
and share, then we're, we're, we're probably

838
00:58:44.745 --> 00:58:47.385
actually building in a little bit of performance pressure

839
00:58:48.205 --> 00:58:49.345
on one or both of us.

840
00:58:50.845 --> 00:58:52.145
And that'll get in the way.

841
00:58:52.645 --> 00:58:55.225
So we don't want it to be something we take

842
00:58:55.405 --> 00:58:58.105
or something we have, uh,

843
00:58:58.155 --> 00:59:01.785
definitely not something we keep score on, okay?

844
00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:04.625
'cause that puts a performance issue into it.

845
00:59:05.205 --> 00:59:07.865
But it's rather, it's something that we are becoming,

846
00:59:08.195 --> 00:59:12.745
we're becoming more free to express our intimacy

847
00:59:12.745 --> 00:59:13.985
and our love for one another,

848
00:59:14.975 --> 00:59:17.465
including in physical closeness.

849
00:59:18.335 --> 00:59:22.445
Okay? So just kind of a bit of a mindset there.

850
00:59:23.105 --> 00:59:27.005
God intended our sexual intimacy to honor him,

851
00:59:27.785 --> 00:59:32.205
but also to be mutually fulfilling to both spouses.

852
00:59:33.625 --> 00:59:35.885
Now that among other things we've already talked about

853
00:59:35.885 --> 00:59:37.405
differences in personality

854
00:59:37.665 --> 00:59:42.645
and how if I'm gonna meet Joyce's relational

855
00:59:42.695 --> 00:59:44.725
needs, not talking sexual needs right now,

856
00:59:44.745 --> 00:59:48.565
but relational needs, if I'm gonna meet those needs, I need

857
00:59:48.565 --> 00:59:52.125
to meet them according to what really is relevant

858
00:59:52.125 --> 00:59:54.845
to her rather than the way I would want that need met.

859
00:59:55.035 --> 00:59:59.415
Okay? But when it comes to sex, we never want to

860
01:00:00.395 --> 01:00:03.615
expect someone to participate in something

861
01:00:03.615 --> 01:00:05.775
that isn't comfortable for them.

862
01:00:06.955 --> 01:00:11.135
So that's kind of a ground rule, is there might be something

863
01:00:11.135 --> 01:00:13.575
that you would experience as pleasurable,

864
01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:17.255
but it would actually create stress

865
01:00:17.515 --> 01:00:20.055
or, uh, anxiety for your spouse.

866
01:00:20.275 --> 01:00:23.695
And we'd say, don't do it, then take that off the table.

867
01:00:24.565 --> 01:00:26.415
Okay? It ain't worth it

868
01:00:26.555 --> 01:00:30.255
to make somebody feel uncomfortable in order to

869
01:00:31.345 --> 01:00:33.015
experience pleasure in a certain way.

870
01:00:34.395 --> 01:00:38.575
So that's kind of boldly me speaking something that, um,

871
01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:41.655
was very important for us to understand too.

872
01:00:43.075 --> 01:00:45.575
But on the other hand, um,

873
01:00:47.275 --> 01:00:51.495
within the scope of what are both of you

874
01:00:52.925 --> 01:00:57.735
okay with, um, learn from each other?

875
01:00:57.805 --> 01:01:01.215
Well, what, what would make an ideal,

876
01:01:02.595 --> 01:01:06.815
uh, sexual encounter with me?

877
01:01:07.085 --> 01:01:09.295
What would make that better for you?

878
01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:12.975
What would make that enjoyable and pleasurable for you

879
01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:16.675
and honoring to you as well as to God?

880
01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:20.875
Okay? So in a minute I'm gonna pass out some worksheets,

881
01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:21.915
but this is homework.

882
01:01:24.635 --> 01:01:26.035
I think I timed this about right,

883
01:01:27.815 --> 01:01:31.275
so I'm not skirting the issue, but, um, I

884
01:01:31.275 --> 01:01:33.035
Was getting ready to volunteer the Brooks if

885
01:01:33.035 --> 01:01:34.075
you needed somebody to

886
01:01:38.175 --> 01:01:40.035
No, that could get a lot of us in trouble.

887
01:01:40.825 --> 01:01:45.715
Okay? So they, they actually developed a, a way, uh,

888
01:01:45.715 --> 01:01:48.675
kind of a questionnaire for you to individually reflect on

889
01:01:48.895 --> 01:01:53.595
and then actually express your own preferences about

890
01:01:53.745 --> 01:01:58.595
what would make this, um, experience pleasurable.

891
01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.875
I remember David Ferguson,

892
01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:02.875
who's got a real good sense of humor.

893
01:02:03.695 --> 01:02:06.715
Uh, do you remember this, uh, saying that

894
01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:11.195
when his wife came back with her list,

895
01:02:12.415 --> 01:02:15.275
it started with two weeks beforehand,

896
01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:23.725
flirt with me two weeks before,

897
01:02:25.745 --> 01:02:28.125
and then I, I may mess this up, calendaring

898
01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:29.125
These items, right?

899
01:02:29.195 --> 01:02:31.325
Yeah. And then she had, you know,

900
01:02:31.385 --> 01:02:36.245
and then, uh, let's have some time on the patio talking.

901
01:02:37.705 --> 01:02:40.365
And basically she was coming up with a lot

902
01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:42.525
of relational things

903
01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:49.405
long before we get close to the bedroom, okay?

904
01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:50.805
Like maybe days before,

905
01:02:51.825 --> 01:02:56.235
Because That's actually helping her feel loved

906
01:02:56.375 --> 01:02:58.915
and cared for and respected and so forth.

907
01:03:00.815 --> 01:03:03.675
And David said, I looked at my sheet for my preferences

908
01:03:06.815 --> 01:03:09.355
and he said, number one, get naked.

909
01:03:13.855 --> 01:03:18.755
And, uh, so

910
01:03:18.935 --> 01:03:21.475
by in large part,

911
01:03:22.895 --> 01:03:24.275
God wired us differently

912
01:03:26.575 --> 01:03:29.435
and this is one of the places where that really matters.

913
01:03:30.175 --> 01:03:33.715
So, um, just taking

914
01:03:33.865 --> 01:03:38.355
that into consideration, you each fill this out,

915
01:03:38.885 --> 01:03:41.835
share it with one another, not right

916
01:03:41.835 --> 01:03:43.835
before you're going to bed, okay?

917
01:03:44.735 --> 01:03:45.755
In other words, this is

918
01:03:45.775 --> 01:03:49.435
to really more deeply understand each other, okay?

919
01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.715
Um, problem for many couples is

920
01:03:55.715 --> 01:03:57.595
that the only time they talk about sex

921
01:03:57.695 --> 01:03:58.875
is when they're frustrated.

922
01:04:00.225 --> 01:04:02.355
That make sense? I mean, we've been there

923
01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:06.635
and so we're actually encouraging you, number one, see it

924
01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:07.835
as this is a blessing.

925
01:04:08.025 --> 01:04:11.355
Obviously, if you look at the scripture, obviously intended

926
01:04:11.975 --> 01:04:14.515
by God as a gift, um,

927
01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:18.595
but oftentimes we aren't meeting the relational needs

928
01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:23.115
along the way, and therefore it becomes something we do.

929
01:04:23.975 --> 01:04:28.675
And often something we do when we don't necessarily want

930
01:04:28.715 --> 01:04:30.155
to, okay?

931
01:04:30.155 --> 01:04:33.315
And that's not what we want to aim for. Okay?

932
01:04:34.615 --> 01:04:37.115
So lots of freedom, lots of care.

933
01:04:39.255 --> 01:04:43.155
Um, So the lack

934
01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:46.395
of open communication about our sexual relationship,

935
01:04:46.455 --> 01:04:50.315
and it is maybe the most vulnerable

936
01:04:50.335 --> 01:04:53.155
or one of the most vulnerable things to talk about,

937
01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:55.635
because I would say for men

938
01:04:55.775 --> 01:05:00.315
and women, uh, it is one of the most vulnerable places

939
01:05:00.405 --> 01:05:04.395
where all it would take is a disgusting sigh

940
01:05:05.895 --> 01:05:08.635
to destroy your feelings.

941
01:05:09.055 --> 01:05:13.675
You know, something like that. A negative, uh, comment.

942
01:05:13.975 --> 01:05:17.725
So we want it to bless both people and

943
01:05:17.725 --> 01:05:20.725
therefore my job is to bless her.

944
01:05:21.185 --> 01:05:25.285
Her job is to bless me so we're not taking from one another.

945
01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.685
That make sense? Thoughts?

946
01:05:27.765 --> 01:05:31.325
I look back to when I was a little girl. I know.

947
01:05:31.455 --> 01:05:34.325
Don't ever remember a discussion about it with my mother.

948
01:05:34.975 --> 01:05:37.965
Never. Or about the time

949
01:05:37.965 --> 01:05:40.445
that I would've been starting a period.

950
01:05:41.425 --> 01:05:43.085
We didn't talk about that either. Mm-Hmm.

951
01:05:43.475 --> 01:05:48.125
Yeah. So that's what I bring to this relationship.

952
01:05:48.355 --> 01:05:51.245
Yeah. So that,

953
01:05:51.795 --> 01:05:54.085
that might've helped if we had had those kinds

954
01:05:54.085 --> 01:05:56.605
of caring conversations with our parents.

955
01:05:57.505 --> 01:06:01.965
Um, and even then when I, you know, I,

956
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.805
I might have needed more help than that,

957
01:06:03.945 --> 01:06:07.605
but the bottom line is we're trying to bless this

958
01:06:07.705 --> 01:06:09.645
as something that is truly a gift from God.

959
01:06:09.985 --> 01:06:13.445
And yet you can see all the focus we put on relational needs

960
01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:18.395
would be so helpful when it comes to our sexual intimacy.

961
01:06:19.135 --> 01:06:21.475
So just wanna lift that part up.

962
01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:28.165
Um, Any thoughts, questions?

963
01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:35.805
Okay. Um,

964
01:06:37.215 --> 01:06:38.685
there are two handouts, guys.

965
01:06:38.785 --> 01:06:40.165
Get one. Girls good Feel

966
01:06:42.975 --> 01:06:44.165
there should be enough here.

967
01:07:08.505 --> 01:07:11.405
So is this, what's on that barcode on page 1 35?

968
01:07:12.805 --> 01:07:16.165
I think some of us had this, I have not yet.

969
01:07:19.865 --> 01:07:22.565
It should be the same thing. Didn't have this

970
01:07:23.455 --> 01:07:28.325
mines. I'm

971
01:07:28.325 --> 01:07:29.325
Glad you mentioned that. I need

972
01:07:29.325 --> 01:07:30.565
to make state that.

973
01:07:34.155 --> 01:07:35.845
Wait, what is that 1 35?

974
01:07:37.155 --> 01:07:41.085
Okay, So if you look in your books on page

975
01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:46.125
1 35, Uh, I think there's a

976
01:07:46.765 --> 01:07:48.525
Reference there is at the bottom.

977
01:07:49.555 --> 01:07:53.005
Does it say, and finally, yes. Okay.

978
01:07:53.745 --> 01:07:58.085
So in ER's book, there's a barcode down below

979
01:07:58.395 --> 01:07:59.925
that in Ed's book there wasn't.

980
01:08:00.475 --> 01:08:05.045
Okay. And it is because of a different printing. Yeah. Okay.

981
01:08:05.475 --> 01:08:07.965
They, they omitted it accidentally.

982
01:08:08.905 --> 01:08:11.445
So if you don't have a QR code,

983
01:08:11.795 --> 01:08:13.725
what I just passed out to you, is it?

984
01:08:13.745 --> 01:08:14.805
Mm-Hmm. Okay.

985
01:08:14.805 --> 01:08:18.285
That'll get you by. But, uh, apparently in this batch

986
01:08:18.285 --> 01:08:20.365
of books, we've got two different printers.

987
01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:23.245
So they did fix that.

988
01:08:23.425 --> 01:08:25.485
But, uh, I'm glad you mentioned that

989
01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:27.365
'cause I was just assuming it's been fixed.

990
01:08:28.685 --> 01:08:32.285
Thoughts, questions. Is this working?

991
01:08:33.545 --> 01:08:35.445
Is this okay? Yeah. Alright.

992
01:08:35.585 --> 01:08:38.885
We got one more meeting and it's kind of a wrap up meeting,

993
01:08:39.025 --> 01:08:41.645
but, um, you've got a few more days in your book

994
01:08:42.545 --> 01:08:47.405
and, uh, I just encourage you, um, uh,

995
01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:50.445
keep the process, if you've ever gotten behind

996
01:08:50.445 --> 01:08:53.765
during these weeks, uh, just encourage you, uh,

997
01:08:54.265 --> 01:08:55.325
circle the wagons

998
01:08:55.325 --> 01:08:58.885
and pick up those other days, uh, later on.

999
01:08:59.345 --> 01:09:01.885
And, uh, we just want to kind of serve you

1000
01:09:01.905 --> 01:09:04.485
by getting you into this material as well as we can.

1001
01:09:05.585 --> 01:09:07.565
And, uh, do you have anything else you wanted to say?

1002
01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.565
You want to close this in prayer? Sure. Okay.

1003
01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:18.445
What a wonderful group of people we've had this time.

1004
01:09:18.585 --> 01:09:21.525
We thank you for bringing each and every couple to us

1005
01:09:22.545 --> 01:09:25.845
and pray that we'll be able to, Bruce

1006
01:09:25.905 --> 01:09:29.565
and I to continue to live out these principles

1007
01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:33.165
to honor you in every couple here.

1008
01:09:33.905 --> 01:09:37.045
And we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
