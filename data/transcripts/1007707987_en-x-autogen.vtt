1
00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:22.745
But as we turn now to God's word, let me invite you

2
00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:24.745
to take your copy of it and turn with me

3
00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:27.185
to one Samuel chapter two, back

4
00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:29.465
to one Samuel two in the Old Testament,

5
00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:32.665
continuing this sermon series through this book.

6
00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:36.465
Just as a way of reminder that

7
00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:40.745
Israel has been settled in the land for a little while,

8
00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:44.065
but they were a pretty disorganized bunch of tribes,

9
00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:47.465
only loosely connected by their religious heritage

10
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:48.785
and the religious practices.

11
00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:53.045
Yet as they let sin

12
00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:58.045
and false idols creep into their lives, the society began

13
00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.475
to deteriorate, even to the point

14
00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:04.115
where the highest priests in the land

15
00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:06.955
were sitting blatantly publicly.

16
00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:11.715
Everybody knew it so it could feel like God was absent.

17
00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.435
But actually he wasn't because he was working

18
00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:16.875
through a barren, yet faithful woman named Hannah

19
00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:22.595
to bring about life, to breathe life back into his people

20
00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:27.935
through the gift of a son to her named Samuel, that one

21
00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:30.935
that she prayed for, and the one that she turned around

22
00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:31.935
and gave back to God.

23
00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.795
But what we're gonna come to today is how God responded

24
00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:39.875
to the high priest family's sin.

25
00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:44.395
H how did they, did they get away with it or,

26
00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:46.395
or what was the process of how they were gonna hand?

27
00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:50.405
What did God do to break through the silence,

28
00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:55.205
to correct the wrongs, to reset worship in Israel?

29
00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:56.685
What did God do?

30
00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.405
And then the the follow up question is, how is any

31
00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:00.845
of this relevant for us today?

32
00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:04.685
It is just a good history lesson is what? What is this like?

33
00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:07.285
Why does it matter to us? What happens

34
00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:09.325
here in these two chapters?

35
00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:14.425
Well, we're gonna see some similarities in our lives today,

36
00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:17.515
but I also want you to know

37
00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.475
that we're gonna see our savior in this.

38
00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:24.385
So hang with me on this, but first, what did we do?

39
00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:28.985
Well, what did God do with the pervasive sin in Eli

40
00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:30.945
and his sons, those priests that were sending blatantly?

41
00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.505
What did God do with them? Well,

42
00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:35.905
God installed a new line of priests.

43
00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:38.545
Like that's what he did. He, he said, you're done.

44
00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:42.945
I'm gonna install a new line of priests.

45
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:45.465
In fact, you'll see it here as we get into the text.

46
00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.305
First Samuel two, starting in verse 27,

47
00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:55.125
There came a man of God to Eli.

48
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.605
I remember Eli was the high priest

49
00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.325
and said to him, thus says the Lord.

50
00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:01.645
So this is now God speaking.

51
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:05.225
Did I indeed reveal myself to the house

52
00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:06.945
of your father when they were in Egypt,

53
00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:08.305
subject to the house of Pharaoh?

54
00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:11.055
Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel

55
00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:13.615
to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense,

56
00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:14.775
to wear an epha before me?

57
00:03:15.975 --> 00:03:18.255
I gave to the house of your father all my offerings

58
00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:19.935
by fire from the people of Israel.

59
00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:23.975
Why then do you scorn my sacrifices

60
00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.975
and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling?

61
00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.415
And honor your sons above me

62
00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:31.015
by fattening yourselves on the choices parts

63
00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:32.335
of every offering of my people, Israel.

64
00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:34.975
Now the man of God speaks,

65
00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:36.095
therefore the Lord, the God

66
00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:38.695
of Israel declares God is speaking again.

67
00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:40.655
I promised that your house

68
00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:42.215
and the house of your father should go

69
00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:43.295
in and out before me forever.

70
00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:46.615
But now the Lord declares far be it from me.

71
00:03:47.775 --> 00:03:49.195
For those who honor me, I'll honor.

72
00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:51.835
Those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

73
00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:55.035
Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your

74
00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:56.915
strength and the strength of your father's house.

75
00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:59.635
So there will not be an old man in your house.

76
00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:02.975
Then in distress, you will look

77
00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:04.695
with envious eye on all the prosperity

78
00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:06.015
that shall be bestowed on Israel.

79
00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.095
There shall not be an old man in your house forever.

80
00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:11.895
The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altars

81
00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:15.455
shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart.

82
00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:17.775
And all the descendants of your house

83
00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:19.055
shall die by the sword of men.

84
00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:22.085
This that shall come upon your two sons Hof,

85
00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:23.765
and Phineas shall be the sign to you.

86
00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:25.765
Both of them shall die on the same day.

87
00:04:27.055 --> 00:04:29.315
And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest

88
00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:31.915
who shall do according to what is in my heart, my mind.

89
00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:33.355
I'll build him a sure house.

90
00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:35.675
He should go in and out before my anointed forever.

91
00:04:36.855 --> 00:04:38.675
And everyone who is left in your house shall come

92
00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:40.995
to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread.

93
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.835
She'll say, please put me in one of the priests places

94
00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:46.115
that I may eat a mor soul of bread.

95
00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.005
So what's even happening here?

96
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:54.465
Well, back in Exodus, what this guy's referring to is

97
00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:57.545
that Aaron and his family had received God's blessings

98
00:04:57.545 --> 00:04:59.905
of becoming the priests of the nation.

99
00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:02.145
That means they got to go to the altar.

100
00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:03.905
They meant they got to share in the meals

101
00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:06.105
that would come from the sacrifices.

102
00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:08.905
They got to wear the special clothes, they got to do all of

103
00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:11.905
that because they were given the blessing of being priests.

104
00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:14.745
Yet this man of God looks at Eli, the priest

105
00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:16.145
and his sons who are in line

106
00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:17.865
to be the priest for getting he.

107
00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.745
He calls him out for getting fat off of all that stuff.

108
00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:23.455
In fact, the word

109
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:26.055
for fattening yourselves is the same word used,

110
00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:29.175
translated elsewhere for glory heaviness.

111
00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:33.095
So basically, this man looks at Eli

112
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:37.625
and he says, you guys are glorifying yourselves instead

113
00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:39.305
of glorifying me as God.

114
00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:43.325
That's what God was saying, you glorify yourself instead

115
00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:44.525
of glorifying me.

116
00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:45.605
And that's the point.

117
00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:50.135
That's why Eli's family was removed

118
00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:52.455
as the line of priests.

119
00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:58.895
Yes, they were sinning, but they were just

120
00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:00.335
saying, God, it's not about you.

121
00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:04.775
It's about us. And that is nothing that a priest

122
00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:07.415
or any leader should ever say.

123
00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:11.155
They viewed God's sacrifices as worthless.

124
00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:12.475
They didn't honor God.

125
00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:15.515
And so they would not flourish as a priest was supposed to.

126
00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:19.955
Instead, they would starve and eventually be desperate.

127
00:06:21.445 --> 00:06:23.635
There wouldn't be very many of 'em left alive, if any.

128
00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:25.515
Well, the only ones that would be left alive

129
00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:26.555
would only be alive.

130
00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:28.635
So they could see what God does with people

131
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:29.715
who grieve his heart

132
00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:35.115
and their grief, as we said last

133
00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:36.555
week in kind of a funny way.

134
00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:38.155
Their grief would be very great.

135
00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:45.425
Now, the question that naturally comes up here, I mean,

136
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:47.505
we kind of get this, that of course they shouldn't be

137
00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:49.825
leaders, but the question that comes up here based on the

138
00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:51.665
reading of the text is that it seems like God

139
00:06:51.665 --> 00:06:52.705
changed his mind.

140
00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:57.295
It seems like God changed.

141
00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:00.655
No, actually, he already knew that Eli

142
00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:03.975
and his sons were going to be wicked worthless men.

143
00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:07.615
And it was God's plan all along to install

144
00:07:08.175 --> 00:07:09.655
a new line of priests.

145
00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:13.155
He already had all that working.

146
00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:15.955
But to us, here's the, here's the point to us.

147
00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:19.595
He lets this picture get painted in our lives

148
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:24.675
that when things like sin come up, they cost us dearly.

149
00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:29.945
That when we turn away from him

150
00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:34.185
and we turn away from his ways, life hurts really bad.

151
00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:37.355
So he's already working it out.

152
00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.995
But for us, it seems like something changes based on what?

153
00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:45.955
Based on sin, based on just turning your back on God.

154
00:07:47.695 --> 00:07:49.185
Because how else would we learn?

155
00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:53.685
How else do you learn that the stove is hot

156
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.285
and it'll burn you when you touch it?

157
00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.615
Now, hopefully you'll learn from somebody else's mistake,

158
00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:01.815
but hopefully you, it,

159
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.415
it doesn't always work out that way, right?

160
00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:06.265
It's an instructive consequence

161
00:08:07.835 --> 00:08:09.485
that you touch it and it burns you.

162
00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:11.205
This is the same kind of idea here.

163
00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:13.765
It's instructive in such that it teaches us

164
00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:16.085
what we should not do just as much

165
00:08:16.105 --> 00:08:17.565
as we need to learn what to do.

166
00:08:18.345 --> 00:08:21.325
And so Eli's family,

167
00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:26.755
the consequence removal from the priestly line.

168
00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:30.555
But again, God knows God's work in this whole thing.

169
00:08:30.575 --> 00:08:33.355
Did God just leave it empty? No. What's he doing?

170
00:08:33.365 --> 00:08:38.075
Watch this. Look at verse 35 again in this

171
00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.515
to Eli, he says, I will raise up for myself a

172
00:08:41.035 --> 00:08:43.835
faithful priest who shall do according to

173
00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:46.155
what is in my heart and in my mind,

174
00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:50.075
and I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in

175
00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:52.035
and out before my anointed forever.

176
00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:57.125
He says, there's, there's gonna be a line of priests

177
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:58.445
that it works, right?

178
00:08:58.445 --> 00:09:01.555
They're faithful, which is, by the way,

179
00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:04.235
an essential component to the kingship working

180
00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:05.515
as it was supposed to work.

181
00:09:06.585 --> 00:09:08.685
So a priest, a faithful line

182
00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:10.445
of priests was really important.

183
00:09:10.445 --> 00:09:11.485
In fact, we'll see that come up

184
00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:14.445
with David in a couple chapters, how Zadak probably was

185
00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:16.045
who he's referring to here.

186
00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:17.525
But that's part of it.

187
00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:20.405
There's also a lot of Messiah language in that verse.

188
00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:25.505
Did you catch it? There's a portrayal of perfection,

189
00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:31.175
a portrayal of faithfulness, knowing God's mind.

190
00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:35.545
There's a portrayal of, of a certain house,

191
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.625
like a a sure rock foundation.

192
00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.865
There's a, there's a picture painted of,

193
00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:41.905
of a forever priest, right?

194
00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:44.625
So, so there's something beyond just humanity here.

195
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.905
There's, there's something looking ahead.

196
00:09:46.975 --> 00:09:49.545
It's actually to what Hebrews four says.

197
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:53.445
Since then, we have a great high priest

198
00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:56.285
who has passed through the heavens.

199
00:09:56.455 --> 00:10:00.125
Jesus, the son of God, let us hold fast. Our confession.

200
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:01.685
We don't have a high priest who's unable

201
00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.085
to sympathize with our weaknesses.

202
00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:05.765
One who in every respect has been tempted as we are

203
00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:07.965
yet without sin.

204
00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:11.405
Like the only one who's seen God is God himself.

205
00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:15.005
And this one, the faithful one, Jesus, the son of God,

206
00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:17.725
he is perfect, lived a life that

207
00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:19.645
that one Samuel two talks about.

208
00:10:19.915 --> 00:10:22.925
He's going in and out before the Father forever, right?

209
00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:26.925
That's the picture that this verse is ultimately painting.

210
00:10:26.935 --> 00:10:31.325
Jesus is the ultimate, faithful high priest.

211
00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:36.805
But there's also a temporary fulfillment to this as well.

212
00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:40.535
Eli and his sons were being replaced.

213
00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:41.815
They couldn't just leave it empty.

214
00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:45.255
So somebody had to fill the gap.

215
00:10:45.275 --> 00:10:48.895
And it's initially the one who's been contrasted

216
00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:51.615
with Eli's sons the whole time already.

217
00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.135
Eli's sons are wicked worthless men.

218
00:10:54.165 --> 00:10:56.175
There's another son that has shown up,

219
00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:58.255
and his heart was right.

220
00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:01.565
His name was Samuel. I remember

221
00:11:01.565 --> 00:11:03.685
that from the very beginning, even before his birth.

222
00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:08.755
Hannah is praying these things. This is the gift he's given.

223
00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:12.035
Hannah's praying these things. Was she praying?

224
00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:14.155
She's praying all of this same kind of stuff

225
00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:18.245
that this new son whose heart was right

226
00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:21.885
before God, is the replacement figure.

227
00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:24.955
We'll get even a more stark contrast

228
00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:26.235
as we move into the next chapter.

229
00:11:26.865 --> 00:11:29.755
This young boy called By God. We'll see this process happen.

230
00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:30.955
The contrast show up.

231
00:11:30.955 --> 00:11:32.155
Just start with verse one,

232
00:11:32.345 --> 00:11:35.855
chapter three, this sets the scene.

233
00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:39.575
Now, the boy, Samuel, remember he's young, was ministering

234
00:11:39.575 --> 00:11:41.455
to the Lord in the presence of Eli.

235
00:11:42.155 --> 00:11:43.615
And the word of the Lord was rare.

236
00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:46.175
In those days, there was no frequent vision.

237
00:11:46.275 --> 00:11:47.495
Now, remember, Samuel's young,

238
00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:51.575
he's a boy serving faithfully in the tabernacle,

239
00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:54.685
but we immediately get a sense of this replacement idea.

240
00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:57.845
Eli is there. Eli was there with his sons.

241
00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:01.805
Eli's there now with this innocence, new son named Samuel.

242
00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:05.085
So we get a picture, again, the contrast,

243
00:12:05.105 --> 00:12:07.765
but we also get a picture of the desolation.

244
00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:10.595
Israel would've felt back then.

245
00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:14.575
You see that the word, the Lord was rare.

246
00:12:14.605 --> 00:12:17.815
They didn't have this. They didn't have, this is God's word.

247
00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:21.175
They didn't have it. They needed people to speak the word

248
00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:23.055
of the Lord under his inspiration.

249
00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:24.295
They didn't have it. They were,

250
00:12:24.425 --> 00:12:26.495
there were few people speaking on behalf of God,

251
00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:29.735
even the supposed priests, Eli's sons who were supposed

252
00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:31.295
to have the ability to hear from God.

253
00:12:31.525 --> 00:12:32.895
Clearly or not.

254
00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:38.065
Verse two adds to the tension.

255
00:12:38.205 --> 00:12:41.785
It says at the time, Eli, whose eyesight had begun

256
00:12:41.785 --> 00:12:45.105
to grow dim so that he could not see was lying down in

257
00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:46.505
his own place.

258
00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:49.785
This is a physical representation of what was happening

259
00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:50.825
inside of Eli.

260
00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:54.145
His eyesight was dimming. He was unable to see God anymore.

261
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:56.705
And what did he, we've already seen this from him, right?

262
00:12:56.705 --> 00:12:59.755
What did he think Hannah was doing? Hannah's praying.

263
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:01.635
Eli, the supposed priest,

264
00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:03.675
hearing from God, Hannah's praying.

265
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:05.155
And she, he thinks she's drunk.

266
00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:08.265
He can't even understand that we're about

267
00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:13.145
to see it even more, that Eli is fading away.

268
00:13:15.365 --> 00:13:19.895
Look at verse three. The lamp of God had not yet gone out,

269
00:13:19.895 --> 00:13:22.415
meaning God really wasn't done yet with them.

270
00:13:22.955 --> 00:13:25.175
And Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord

271
00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:26.255
where the Ark of God was.

272
00:13:26.645 --> 00:13:28.655
Then the Lord called Samuel,

273
00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:31.755
and Samuel said, here I am.

274
00:13:32.295 --> 00:13:35.675
And he ran to Eli. He said, here I am you. You called me.

275
00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:40.195
But Eli said, I did not call lie down again.

276
00:13:40.615 --> 00:13:42.115
And so Samuel went and laid down,

277
00:13:42.135 --> 00:13:46.555
and the Lord called again, Samuel Samuel Rosen went to Eli

278
00:13:46.555 --> 00:13:48.355
and said, here I am for you called me.

279
00:13:49.455 --> 00:13:52.795
But Eli said, I did not call my son. Lie down again.

280
00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:57.435
Now, verse seven. Now, Samuel did not yet know the Lord,

281
00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:02.315
and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.

282
00:14:04.675 --> 00:14:06.015
So you track that, right?

283
00:14:06.015 --> 00:14:07.935
Samuel thinks Eli's calling his name,

284
00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:09.895
and so a faithful servant.

285
00:14:09.925 --> 00:14:11.455
He's like, oh, Eli, what do you need? Man?

286
00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:12.695
It's the middle of the night. What do you need?

287
00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:16.845
But Samuel didn't recognize.

288
00:14:17.785 --> 00:14:19.045
Eli clearly didn't understand,

289
00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.925
but even Samuel did not recognize God's voice

290
00:14:22.315 --> 00:14:24.165
because he hadn't heard it yet.

291
00:14:25.015 --> 00:14:27.995
It was rare. He hadn't heard it. He didn't know God.

292
00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:31.895
It says, now, if you read carefully,

293
00:14:31.895 --> 00:14:33.495
that might ring a bell for us.

294
00:14:34.195 --> 00:14:38.015
Do you remember what one Samuel two verse 12 said

295
00:14:38.015 --> 00:14:39.175
about Eli's sons?

296
00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:42.695
He's worthless men. Of course, it says similarly,

297
00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:44.295
they did not know the Lord.

298
00:14:46.375 --> 00:14:49.555
And here, almost the same phrasing about Samuel,

299
00:14:49.815 --> 00:14:51.565
but there's a critical difference.

300
00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:55.125
Did you catch it? Go look at it again. Read it carefully.

301
00:14:55.515 --> 00:14:58.765
Chapter three, verse seven, with Samuel, it says,

302
00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:02.235
Samuel did not yet know the Lord.

303
00:15:02.295 --> 00:15:05.195
In fact, that word is original language. It's in there.

304
00:15:06.655 --> 00:15:08.525
We're not reading that into it. It's in there.

305
00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:10.885
Samuel did not yet know the Lord.

306
00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:12.845
Eli's sons didn't know the Lord.

307
00:15:13.305 --> 00:15:15.645
Samuel did not yet know the Lord.

308
00:15:15.675 --> 00:15:16.765
It's setting up an assumption

309
00:15:16.835 --> 00:15:19.845
that this son will be different than Eli's sons were.

310
00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:22.755
That he will eventually know the Lord.

311
00:15:22.815 --> 00:15:25.555
He will eventually become that faithful priest

312
00:15:25.585 --> 00:15:26.635
that we saw in chapter two.

313
00:15:27.045 --> 00:15:28.555
Eli's sons. They're already done.

314
00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:33.455
So look at what happened, starting in verse eight.

315
00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:38.555
And the Lord called Samuel again the third time,

316
00:15:39.015 --> 00:15:40.515
and he arose and went to Eli

317
00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:42.435
and said, here I am for you, called me.

318
00:15:42.665 --> 00:15:45.755
Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy.

319
00:15:45.855 --> 00:15:46.915
Eli finally caught on.

320
00:15:48.345 --> 00:15:51.355
Finally, finally could hear after three tries.

321
00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:57.875
Now, verse nine. Therefore, Eli said to Samuel, go lie down,

322
00:15:57.895 --> 00:16:00.755
and if he calls you, you shall say, speak Lord

323
00:16:00.775 --> 00:16:01.955
for your servant hears.

324
00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.995
So Samuel went and laid down in his place, and the Lord came

325
00:16:06.015 --> 00:16:08.015
and stood calling us.

326
00:16:08.015 --> 00:16:09.415
At other times, Samuel, Samuel

327
00:16:09.515 --> 00:16:11.935
and Samuel said, speak for your servant.

328
00:16:12.185 --> 00:16:16.535
Hears. Then the Lord said to Samuel, behold, I'm about

329
00:16:16.535 --> 00:16:18.655
to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone

330
00:16:18.655 --> 00:16:20.735
who hears it will tingle on that day.

331
00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.335
I will fulfill against Eli

332
00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:23.975
and all that I've spoken concerning his

333
00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:25.615
house from beginning to end.

334
00:16:25.855 --> 00:16:28.015
I declare to him, I'm about to punish his house forever

335
00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:29.815
for the iniquity that he knew,

336
00:16:29.815 --> 00:16:32.295
because his sons were blaspheming.

337
00:16:32.395 --> 00:16:33.895
God. He did not restrain them.

338
00:16:34.445 --> 00:16:36.895
Therefore, I swear the house of Eli, that the iniquity

339
00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:39.895
of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice

340
00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:42.095
or offering forever, meaning they're done.

341
00:16:44.035 --> 00:16:45.815
Samuel lay until morning.

342
00:16:46.045 --> 00:16:47.975
Then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord,

343
00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:49.095
which he did every day.

344
00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:52.775
And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli naturally.

345
00:16:54.085 --> 00:16:56.705
But Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son.

346
00:16:57.165 --> 00:16:58.865
And he said, here I am. Same way.

347
00:16:58.865 --> 00:17:00.225
It just worked out that night before.

348
00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:03.105
And Eli said, what was it that he told you?

349
00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:06.105
Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you

350
00:17:06.105 --> 00:17:08.345
and more also if you hide anything from me,

351
00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:09.625
of all that he told you.

352
00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:13.775
So Samuel told him everything hid nothing from him,

353
00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:16.855
and Eli said, it is the Lord.

354
00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:19.215
Let him do what seems good to him.

355
00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:26.795
So a total of four times God calls to Samuel.

356
00:17:28.275 --> 00:17:30.495
But the fourth time did you see something was different

357
00:17:30.495 --> 00:17:32.275
about it, right?

358
00:17:32.275 --> 00:17:34.835
Verse 10, it says, God came

359
00:17:34.935 --> 00:17:37.845
and stood like in the room.

360
00:17:38.915 --> 00:17:42.765
Just, just think about this, the infinite sovereign

361
00:17:43.305 --> 00:17:45.845
God came into this little boy's room.

362
00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:53.045
Now, it wasn't to scare him like solely right?

363
00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:56.165
Walking into the room like surprise, like not

364
00:17:56.165 --> 00:17:57.365
to scare Samuel.

365
00:17:57.465 --> 00:17:58.525
That's not the point of this.

366
00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:02.625
It was to draw near to him.

367
00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:06.535
Just come close to Samuel.

368
00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:13.225
Isn't that amazing? But but isn't that like God too?

369
00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:18.205
'cause Samuel is sleeping, staying,

370
00:18:18.355 --> 00:18:20.605
working in the very location

371
00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:23.285
where the most wicked things in all

372
00:18:23.285 --> 00:18:24.285
of Israel were happening.

373
00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:29.245
Like in the midst of all of the junk, all of the carnage

374
00:18:29.245 --> 00:18:32.405
and sin by Eli and his sons right there.

375
00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:36.725
God shows up and meets with Samuel right there.

376
00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:44.335
He came close. He shared his presence with this young boy.

377
00:18:44.855 --> 00:18:46.255
'cause he was calling him to himself.

378
00:18:46.255 --> 00:18:48.335
Listen, just, this is a side note.

379
00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:50.855
Don't let all the junk

380
00:18:50.955 --> 00:18:53.975
around us keep us from drawing near to our father.

381
00:18:57.645 --> 00:19:01.985
Listen, God is not concerned about all the political drama,

382
00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:04.825
all the wars in the world.

383
00:19:06.185 --> 00:19:09.765
He, he's not fretting over your extended family issues

384
00:19:09.835 --> 00:19:11.205
that just keep coming up, right?

385
00:19:11.265 --> 00:19:15.965
He, he's not. He, he cares for you and for me.

386
00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:22.445
In the middle of all that, if you are his child,

387
00:19:23.305 --> 00:19:25.365
he wants to come near to you

388
00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:28.725
and bring peace with his presence.

389
00:19:30.015 --> 00:19:34.465
Even in all that, don't let that stuff keep you from him.

390
00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:38.385
Don't let that stuff distract you from him.

391
00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:44.325
Eli and his sons were unfaithful priests.

392
00:19:44.325 --> 00:19:47.845
And so what God did, he installed a new line of priests

393
00:19:47.845 --> 00:19:49.725
through this servant hearted boy

394
00:19:50.755 --> 00:19:53.125
with a ready, faithful heart.

395
00:19:55.165 --> 00:19:58.065
So what Luke 14 reminds us, everyone

396
00:19:58.065 --> 00:20:00.505
who exalts himself will be humbled,

397
00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:05.045
but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.

398
00:20:06.555 --> 00:20:11.505
Eli's sons humbled. Samuel was lifted up.

399
00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:16.725
Well, here's what happens next in this narrative, it's,

400
00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:18.925
it's very similar actually to Jesus' early

401
00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:19.965
life in the Gospels.

402
00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:22.605
We don't see much like things kind

403
00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:25.805
of fast forward from early life, childhood Jesus,

404
00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:27.245
and all of a sudden he's 30.

405
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:28.765
Like what happened there?

406
00:20:29.515 --> 00:20:31.285
It's pretty similar with Samuel actually.

407
00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:34.365
We don't see much between Samuel's

408
00:20:34.365 --> 00:20:35.805
childhood and his adulthood.

409
00:20:37.155 --> 00:20:39.005
It's what you'll see here starting in verse 19

410
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:44.305
of chapter three, and Samuel grew.

411
00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:47.805
That's it. That's all we get.

412
00:20:49.065 --> 00:20:50.645
So all of a sudden, he's an adult now

413
00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:52.485
because the Lord was with him

414
00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:54.845
and let none of his words fall to the ground.

415
00:20:56.795 --> 00:20:59.255
And all Israel from Dan to Bes Sheba knew

416
00:20:59.255 --> 00:21:01.615
that Samuel was established as a prophet of the Lord.

417
00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:04.865
And the Lord appeared again at Shiloh,

418
00:21:04.885 --> 00:21:07.705
for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh

419
00:21:07.925 --> 00:21:09.065
by the word of the Lord.

420
00:21:10.795 --> 00:21:14.335
And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.

421
00:21:17.455 --> 00:21:20.155
So what God had promised to do to Eli

422
00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.795
and his sons had not happened yet.

423
00:21:21.795 --> 00:21:24.715
We'll get there next week. But what we start

424
00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:27.235
to see is a glimpse of this new day

425
00:21:27.235 --> 00:21:30.105
that God was bringing in Israel, right?

426
00:21:30.105 --> 00:21:31.105
Things are different now.

427
00:21:31.445 --> 00:21:32.665
Things are starting to happen,

428
00:21:33.005 --> 00:21:35.505
and it was through a miraculous birth.

429
00:21:35.525 --> 00:21:40.055
Did you catch that Baron, Hannah brings about Samuel, right?

430
00:21:40.075 --> 00:21:43.375
The miraculous birth through

431
00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:45.015
that God was again among his people.

432
00:21:45.675 --> 00:21:48.695
God was again speaking, God was again meeting

433
00:21:48.695 --> 00:21:51.455
with his people at the tabernacle again.

434
00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:53.735
And he did it all through this man named Samuel.

435
00:21:57.515 --> 00:21:58.975
Now, actually, we've seen I, I did kind

436
00:21:58.975 --> 00:22:00.255
of joke about Samuel grew.

437
00:22:00.425 --> 00:22:02.855
We've seen a thread of Samuel growing

438
00:22:03.505 --> 00:22:04.935
throughout the narrative already.

439
00:22:06.905 --> 00:22:09.355
Chapter two, verse 21.

440
00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:12.195
He grew in the presence of the Lord.

441
00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:16.135
Chapter two, verse 26 actually says it this way,

442
00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:20.215
the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature

443
00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:23.015
and in favor with the Lord and also with man.

444
00:22:24.515 --> 00:22:27.255
So Samuel was growing up physically as children do,

445
00:22:27.435 --> 00:22:29.175
but he was also growing spiritually

446
00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:31.535
because God had a plan for his life, something

447
00:22:31.565 --> 00:22:32.895
that he knew was coming.

448
00:22:33.115 --> 00:22:35.015
He wanted Samuel prepared for it,

449
00:22:35.115 --> 00:22:37.535
and ultimately he was to perform this

450
00:22:38.105 --> 00:22:39.855
quasi priest role for a little bit.

451
00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:44.655
But more than that, what we see in Samuel was that God

452
00:22:45.165 --> 00:22:48.895
initiated a new authority in prophets.

453
00:22:50.875 --> 00:22:55.065
This was the shift that they needed a priest

454
00:22:55.485 --> 00:22:56.585
to stand before God

455
00:22:56.585 --> 00:23:00.145
and kind of do that ceremonial role, holy kind of role.

456
00:23:00.565 --> 00:23:03.185
Yes, but they also needed prophets

457
00:23:03.185 --> 00:23:06.465
and a new authority came through those.

458
00:23:06.605 --> 00:23:08.265
Now, Moses was a prophet.

459
00:23:09.035 --> 00:23:11.505
There might've been a couple others throughout the history

460
00:23:11.505 --> 00:23:13.145
of Israel, but Samuel was really the

461
00:23:13.145 --> 00:23:14.265
first prominent prophet.

462
00:23:16.135 --> 00:23:18.595
He shows up and he has this role.

463
00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:19.715
So we need to ask the question,

464
00:23:19.715 --> 00:23:20.915
okay, what's the role of the prophet?

465
00:23:20.945 --> 00:23:23.925
What do they do? What actually did God do

466
00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:25.845
with this in the new authority?

467
00:23:25.845 --> 00:23:27.245
Where did that authority come from?

468
00:23:29.195 --> 00:23:30.845
Well, we learn a lot from it just right

469
00:23:30.845 --> 00:23:31.965
here in these couple of verses.

470
00:23:33.225 --> 00:23:36.535
First, we discovered that the prophet's authority only came

471
00:23:36.535 --> 00:23:37.535
through the word of God.

472
00:23:37.755 --> 00:23:38.895
It only came through God's word.

473
00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:45.685
This new authority was through God's word.

474
00:23:46.315 --> 00:23:47.365
It's all over this section.

475
00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:50.565
Actually like verse 19, look at this.

476
00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:53.605
The Samuel grew, the Lord was with him

477
00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:56.885
and let none of his words fall to the ground.

478
00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:59.285
Why were, why was Samuel's word so powerful?

479
00:23:59.515 --> 00:24:00.765
Because the Lord was with him.

480
00:24:01.705 --> 00:24:05.505
And then in verse 21, the Lord revealed himself to Samuel

481
00:24:05.925 --> 00:24:07.425
by the word of the Lord.

482
00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.685
That's why at this point,

483
00:24:11.965 --> 00:24:14.245
whenever this is all of Israel from Dan North

484
00:24:14.545 --> 00:24:17.965
to be Sheba in the South, the whole population,

485
00:24:19.425 --> 00:24:20.955
they all knew that Samuel had been

486
00:24:20.955 --> 00:24:22.075
established as a prophet of the Lord.

487
00:24:23.105 --> 00:24:26.515
They all knew that he was speaking God's words.

488
00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:28.195
That's what they could understand,

489
00:24:28.195 --> 00:24:29.515
because this was a new day.

490
00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:31.955
It used to be. Remember chapter three verse one.

491
00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:33.715
The word of the Lord was rare.

492
00:24:35.545 --> 00:24:36.765
Now, by the end of this, Samuel,

493
00:24:37.155 --> 00:24:39.005
he's speaking God's word and everybody knows it.

494
00:24:40.255 --> 00:24:41.625
Something has been different.

495
00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:46.895
Faithful ministry back then.

496
00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:48.815
But listen, it's true just as much today,

497
00:24:49.095 --> 00:24:51.335
faithful ministry only comes through hearing

498
00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:53.855
and speaking God's very words.

499
00:24:54.805 --> 00:24:56.985
That's where the authority lie back then.

500
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:59.385
That's where it lays today as much

501
00:25:00.595 --> 00:25:04.005
it's gotta be based on God's words alone, which is

502
00:25:04.005 --> 00:25:06.925
what he was speaking regularly as a prophet.

503
00:25:08.435 --> 00:25:12.775
But it wasn't just to himself. It was towards God's people.

504
00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:15.925
That's what this new authority was for.

505
00:25:16.745 --> 00:25:20.165
It was through God's word to God's people.

506
00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:25.145
He was called to be with God. How cool that would be.

507
00:25:26.005 --> 00:25:29.105
But that wasn't it. There was something more.

508
00:25:31.015 --> 00:25:33.635
It says none of his spoken words fell to the ground.

509
00:25:34.395 --> 00:25:35.955
Everyone knew he was a prophet, meaning

510
00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:39.035
what he was doing was he was speaking words to people.

511
00:25:40.255 --> 00:25:41.905
They were coming true people could identify

512
00:25:41.965 --> 00:25:43.105
he was a true prophet.

513
00:25:43.405 --> 00:25:46.145
He was speaking truth and encouragement.

514
00:25:46.415 --> 00:25:50.105
Then chapter four, the word of Samuel came to all Israel.

515
00:25:50.135 --> 00:25:53.065
This is all setting us up for the whole book of Samuel.

516
00:25:54.365 --> 00:25:58.825
How he plays this role of God's mouthpiece

517
00:25:58.825 --> 00:26:00.025
to God's people.

518
00:26:01.955 --> 00:26:03.965
That Samuel speaks the very words of God,

519
00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:05.965
encouragement when they needed it,

520
00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:10.985
but also rebuke when they needed it, correction,

521
00:26:11.585 --> 00:26:12.665
teaching when they needed it.

522
00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:15.825
He was receiving God's word and speaking God's word.

523
00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:17.345
He had to do both sides of that.

524
00:26:18.565 --> 00:26:20.745
He couldn't just do encouraging.

525
00:26:20.965 --> 00:26:23.705
He had to correct as needed.

526
00:26:25.255 --> 00:26:26.395
So again, unlike

527
00:26:26.395 --> 00:26:28.955
before, now everybody knows God's speaking again.

528
00:26:28.985 --> 00:26:30.635
He's with us, praise God

529
00:26:32.905 --> 00:26:34.555
through God's word to God's people.

530
00:26:34.555 --> 00:26:35.915
But there was one more aspect to this.

531
00:26:37.905 --> 00:26:40.125
We need to see this prophetic authority was

532
00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:41.685
that it accompanied God's king.

533
00:26:44.445 --> 00:26:47.385
God was doing this new work, new authority,

534
00:26:47.575 --> 00:26:50.025
that it accompanied God's king.

535
00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:54.605
Now, you may be perceptive and you say, we're not there yet.

536
00:26:55.965 --> 00:26:57.745
We don't have kings yet here in one Samuel

537
00:26:57.745 --> 00:26:59.705
that's coming in like chapter eight or later, right?

538
00:26:59.725 --> 00:27:04.225
So how, how do you tie it together here, watch this.

539
00:27:04.285 --> 00:27:06.265
Go back to chapter two, verse 35.

540
00:27:07.765 --> 00:27:09.175
This was said about the priests.

541
00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:13.425
Remember, I will raise up

542
00:27:13.425 --> 00:27:16.185
for myself a faithful priest who shall do according to

543
00:27:16.185 --> 00:27:17.665
what is in my heart, in my mind.

544
00:27:18.145 --> 00:27:19.505
I will build him a sure house.

545
00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:23.345
He shall go in and out before my anointed forever.

546
00:27:24.415 --> 00:27:27.485
That phrase, my anointed

547
00:27:28.145 --> 00:27:30.405
is a common phrase in the Old Testament for the king.

548
00:27:31.825 --> 00:27:34.235
Like if you're looking for a tie, it's right there.

549
00:27:36.295 --> 00:27:37.755
The priest or the prophet,

550
00:27:37.815 --> 00:27:41.315
or maybe both, would anoint the king on God's behalf.

551
00:27:41.455 --> 00:27:42.835
He would say, here's who the king is,

552
00:27:42.975 --> 00:27:45.275
and they would anoint with oil and have a big ceremony.

553
00:27:45.295 --> 00:27:47.395
That's, we'll see it later in one Samuel.

554
00:27:49.415 --> 00:27:51.235
And even though this is prior to that one,

555
00:27:51.265 --> 00:27:54.635
king Saul being anointed, there's something happening here

556
00:27:54.635 --> 00:27:56.955
that's foreshadowing what's going to come,

557
00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:01.145
because there's a shift in this book

558
00:28:01.145 --> 00:28:03.825
that's happening towards a monarchy, towards that kingship.

559
00:28:04.405 --> 00:28:08.065
And even though it was not God's desire for them

560
00:28:08.125 --> 00:28:10.025
to have a king, he was their king.

561
00:28:10.045 --> 00:28:12.665
He shall reign over them. He didn't want that.

562
00:28:12.765 --> 00:28:14.665
He was not surprised by it either.

563
00:28:16.475 --> 00:28:17.935
And what he did is he set up rules

564
00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:20.335
and regulations to limit the power

565
00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:21.535
of the king when it happened,

566
00:28:21.635 --> 00:28:23.335
but also to keep that king holy.

567
00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:30.215
The prophet was who he used to do that a prophet was

568
00:28:30.215 --> 00:28:32.975
who would stand with the king

569
00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:36.895
and speak God's word, both corrective

570
00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:40.775
and encouraging all of that to the king and the king.

571
00:28:40.915 --> 00:28:43.335
The monarchy would not work without a

572
00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:45.335
prophet standing there with him.

573
00:28:47.655 --> 00:28:49.435
In fact, go read the rest of the Old Testament.

574
00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:52.125
You read the story of the kings,

575
00:28:52.385 --> 00:28:55.965
and every time it went south is when they said, no,

576
00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:57.885
I'm not listening to you, prophet.

577
00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:01.755
And they just disregarded the words of God

578
00:29:01.755 --> 00:29:04.835
through the prophet that God had assigned to speak the words

579
00:29:04.835 --> 00:29:06.995
of God, and they walked their own way.

580
00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:09.075
And everything goes terribly.

581
00:29:11.055 --> 00:29:13.315
It does not work without a prophet.

582
00:29:14.055 --> 00:29:15.435
And Samuel was the first one.

583
00:29:16.405 --> 00:29:19.225
Samuel was the one who filled that role first.

584
00:29:23.175 --> 00:29:26.895
Now, the question I asked

585
00:29:26.895 --> 00:29:28.975
before the question we need to ask right now,

586
00:29:30.265 --> 00:29:31.275
what do we do with all this?

587
00:29:33.695 --> 00:29:34.695
I mean, we could easily sit here

588
00:29:34.695 --> 00:29:36.215
and be like, man, that was 30 minutes

589
00:29:36.215 --> 00:29:37.255
of a good history lesson.

590
00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:39.455
That's gonna set us up for the rest of the book. Awesome.

591
00:29:40.285 --> 00:29:44.755
What do? What do we do with that? Like it, it's natural.

592
00:29:45.135 --> 00:29:47.515
You read the Bible. Sometimes you kind of get there like,

593
00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:49.155
oh, okay, great.

594
00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:53.255
What do we do with this? Now?

595
00:29:53.255 --> 00:29:54.495
Part of it is to set up the rest,

596
00:29:55.075 --> 00:29:56.695
the call background of Samuel.

597
00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:58.415
That's important as we go forward. Yes.

598
00:30:00.185 --> 00:30:02.245
But then the question, is it merely to remind us

599
00:30:02.245 --> 00:30:04.525
of the tragedy of sin and the blessing of obedience?

600
00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:06.885
Okay, well, that that's part of it. Yeah, that can be good.

601
00:30:08.845 --> 00:30:12.705
Or is it mainly to like spur us on, like Samuel, listen

602
00:30:12.725 --> 00:30:13.745
to the call of God.

603
00:30:14.005 --> 00:30:15.785
You find the call of God in your life

604
00:30:15.785 --> 00:30:17.065
and you serve him with all you got.

605
00:30:17.485 --> 00:30:19.225
Ah, it's, it's a bit of a stretch.

606
00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:21.025
But yeah, you could, you could make that.

607
00:30:23.965 --> 00:30:25.205
I think for us today,

608
00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:29.235
we're not in the theocracy that Israel was.

609
00:30:30.585 --> 00:30:32.455
We're followers of Christ now.

610
00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:36.565
So the question we need to ask is how do we see our savior,

611
00:30:36.905 --> 00:30:38.125
our redeemer through this?

612
00:30:40.095 --> 00:30:44.425
Is it just history? Or how do we see Jesus?

613
00:30:45.405 --> 00:30:48.025
How does this lift our eyes to our savior?

614
00:30:50.585 --> 00:30:53.835
Well, lemme take you on a journey towards that.

615
00:30:54.195 --> 00:30:57.595
Remember how a couple weeks ago I said, Samuel is a type

616
00:30:58.095 --> 00:31:02.975
of Christ, meaning we see things in Samuel's

617
00:31:02.975 --> 00:31:06.255
life, that foreshadows aspects we'll

618
00:31:06.255 --> 00:31:07.695
understand about the Messiah.

619
00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:12.015
So there's pieces of Samuel's life that point us to Jesus.

620
00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:16.905
Even something as simple as chapter two, verse 26.

621
00:31:17.345 --> 00:31:19.945
Remember the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature

622
00:31:20.065 --> 00:31:22.985
and in favor with the Lord and also with man.

623
00:31:24.455 --> 00:31:26.025
That might sound familiar

624
00:31:28.895 --> 00:31:33.505
because Luke chapter two, verse 52 says this,

625
00:31:34.835 --> 00:31:37.905
Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature

626
00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:40.065
and in favor with God

627
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.065
and man

628
00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:46.055
sounds familiar.

629
00:31:47.895 --> 00:31:52.215
I think Luke was making an intentional connection back

630
00:31:52.215 --> 00:31:55.995
to Samuel, that he was linking Jesus

631
00:31:56.585 --> 00:31:57.715
with Samuel.

632
00:31:58.075 --> 00:31:59.515
'cause just think about what we saw in Samuel,

633
00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:00.955
even just today, right?

634
00:32:01.535 --> 00:32:04.235
Eli and his sons were rejected from the

635
00:32:04.235 --> 00:32:05.995
priesthood who fills the gap.

636
00:32:06.775 --> 00:32:10.595
Samuel, as God installs new

637
00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.515
authority in prophets.

638
00:32:12.615 --> 00:32:14.115
Who was the first one? Samuel.

639
00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:19.705
And then later God would anoint the first king of Israel.

640
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:21.585
Who did he use to do that?

641
00:32:21.765 --> 00:32:23.905
Who would be the one to go in and out before the king

642
00:32:23.905 --> 00:32:25.785
and speak God's truth to the King Samuel?

643
00:32:27.855 --> 00:32:30.915
So Samuel was a faithful priest, a faithful prophet.

644
00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:33.075
He was also involved with the kingship.

645
00:32:33.095 --> 00:32:34.275
He was all of those things.

646
00:32:34.615 --> 00:32:37.595
The problem was he was limited in all of those things

647
00:32:39.905 --> 00:32:41.315
because what did God want?

648
00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:43.715
He wanted a sure house.

649
00:32:44.455 --> 00:32:47.915
He wanted a forever presence before him.

650
00:32:48.135 --> 00:32:51.955
He wanted someone to speak God's words eternally.

651
00:32:53.545 --> 00:32:54.565
Samuel couldn't do that.

652
00:32:57.165 --> 00:32:59.025
In fact, no human born of a man

653
00:32:59.025 --> 00:33:01.065
and a woman could ever do that.

654
00:33:01.155 --> 00:33:04.065
We're limited. Every one of us. No one could.

655
00:33:04.365 --> 00:33:07.225
So what Samuel's life does is he points us

656
00:33:07.365 --> 00:33:11.585
to the truly faithful priest, to the truly faithful prophet,

657
00:33:11.845 --> 00:33:14.705
to the one true king whose name is Jesus the Messiah.

658
00:33:15.815 --> 00:33:18.425
When we look at Samuel's life, we can look forward

659
00:33:18.765 --> 00:33:23.185
and we can see Jesus, the one who on our behalf, went

660
00:33:23.185 --> 00:33:26.465
behind the curtain so he could rip it open by dying

661
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.425
on the cross and shedding his blood to forgive us

662
00:33:29.605 --> 00:33:33.265
and give us access to God as the priest we need.

663
00:33:34.765 --> 00:33:39.185
His life points us to the true very word

664
00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:42.225
of God, not just who speaks the words of God,

665
00:33:42.285 --> 00:33:46.185
who is the word of God as the prophet we need,

666
00:33:48.155 --> 00:33:50.295
and Samuel's life points us to the one

667
00:33:50.635 --> 00:33:54.975
who carries the government of the world on his shoulders,

668
00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:59.055
the king we need.

669
00:34:00.715 --> 00:34:03.455
So yes, we are praising God.

670
00:34:03.835 --> 00:34:06.255
For Samuel, how he got God used him

671
00:34:06.275 --> 00:34:09.415
to reset Israel in some massive ways, even

672
00:34:09.515 --> 00:34:10.775
to anoint King David

673
00:34:11.035 --> 00:34:13.735
and that line through which the Messiah would come one day,

674
00:34:13.915 --> 00:34:15.935
God did all that through Samuel,

675
00:34:16.155 --> 00:34:18.855
but in the end, Jesus is the priest we need.

676
00:34:19.025 --> 00:34:20.695
Jesus is the prophet we need.

677
00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:23.655
Jesus is the king we need because he

678
00:34:23.655 --> 00:34:26.455
and only he can reign forever and ever.

679
00:34:26.475 --> 00:34:29.855
That's what we need, church. That's why we sing.

680
00:34:30.315 --> 00:34:32.695
That's why we live, because he is who he is

681
00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:33.775
and He's done what He's done.

682
00:34:33.995 --> 00:34:36.895
That's what Samuel's life points us to.
