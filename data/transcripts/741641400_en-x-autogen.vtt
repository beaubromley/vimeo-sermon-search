00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.400

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.000
the god like Yahweh?

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.400
The god of wrath the god of Mercy The

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.900
God Who reaches down to unworthy

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.100
people.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.600
Well church it is good to see you this morning I'm glad

7

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.300
the meat of the book now, so if you're not already there go

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500
ahead and turn to the Book of Micah in your copy of

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.400
God's word it is in the Old Testament, you can find it

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.300
just right of middle somewhere in there. You can find

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.600
middle and then turn right bunch a little prophets in there the Book

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.200
of Micah

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.600
Put a bookmark. There will be there for the next few months as

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
we get started today, though.

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.600
many of you have heard

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
already that part of my life story involves being

21
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.300
deeply broken over sin at around the age

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.700
of 20. So we're welcoming college students. That was a huge part

23
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600
of my journey as well College was

24
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.800
and

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.400
I don't have shared this a lot with you've been here for a while. But but

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.200
really this is what God did in my life and so I can't

27
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.900
help but share what he's done in it. She had

28
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600
grown up in a small town in, Northwest, Oklahoma.

29
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.300
Where all I knew all the right Church

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.600
answers and and I had to to kind of expected to

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.900
be living a certain way publicly, but it

32
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
was not really in my heart at all.

33
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.500
See, I externally I looked alright, I had

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.200
I was a good church kid. I was a leader of FCA at school

35
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.800
the whole thing that we do but internally.

36
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000
I was rebelling against God in the lust of

37
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.100
My Flesh and the pride of my heart.

38
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.900
I thought I was the best at everything. I was pursuing selfishly

39
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.000
all the the desires that I

40
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
had and was never really pursuing Jesus

41
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.700
but something changed.

42
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.500
a 20

43
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.400
and you know what it was.

44
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.300
It was finally seeing God for

45
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.900
who he is.

46
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.800
Which then led me to in light of that see my

47
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.600
sin for what it is in comparison to who

48
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.900
he is.

49
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.300
And I take no credit for that. That was God's work in my heart. It

50
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.600
wasn't like I was searching it out. God met me and changed

51
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.400
it and he used a few other people in my life to finally

52
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.000
help me see what repentance actually means.

53
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.300
And it wasn't until that moment that I finally understood the gravity

54
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.600
the weight of sin and how heavy

55
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.300
God's judgment felt.

56
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.400
That I was about to lose everything. I was about to lose the

57
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.000
woman that thankfully is now my wife. I was about to lose football.

58
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.400
I was about to lose future Ministry opportunities. I

59
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.300
was I was heading down a path that with Cliff was on the other side.

60
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.200
I was falling off.

61
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.500
But what that weight of sin also did is

62
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.800
it then magnified how freeing it

63
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.300
felt whenever God washed over

64
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.700
me with his forgiving Grace.

65
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.300
It's like the scales right how low this one got but how

66
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300
great this one was on the other side of it.

67
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.100
So what we're gonna find today in Micah chapter one.

68
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.500
Is a group of people who had turned their backs on that

69
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.000
same grace and mercy.

70
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.700
Like sheep, they'd gone. Astray. They'd each turned

71
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.400
to their own way along this process and

72
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.300
what we'll learn about God today is how

73
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.800
he views sin like that.

74
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.600
How that Rebellion is seen in his eyes?

75
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.300
And so last week as we started the book we discovered that Micah was

76
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.600
a prophet around 730 BC primarily to

77
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.500
the southern Kingdom of Judah. Remember the Well Done

78
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.900
map, right the southern Kingdom of Judah and and

79
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.300
he was speaking primarily to them with Jerusalem as

80
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.000
it's Capital, but he also referenced the Northern Kingdom of

81
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
Israel, which its capital was Samaria. So he he was kind

82
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.700
of mostly South but also to North and so so

83
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.700
he as a prophet his job remember was

84
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.300
to communicate God's words to his

85
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.600
people

86
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600
Now usually that was judgment on sin, but it also included

87
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.300
God's promises God's assurances. He

88
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.900
was speaking what God Said to the people.

89
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800
And so what Micah is a collection of those speeches he

90
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.500
would give and so to give us a feel for how God spoke

91
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.100
through Micah. I want to start by reading the entire first chapter of

92
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.500
Micah because we need to understand this

93
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500
and learn from where they failed and how we

94
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.400
can not fail but also what they did, right and so we

95
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.100
are gonna learn from this by the way, as I read

96
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.300
this reading the names in the Bible is just as difficult

97
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.200
for me. So let's just Journey Through This Together.

98
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.100
This is Micah chapter one. I'm going to start with verse 1

99
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.200
we did last week, but it'll give us some context.

100
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.200
The word of the Lord that came to Micah of morrisheth in

101
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.000
the days of jotham. Ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of

102
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.000
Judah which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

103
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.700
Here's what he said.

104
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.200
Here you peoples all of you.

105
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.200
Pay attention. Oh Earth and all that is in it and let

106
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.600
the Lord God be a witness against you the Lord from

107
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.300
his holy Temple behold. The Lord is coming out

108
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.600
of his place. He will come down and tread upon

109
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.800
the eye places of the Earth.

110
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.500
And the mountains will melt under him The Valleys

111
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.900
will split open like Wax before the fire like Waters

112
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.000
poured down a steep place.

113
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.500
All this is for the transgression of Jacob for

114
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.100
the sins of the House of Israel. What is the

115
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.900
transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria?

116
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.300
What is the high place of Judah is it not Jerusalem?

117
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.500
Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the Open Country

118
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.300
a place for planting Vineyards. I'll pour down

119
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.300
her stones into the valley uncover her foundation.

120
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.100
All her carved images shall be beaten to Pieces all

121
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.000
their wages shall be burned with fire and all

122
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.400
their Idols. I will lay waste.

123
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.500
For from the fee of a prostitute she gathered them and to the

124
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.800
fee of a prostitute they shall return.

125
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.200
For this I will lament and wail. I

126
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.100
will go stripped and naked I'll make lamentation like the jackals morning

127
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.400
like the ostriches.

128
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.600
For her wound is incurable. It has come to Judah.

129
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.800
It has reached to the gate of my people to Jerusalem.

130
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.100
Tell it not in gas weep. Not

131
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.900
at all in best La Afra roll yourselves

132
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.700
in the dust pass on your way inhabitants of

133
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.700
shafir in nakedness and shame.

134
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.200
The inhabitants of Za Anan do not come

135
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.300
out.

136
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.100
The lamentation of Beth Ezell shall take

137
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.600
away from you. It's standing place.

138
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200
For the inhabitants of moroth wait anxiously for good.

139
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.900
Because disasters come down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.

140
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.700
Harness, the steeds to the Chariots inhabitants of lakeish. It

141
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.300
was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion for

142
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.400
in you were found the transgressions of Israel.

143
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.400
Therefore you shall give parting gifts to more shift gas.

144
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.100
The houses of axib shall be a deceitful thing to the

145
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.800
Kings of Israel.

146
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.200
I will again bring a conqueror to you inhabitants of Marisha the

147
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.100
glory of Israel shall come to adullam.

148
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.200
Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair for the children of

149
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.200
your Delight make yourself as bald as the eagle

150
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.700
for they shall go from you into exile.

151
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.300
So as we look at what God is saying here in this

152
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.700
first chapter our first step here is to understand some truths

153
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.500
about them. Like we we take them first. We

154
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.700
look at the context. What does it mean there? First of

155
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.200
the people involved actually here both Israel and

156
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.000
Judah but also what it teaches about God.

157
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.100
By the way, anytime you see the word as you're reading the Bible the word

158
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.400
Lord or God in in all caps, but small

159
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.600
anytime. You see that it's referring

160
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600
to Yahweh.

161
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.400
That's God's covenant name. Remember that Exodus 3

162
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.000
shows. He revealed to Moses Moses. Like what do I

163
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.200
tell them your name? Is? He says tell him I'm Yahweh. I

164
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.400
am.

165
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.900
That's his personal Holy Name. The one who chose Israel

166
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.300
to be his possession to be his representative

167
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.400
on the earth. He said that's who I am.

168
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.200
Tell everybody who it is.

169
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.100
So this is Yahweh who's being referred to here that little

170
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.200
caps, right? And so what we learn right away in verses 2 through

171
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.600
4. Is that this Yahweh. He is God.

172
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.400
Yahweh is God and you're like, yeah, I know.

173
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.100
Okay. Well, it's simple I know but you see the picture of who

174
00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.800
God is here.

175
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.800
He says here. He's God over all people. He's

176
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.900
God over all the Earth. He's over everything that's

177
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.300
in it, which means if he is that then

178
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.800
we must submit to him.

179
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.300
And you see how huge he really is in verse

180
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:17.700
4.

181
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.600
Right the mountains melting the valley splitting

182
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.300
students. I was thinking about this. It's like when we were driving a student Camp,

183
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.500
you're going through all those mountains all that imagine those all just

184
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.100
melting down around us.

185
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800
Into the valleys and becoming a flat plane.

186
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.100
That's the essence that because God was walking on top of the

187
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.400
mountains that's happening. That's the image we get of who

188
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.100
Yahweh. God is

189
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.700
yet.

190
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.100
Even though he is God.

191
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.900
What we learn is that Judah and Israel still rebelled against

192
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.200
him.

193
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.600
That's God. That's the picture of God yet.

194
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.400
they rebelled

195
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.700
verse 5 says Israel rebelled against him by transgressing his

196
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.000
Commandments by making Samaria their

197
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.200
place of worship in the northern kingdom. It was supposed

198
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.100
to be Jerusalem where the temple was but they said no we're going

199
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.000
to do it in Samaria.

200
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.400
So that was their transgression. But yet in verse 5

201
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.300
Micah says the same thing about Jerusalem. He says

202
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.200
Jerusalem is the high place of Judah. That's

203
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.700
a derogatory term.

204
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.800
It means false worship was happening there just

205
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.100
like it was in Samaria.

206
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.700
You see in verse 9 it says the wound this

207
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.400
this scar scourge of sin

208
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.900
has come to Judah.

209
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.500
It has reached to the gate of my people to Jerusalem.

210
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.600
Same in verse 12. There's disaster coming because of

211
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.600
this in Jerusalem. That means Judah is

212
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.500
not immune to the same thing that's happening

213
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500
in the northern kingdom because what was happening is that

214
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.100
as the northern kingdom was experiencing this this

215
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.800
judgment of God and the Assyrians

216
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.300
were coming into their land. They're starting to get taken over

217
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.200
the people in the south in Judah. They're watching

218
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.600
Fox News and they saw man. Look what's happening in the north. Look

219
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.000
the judgments coming. The judgment is coming. We're

220
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.700
okay because we have Jerusalem

221
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.600
But that leads us to another truth to learn here about God is that Yahweh

222
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.000
is Holy.

223
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.400
Yahweh is Holy

224
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.200
now when we hear that word in our day today, we

225
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.000
think we think sinlessness perfection.

226
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.500
That's not wrong, but that's not actually what it

227
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.800
meant. Originally. It means separated.

228
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.500
it means other

229
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.300
distinct

230
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.600
Like when you go to Grandma's house and the China is in that special cabinet

231
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.600
over there. Nobody ever touches it it's different. It's distinct. It's

232
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.100
held apart, right? That's the idea of holy

233
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.500
is different. So we say God is Holy.

234
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.200
We mean he is completely different than we are.

235
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.300
He's set apart from us the image

236
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.600
we get of being up on the mountain. He's up there. We're down here.

237
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.500
It's the whole theme of the this series

238
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.600
right the Mountaintop who can ascend

239
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.100
He is out. There. We are here.

240
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.200
In verses 2 and 3 we see Yahweh coming out of

241
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.400
his holy Temple, which is apparently up on the Mountain of God because he

242
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.400
comes down.

243
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.200
And Treads upon the high places of

244
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.500
the earth which can be in both size and like elevation mountains

245
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.200
and also false worship.

246
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.400
He treads on top of it.

247
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.500
He's holy.

248
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.400
In fact, he then calls his people to be holy and Leviticus 20

249
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.200
verse 26. He says be holy as I am

250
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.100
Holy not just perfect sinless. He says I

251
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.900
am distinct. You need to be distinct in your Worship

252
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.100
in your actions. This is who I've called you

253
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.000
and set you apart.

254
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.200
to be

255
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.300
yet.

256
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.700
They still turn to idols.

257
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.500
Yahweh is Holy yet. They

258
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.200
knowing he who he

259
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.500
is and what they're called to be. They still turned to idols.

260
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.700
It's vividly described here in verse 7.

261
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.400
He says all her carved images shall be beaten

262
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.400
to Pieces. All her wages shall be burned with fire all her

263
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.800
Idols. I will lay waste.

264
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.500
For from the fee of a prostitute she gathered them to the

265
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.600
fee of prostitute they shall return.

266
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.400
Earmuffs on that one, right? But anytime anytime you

267
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400
see that kind of language in Scripture.

268
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.900
It has to do with how God's holy people

269
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.000
polluted themselves with idolatry.

270
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.600
with false worship

271
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.300
that they began to worship other nations Gods which

272
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.200
aren't really Gods by the way, they began to worship and in doing

273
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.500
so they broke the Covenant that God had made with them at the

274
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.700
mountain of Sinai with Exodus the

275
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.400
whole scene with Moses up on the mountain. That's the Covenant they

276
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.400
made which by the way some people see that Mountain scene as

277
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.100
like a marriage covenant like a wedding ceremony where

278
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.300
God takes his bride Israel and

279
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.600
and initiates this Covenant with them.

280
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.900
It's like when you go to a wedding, right you've been to a wedding before and you you see

281
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.700
that vows are made between the two parties,

282
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.500
right a wedding is not just an excuse to party

283
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.600
and eat cake. That's not what a wedding is for.

284
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.600
We celebrate what has happened that commitments are made

285
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.400
between the groom and the bride, right?

286
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.700
You've seen it before they stand I take you and for richer

287
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.400
poor till death do us part like that whole thing back and

288
00:14:59.400 --> 00:14:59.700
forth, right?

289
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.400
It's laying out commitments that are made

290
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.600
in the marriage covenant.

291
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.000
That I promise this and you promise this and so thinking spiritually

292
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.300
now if that's what happened at Sinai for

293
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.300
these people when Israel and Judah went after all these

294
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.100
other gods. They worshiped Idols. What they

295
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.600
were doing is they were in essence committing spiritual adultery.

296
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.400
Saying forget the Covenant we want this.

297
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.500
But they'd forgotten something.

298
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.300
Since Yahweh is God since he's

299
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.400
holy Above All Else. He is worthy of

300
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.600
submission to him. That means he's the judge too.

301
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.600
He always also the judge.

302
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.700
And as he looks at their choices.

303
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.800
To try to find some benefit from these false gods

304
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.600
to pursue intimacy elsewhere in their lives.

305
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.800
He sits back and judges it to be sin.

306
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.400
In fact the word used in verse 5. He says it's transgression.

307
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.800
Which when you look back to the original Hebrew language for that word, it means Rebellion.

308
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.500
It means Revolt. It's a

309
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.200
defiants of authority. It's like when you you know, you've seen

310
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.500
that image of somebody shaking their fists and I'm never gonna do right. That's

311
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.100
the image. We get of the word transgression here. It's

312
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.100
not just missing the mark. They had

313
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.600
the audacity to spit in the face of God

314
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.100
almighty.

315
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.200
That's the that's the essence of sin. It's

316
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.500
not just missing the market. It's saying to your father. You can't

317
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.500
tell me what to do.

318
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.200
utter rebellion in essence

319
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.200
that's why they deserved God's judgment.

320
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.200
Yahweh is the judge and they deserved God's judgment.

321
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.000
Again verses 6 and 7 he says it.

322
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.700
I'll make Samaria. That's the Northern Kingdom capital a

323
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.400
heap in the Open Country a place for planting

324
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.400
Vineyards meaning like a flat land. I'll pour

325
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.200
down her stones in the valley uncover her foundations. I'm going

326
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.400
to turn the whole city upside down basically all are carved

327
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.300
images. She'll be beaten to pieces or wages burned with fire. All

328
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.400
our Idols. I will lay waste that is Judgment language.

329
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.700
now here's one of the Tendencies the modern church has

330
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.300
is we tend to

331
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.500
We tend to sugarcoat.

332
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.600
The Judgment of God and we we rush past it

333
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.400
really fast to get to the mercy to try to soften the

334
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.500
blow.

335
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.400
But remember what Micah was doing here.

336
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.300
He's he's watching.

337
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.400
Looking at these supposed Covenant people of God.

338
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.600
Those who were designed to reflect God's

339
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.300
image and they were out there prostituting themselves.

340
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.500
And Micah's job was not to make people feel

341
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:18.700
better.

342
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.100
Micah's job was not to tell them 10 steps to have

343
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.700
a better life.

344
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.100
His job was not to butter them up and tell them

345
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.300
how great they are and just a firm them and everything. No his job. As

346
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.400
a profit was to communicate hard truths to God's people.

347
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.600
That God is concerned not just with how

348
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.800
the Sinners out there lived their lives.

349
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.200
He's concerned with how his people lived their

350
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:47.500
lives.

351
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.700
probably even more so

352
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.900
than those out there.

353
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.000
And so Micah's message here was that God's people had

354
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.100
turned away from God and they were

355
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.800
worthy deserving of his judgment.

356
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.600
So that was for them, right? We look at this context for them first, but

357
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.600
then the question is what about us?

358
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.400
Like what do we need to understand now as we look at this and

359
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.100
how do we process this? How do we apply it? Because we're not

360
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.900
Israel or Judah. How do we bring this?

361
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.200
2700 years ahead to where we are today.

362
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.500
What do we now to understand now? Well first we clearly

363
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.100
see this.

364
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.200
Remember that sin is consequential.

365
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.000
Right here. You see it sin has consequences.

366
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.400
If God is Holy if God is perfect then

367
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.800
our Rebellion against him will bring Carnage.

368
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.500
Because it's not the way we were designed to live. He designed

369
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.100
us to live according to his plan and his way and if

370
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.500
we don't do that, it's going to bring something bad. It's not

371
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.600
going to go well and here we see sin brings Eternal

372
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.300
destruction if we don't repent and if we don't turn

373
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.300
to him because we're still under that judgment if that's the

374
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:09.400
case.

375
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.300
Sin has consequences eternally,

376
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.200
but not only that.

377
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.300
And we see consequences around us every single day.

378
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.000
Don't we?

379
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.100
We feel it in our bodies. The consequences of sin is includes our

380
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.000
physical death. Like we're we're falling apart physically that's

381
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.400
because of sin, but also there's so many

382
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.800
things we can point to as consequential.

383
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.500
Think of that drunk driver who takes someone else's life,

384
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.100
but they make it through somehow.

385
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.500
Or when you gossip around your kids or around

386
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.600
your coworkers and you're poisoning their heart

387
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.000
towards that person you're talking about.

388
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.600
Someone abuses their spouse and goes to jail for decades

389
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.300
and everybody including the kids are traumatized by

390
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.900
the whole experience.

391
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.400
The adultery that you thought would bring you

392
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.500
happiness satisfaction.

393
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.300
Just bring sorrow and misery and

394
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.000
your family and even in your own life.

395
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.900
unforgiveness

396
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.300
causes your inner life to just implode and it fractures relationships

397
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.200
all over the place.

398
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.300
your pornography addiction

399
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.200
Or even just watching sketchy shows at night, right

400
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.200
you you cut your spouse down at the knees and

401
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.500
then you open the door that your kids might even see something and

402
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.700
find something and you open the door to that.

403
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.100
Like this is what Micah 1:16 says the very last

404
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.800
verse of this chapter. He's talking about them mourning because

405
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.800
of what's happening to their children. That's the realities

406
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.400
that sin has consequences not only in your

407
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.300
life, but also in friends and family around you

408
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.600
even in generations to come after you

409
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.800
See, we don't think about that.

410
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.500
When we're experiencing the temporary pleasures of sin.

411
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.400
We don't think about what's going to come from that but hear

412
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.800
me even hidden sin has affects generationally.

413
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.400
So the next truth fits accordingly here.

414
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.100
Lament is appropriate.

415
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.700
Sin is consequential. Absolutely but lament then is appropriate

416
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.900
for it.

417
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.000
Like we need to remember that lament is appropriate for all the

418
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.700
sin and judgment that we see in our lives and see around us.

419
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.400
That's what Micah's doing when he lists all these funny names

420
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.800
in the back half of chapter one. He's doing exactly this.

421
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.800
I'll explain those in a second, but don't miss how he

422
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800
starts in verse 8.

423
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.700
How he begins this second section here, he says for this what's

424
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.300
he talking this? That's all the Judgment he just talked about.

425
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.400
For this I will lament and wail, I'll go stripped

426
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.900
and naked I'll make lamentation like the jackals and

427
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.000
morning like the ostriches. It's kind of

428
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.100
a weird phrasing there and I don't suggest you go in your

429
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.300
backyard and nakedly scream like a animal you probably

430
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.400
get arrested like don't do that.

431
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.100
But Micah is watching Israel and

432
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.600
Judah destroy themself.

433
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.700
And he could have sat back. He could

434
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.500
have stepped back in judgment himself over

435
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.700
what he was seeing.

436
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500
remember Jonah

437
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.400
with the ninevites. He said he sits back and he

438
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.600
looks self-righteously and judgment over them and he cackling

439
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.400
over their demise and

440
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.400
he's like, yes, here we go. They're gonna get it now and he's doing it.

441
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.100
Michael could have done the same thing, but he didn't right.

442
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.500
Micah felt it with them.

443
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.000
He felt it with them. He he entered

444
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.900
into their suffering. He lamented that

445
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.900
God was planning the Judgment. He was planning.

446
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.600
He saw it. He felt it and he lamented that's

447
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.200
what he's doing in in verses 10 through 15 all these

448
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.300
names he mentions.

449
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.300
That was a list of towns and cities that he could

450
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.300
see from his hometown of Maura chef.

451
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.200
It's like you go on Rural Oklahoma, right? You can see all those tiny

452
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.700
little towns dotting The Horizon especially at night you're

453
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.800
up on a hill you can see stuff. He was looking as

454
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.600
he stood on his rooftop. Maybe he

455
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.200
saw these tiny towns and he was envisioning what

456
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.100
God was about to do.

457
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:53.800
in the area

458
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800
and he lamented

459
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.100
he mourned over the loss and what he did

460
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.200
interestingly. This is kind of a bit of a side note. He used

461
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.200
play on words for all of these names.

462
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.500
He took the names meaning of this this town the meaning

463
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.200
of it and he made a lament or a curse

464
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.200
out of it. If you really go study the language of this you can get

465
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.800
all kinds of it, but I want to give you a couple examples in verse 10. He says

466
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.000
Beth Afra.

467
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.800
That word means House of dust. He

468
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.600
said go roll yourselves in the dust.

469
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.300
For lament right to go more and like that in

470
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.800
verse 11 shaffir that word means beautiful.

471
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.300
He says actually they're going to become the opposite. They're going

472
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.700
to become a town of Shame.

473
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.700
And you go through all of almost all of those names you find how

474
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.400
he plays the word on it, but the point again all

475
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:47.700
of this.

476
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.300
The point of it is bookended by verse 8 and

477
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.800
verse 16 where there's the shaved head morning picture, right?

478
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.600
They're mourning. What's about to come and Exile? He

479
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.300
is lamenting over the Judgment that's

480
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.200
about to come.

481
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.200
So here's the question.

482
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.200
How do you respond?

483
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.600
When you hear about God's judgment

484
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:13.900
coming.

485
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.300
What do you think just rhetorically think

486
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.800
about this? What do you think when you hear that God is a god

487
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.200
of mercy and a god of

488
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.800
wrath.

489
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.100
What crosses your mind first first think about

490
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:31.400
yourself?

491
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.700
Think think about your own.

492
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.600
Sin, do you lament your own

493
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.200
sin?

494
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.200
Like when I got to the age of 20 and finally got

495
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.400
to that point of Brokenness does your sin hurt you?

496
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.300
Do you feel what sangria 7:10 says

497
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.300
do you feel a Godly grief about what

498
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.800
you've done that leads you to repentance?

499
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.500
Listen if you don't

500
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.600
If sin doesn't hurt you.

501
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.200
If you don't feel it inside of you if your heart

502
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.200
is cold, if your heart is hard your heart is

503
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.600
insensitive to the conviction of God's spirit on

504
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.400
you when you sin then you should be concerned.

505
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.500
That's how that's how Judah and Israel God in

506
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.600
this mess and Micah to begin with.

507
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.500
They continue refused the Judgment the

508
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.300
conviction of God, they refused it over and over again until they

509
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.900
finally just got so hard that there was even child sacrifice

510
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.300
happening.

511
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.200
That's how they got the mess. Don't let that happen to you. You need

512
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.400
to wake up. You need to see your head

513
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.800
in the wrong direction and if you don't repent and turn you deserve

514
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.600
judgment, too.

515
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.600
So start checking your heart first about what you feel over

516
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.100
your sin, you know you sin we all do every single

517
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.500
day. So when you don't feel anything about that, that's a problem,

518
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.100
but then there's another heart check here.

519
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.700
When you hear about God's judgment coming on someone else.

520
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.300
How do you respond?

521
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.600
When someone else when on others because they're

522
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.700
sinning God's judgment is coming. Does that cause you

523
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.500
to Lament?

524
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.900
Or do you stand back?

525
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.300
Self-righteously cheering go get them God.

526
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.300
finally

527
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:42.800
go get them.

528
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.500
They deserve it.

529
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.200
Or do you stand back like Micah?

530
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.900
And grieve it.

531
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.200
Now can we be thankful when evil is removed from the world?

532
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.500
Yes.

533
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.300
But we should never celebrate someone's Eternal

534
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.000
destruction.

535
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.500
Should we not instead mourn that they

536
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.000
are headed to an eternity without God in a place

537
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.000
called hell?

538
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.700
Should we not agonize over someone

539
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.600
who who seemingly is walking away from Jesus

540
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.600
with a hardened heart and it seems like they're heading

541
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.200
that way should we not grieve and agonize and lament over

542
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.500
that? Should we not do that in our own heart

543
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.100
over? What's happening is someone else if we don't then I

544
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.700
don't think we care.

545
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.500
Which then is a really bad place for our hearts to be right?

546
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.500
So lament is appropriate.

547
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.400
When we're faced with sin in our own lives, it's

548
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.100
appropriate. But even when faced with sin in

549
00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.900
other people's lives, we should grieve over that.

550
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.600
And it should lead us to action in response, right?

551
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.500
But here's the thing.

552
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.600
Where does all this lead?

553
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.400
Sin, is consequential lament is appropriate where

554
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.500
does this lead? We've seen the nature of God the consequences of

555
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.300
sin and the lament that we need to have.

556
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.600
Okay. Well, what's our final conclusion

557
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.400
that where does this all get us to?

558
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.100
It gets us to the fact that we see clearly Mercy is

559
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.800
needed.

560
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.900
If this is the picture that Micah one paints us.

561
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.100
And we know sin is consequential. We know

562
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.300
that we need to lament it.

563
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.800
We know then also that Mercy is desperately needed.

564
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.000
because again on our own

565
00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.000
we're headed to judgment.

566
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.300
And we have no way out that we can't fix it. So Mercy is

567
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.600
the only answer because that word mercy what it means is that

568
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.900
you don't get what you deserve.

569
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.300
That's the difference Grace is gift right Grace

570
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.100
is you get something you don't deserve.

571
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.400
Mercy

572
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.800
Is you don't get what you do? Absolutely deserve.

573
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.500
You get mercy and that is what our

574
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.300
desperate hope is in is in the

575
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.300
mercy that we believe God truly is what

576
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.300
he says. He is in Exodus 34 Verse 6. He says I'm

577
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.900
a God who is merciful and gracious slow

578
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.400
to anger abounding instead fast. Love

579
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.700
that Hess said love from last week, right and faithful.

580
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.400
I'm abounding in that. I'm overflowing in

581
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.700
that. Yes. He's a god of judgment yet. He's also a

582
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.400
god of Mercy.

583
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.200
This is what we need.

584
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.200
So here's what happens when I start talking about this when

585
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.300
any preacher or any one reads through things like

586
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.200
this and we hear about the Judgment of God people start to think and

587
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.200
we look at this and we think that's not

588
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.500
fair.

589
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.500
judgment, like

590
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.100
I mean, it's a valid question, right? How can a good God?

591
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.300
Bring destruction, how how could he ever do

592
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.200
this as he really good? All those questions start to roll.

593
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.400
It's not fair that God would send someone to hell for

594
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.100
that little thing.

595
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.700
I think it's the wrong question though.

596
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.500
Because what's not fair, it's Mercy.

597
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.000
Right, it doesn't add up.

598
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.500
When you think about it, it is not fair because again what

599
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.400
we deserve is judgment and so we get

600
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.100
what we deserve that's fairness, right? That's that's fair.

601
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.600
but Mercy

602
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.300
means that the judge himself provided away for us

603
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.200
to ascend His Holy Hill forever.

604
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.100
That's not fair. We deserve this and he gave us

605
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.400
something else. He didn't give us what we deserve. That's not

606
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.300
fair.

607
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.600
And here's how he provided that way.

608
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.800
He provided that way because where we turn to Idols Jesus

609
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.600
obeyed it perfectly in our place.

610
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.600
Where we failed and deserved his judgment Jesus

611
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.100
took it for us. He made a

612
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.900
way he made a substitute a replacement so

613
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.900
that we could come to him. It's

614
00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.900
not fair, but Jesus did it for us.

615
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.300
And what he did is he drank that Cup of Wrath to the very

616
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.700
bottom?

617
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.700
And he shed his blood to be the vessel

618
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.400
of reconciliation and restoration

619
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.800
for us that we could be reconciled back

620
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.500
to God where we were once separated. He drew us

621
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.700
back to him. That's the good news of the Gospel friends.

622
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.600
That's why we can rejoice and celebrate even

623
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.500
knowing God's a god of judgment.

624
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.100
But again remember this

625
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.600
Mercy is only as great

626
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.000
as the problem it solves.

627
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.000
You see what I mean?

628
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.000
I've got this $5 debt to my son and and he

629
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.900
says don't worry about it.

630
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.000
Okay.

631
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:29.300
Great.

632
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.400
I move on about my way.

633
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.100
But the greater the problem the greater the debt.

634
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.500
the more glorious Mercy is

635
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.300
And we had an eternal debt that we could not pay.

636
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.100
There was no way for us to fix it.

637
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.200
It's only sweet to us when we

638
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.400
begin to recognize how far from God

639
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.400
that we really were.

640
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.100
And the more that that sinks the depths

641
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.800
and heaviness of our sin the more glorious his

642
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.800
Mercy begins to show up in our hearts.

643
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.500
That's what worship comes from. That's what obedience comes

644
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.200
from. That's what

645
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.600
Proclamation of the Gospel comes from is when we recognize what he

646
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.400
has done for us. This is how great our

647
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.400
God is church. This is how much he loves you

648
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.400
that he would do this unfair thing

649
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.000
and take on the Judgment himself.

650
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.800
And so if you feel far from him right now.

651
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.100
Like if you have a ton of sin in your life, and there's no

652
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.200
way God could love me.

653
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.200
Turn back to him today.

654
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.100
You've seen it. This is his answer to the judgment.

655
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.100
It's Mercy.

656
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.300
And doesn't matter how much?

657
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.700
He's going to be a God who is abundant.

658
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.400
In Mercy overflowing in Mercy. He

659
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.300
is a God who is merciful and gracious slow to

660
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.700
anger abounding instead fast, love and faithfulness.

661
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.700
So if that's where you are today, turn back to him run

662
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.600
back to him. That's how you get healthy again.

663
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.200
That's how you respond when he convicts you in

664
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.500
your heart when you know, you're far from God and you're starting to feel that don't

665
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.700
run away from it run to him and rest in

666
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.400
his Mercy.

667
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.000
As you give him his give him your whole heart rest in

668
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.100
him.

669
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:22.400
He's good.
