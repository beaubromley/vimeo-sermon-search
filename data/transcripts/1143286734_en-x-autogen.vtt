An hour and 35 minutes. That so good. Yeah.

60
00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:59.555
And it was the one, so the start

61
00:07:59.555 --> 00:08:00.915
of the course was a little bit hilly and

62
00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:05.035
It was easy. The last one? Yeah.

63
00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:08.875
Except for there was one incline last,

64
00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:11.595
like stretch was really steep.

65
00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:13.235
I almost felt like it was stretch.

66
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:18.155
No, it did. And Alex was like, come on.

67
00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:20.275
And I was like, I'm coming. Yeah.

68
00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.195
He was

69
00:08:25.575 --> 00:08:29.875
Signed up one year for Oh, I,

70
00:08:30.775 --> 00:08:32.595
but I didn't realize it was a trail.

71
00:08:33.915 --> 00:08:35.195
I got out there, it was January,

72
00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:37.755
it actually home instead a year.

73
00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:38.835
It was like one zero.

74
00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:40.435
I was freezing, but I went in and did it

75
00:08:40.435 --> 00:08:44.275
because I, for money, I get out there

76
00:08:44.335 --> 00:08:46.035
and some army guys showed up

77
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.635
and neighbor were running together.

78
00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:52.635
One, one guy, one of 'em, he took off

79
00:08:52.635 --> 00:08:56.405
and he come back, it snow on ice

80
00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:57.545
And everything.

81
00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:59.525
We had to jump creek and everything.

82
00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:02.085
And that guy got back first.

83
00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:04.765
Well, I got back before a lot of his guys did.

84
00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:08.565
And then, so he went back out to get the rest of 'em

85
00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:10.965
to run back with the, he gets back

86
00:09:10.965 --> 00:09:14.365
and he's got ice cubes on his head, snow on his head,

87
00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:17.285
ice cubes on his ears, like earrings.

88
00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:20.285
I said, what happened? They stick head and in the snow.

89
00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:25.565
What? He said, you know that creek we joke.

90
00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:27.045
He said, my, I slipped

91
00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:28.685
and my head went right in the same, yeah.

92
00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.605
That's terrible. That was cold. I know.

93
00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:39.245
I went further than I, but I got lost market. Well, huh?

94
00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:41.285
Was that No? Yeah, that was out by Lake

95
00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:44.905
And that was fun.

96
00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:47.805
Kind. Same because it's so like slippery,

97
00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:49.805
like they purposely like, you know,

98
00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:51.925
pushed down the trail or rain.

99
00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:55.725
So you're going down really steep.

100
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:57.965
Like there's a slide down one really

101
00:09:58.125 --> 00:09:59.485
sleek, steep part of it.

102
00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:02.085
And then like, you have to wait in line.

103
00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:03.125
So it's not really like a ride.

104
00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:07.445
It's like a little more and then

105
00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:09.645

00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:18.885

No, we're discussing it probably. Yeah.

Well, it won't be for a little while though.

160
00:18:49.455 --> 00:18:52.965
It'll probably happen March-ish time timeframe,

161
00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:57.845

consider and ponder what is good, right and true.

00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:49.565
Uh, and not only to think about it, but to believe it

180
00:20:50.305 --> 00:20:54.005
and, um, to fellowship with one another in that truth.

181
00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:57.605
And Lord, we pray that you continue to open our eyes

182
00:20:57.675 --> 00:20:59.045
that we would see

183
00:20:59.045 --> 00:21:01.005
and behold the wonderful things you have made

184
00:21:01.005 --> 00:21:02.205
known in your word.

185
00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:06.685
Thank you for those that have been with us on this journey

186
00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:09.685
for, uh, whether it's just tonight or every meeting,

187
00:21:09.825 --> 00:21:11.365
or just a few along the way.

188
00:21:11.815 --> 00:21:15.285
Thank you Lord, for the, the truth that we get to explore

189
00:21:15.505 --> 00:21:17.525
and to swim in and, uh,

190
00:21:17.705 --> 00:21:20.485
the way you have taught us as we've gone along.

191
00:21:20.485 --> 00:21:21.845
Lord, we love you. We thank you for that.

192
00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:25.445
And it's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen.

193
00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:30.125
So tonight is really just sort of a recap

194
00:21:30.225 --> 00:21:33.085
and a review of the whole series

195
00:21:33.145 --> 00:21:35.165
of meetings we've had to some extent.

196
00:21:35.705 --> 00:21:38.005
Uh, so what I've labeled this as review

197
00:21:38.705 --> 00:21:41.645
and gospel application, so that's

198
00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:42.685
what we're talking about tonight.

199
00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:46.365
But before we really dive into that, uh, lemme start

200
00:21:46.365 --> 00:21:47.685
with a little housekeeping.

201
00:21:48.465 --> 00:21:50.805
So first off, lemme just say for all

202
00:21:50.805 --> 00:21:54.125
of you guys who've come, uh, one, one time or the whole time

203
00:21:54.665 --> 00:21:56.085
or anywhere between, thank you

204
00:21:56.145 --> 00:21:58.245
for coming and for being a part.

205
00:21:58.245 --> 00:22:00.925
This has been a great class and, uh, we've had a lot

206
00:22:00.925 --> 00:22:03.645
of participation and so just wanna say thanks.

207
00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:06.285
So whether you're a just a church member who's just

208
00:22:06.285 --> 00:22:09.085
attending and not taking it for credit, like some

209
00:22:09.085 --> 00:22:11.845
of the crazy people that are doing it for seminary credit,

210
00:22:12.385 --> 00:22:15.445
uh, you know, you've made this class, uh, what it has been.

211
00:22:15.445 --> 00:22:16.845
And so thank you for being a part of that.

212
00:22:17.665 --> 00:22:22.005
Um, but for those who've been taking the seminary class, uh,

213
00:22:22.005 --> 00:22:24.845
there's been a lot of sweat, blood and tears in that.

214
00:22:25.025 --> 00:22:28.045
And, um, so I just want to commend you guys, thanks

215
00:22:28.105 --> 00:22:30.605
for hanging in there, for working hard on that

216
00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:33.685
and, uh, for contributing to the class overall.

217
00:22:33.945 --> 00:22:35.485
And just a couple of reminders, like

218
00:22:35.485 --> 00:22:37.605
as we have a class like this

219
00:22:37.705 --> 00:22:41.045
and as we work on it at whatever level we're doing,

220
00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:42.605
and whether we just come in

221
00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:44.005
and ponder it throughout the week,

222
00:22:44.345 --> 00:22:47.565
or we're spending hours pouring over books and writing

223
00:22:47.665 --> 00:22:50.885
and all the different, uh, joys that come with assignments.

224
00:22:51.785 --> 00:22:54.685
Um, it, first off, just being involved, it,

225
00:22:54.705 --> 00:22:57.285
it makes a class like this possible.

226
00:22:57.665 --> 00:22:59.085
So I just wanna remind you of that.

227
00:22:59.665 --> 00:23:02.325
Um, also, you know, the way in which

228
00:23:02.885 --> 00:23:06.365
I think we could all probably testify hopefully to the ways

229
00:23:06.435 --> 00:23:08.165
that we personally learn

230
00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:13.205
and grow personally as disciples and followers of Jesus,

231
00:23:14.045 --> 00:23:16.565
whenever we gather together, when we study together

232
00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:18.645
and we reflect on God's word

233
00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:20.285
by the power of the Holy Spirit.

234
00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:23.365
So, uh, just a reminder of some of these truths, you know,

235
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.925
'em, but I wanna remind us anyway, uh,

236
00:23:26.555 --> 00:23:31.045
that these things will encourage our faith, our relationship

237
00:23:31.045 --> 00:23:33.965
with the Lord, our daily walk with God.

238
00:23:34.905 --> 00:23:37.205
And, uh, they help us to obey Jesus

239
00:23:37.385 --> 00:23:41.285
and to follow him better in the world as a disciple

240
00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:42.965
of Christ, as an ambassador

241
00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:45.150
of Jesus Christ into the world, world.

242
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.965
You know, we're not just called to, uh, to believe.

243
00:23:48.265 --> 00:23:49.285
We are called to believe,

244
00:23:49.585 --> 00:23:51.085
but we're not just called to believe.

245
00:23:51.085 --> 00:23:53.605
We're called to actually also take the light

246
00:23:53.605 --> 00:23:56.205
of the gospel out of the world, to represent Christ

247
00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:57.205
to the world around us.

248
00:23:57.425 --> 00:24:00.565
And when we are shaped and formed more

249
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:05.405
and more deeply day by day, whether it's, uh, just in sort

250
00:24:05.405 --> 00:24:09.285
of ethical areas of sort of our, our walk with the Lord

251
00:24:09.305 --> 00:24:10.685
and our own private devotion,

252
00:24:11.185 --> 00:24:13.685
or in the way in which we represent Christ in the,

253
00:24:13.865 --> 00:24:17.245
in the world around us, um, it's strengthened and deepened

254
00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:20.365
and, uh, God's glorified as we are changed

255
00:24:20.905 --> 00:24:22.245
and transformed the Christ.

256
00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:24.205
So anyway, um, we're,

257
00:24:24.205 --> 00:24:27.085
we're not just single solo individuals we've band together.

258
00:24:27.545 --> 00:24:29.525
Uh, we're called to build the kingdom of God.

259
00:24:29.525 --> 00:24:30.965
We're a part of the kingdom of God.

260
00:24:31.305 --> 00:24:32.605
The kingdom of God is Christ

261
00:24:32.985 --> 00:24:34.845
and work in his people into the world.

262
00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:37.485
And just a reminder that it's not inventing

263
00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:41.485
whenever we, uh, give ourselves to these things.

264
00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:43.845
So again, some

265
00:24:43.845 --> 00:24:45.805
of this is reviewed from the first time we met.

266
00:24:46.265 --> 00:24:49.085
Um, the goal of a class like this is not

267
00:24:49.515 --> 00:24:53.205
that we get bigger heads and bigger fuller brains,

268
00:24:53.885 --> 00:24:56.725
although we want to increase what we know, the knowledge

269
00:24:56.725 --> 00:24:58.165
of God, we want to grow it,

270
00:24:58.745 --> 00:25:00.725
but it's ultimately that we would have bigger

271
00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:02.525
and fuller hearts.

272
00:25:03.155 --> 00:25:06.845
It's that our hearts would be enlarged to know and love God,

273
00:25:07.385 --> 00:25:10.925
and that the truths about God would not only warm

274
00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.965
and fire our own heart and soul,

275
00:25:13.425 --> 00:25:17.445
but also, you know, be something that would warm and fire

276
00:25:17.545 --> 00:25:19.685
and stoke the fires of the people around us.

277
00:25:20.305 --> 00:25:22.285
You know, I love the image of the church.

278
00:25:22.845 --> 00:25:24.805
I don't, I didn't come up with this, um,

279
00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:28.325
but the church being like, say a, uh, I mean,

280
00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:30.725
what do you guys use when you're barbecuing?

281
00:25:31.245 --> 00:25:32.805
I use propane, so that doesn't really work.

282
00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:34.765
But if you do charcoal

283
00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:37.965
or even just like logs of wood, you know,

284
00:25:37.965 --> 00:25:40.925
when you have a a pile of fuel that's laying there burning,

285
00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:44.285
if you pull some of it off on its own, it starts

286
00:25:44.305 --> 00:25:46.685
to get cold and go out, right?

287
00:25:47.225 --> 00:25:48.485
But even if it's small

288
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.965
and there's not real hot, you start pulling it all together.

289
00:25:50.985 --> 00:25:52.885
It has a tendency to, to get hotter.

290
00:25:53.345 --> 00:25:55.445
And so that's what, that's why we need each other.

291
00:25:55.705 --> 00:25:58.005
Farmer and I called to just sort of be in isolation,

292
00:25:58.155 --> 00:26:00.365
just believers walking our own journey.

293
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:02.965
Like, we don't need the church. We don't need other people.

294
00:26:03.435 --> 00:26:05.405
It's like a coal wanting to be left alone.

295
00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:07.245
You know, there is some heat there,

296
00:26:07.585 --> 00:26:08.765
but it might not last long.

297
00:26:08.785 --> 00:26:09.805
And so we need each other

298
00:26:10.305 --> 00:26:13.725
and we need to pursue the knowledge of God,

299
00:26:13.725 --> 00:26:17.605
both in intellectually and spiritually experientially.

300
00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:22.405
So anyway, um, when I think about a class like this, it,

301
00:26:22.475 --> 00:26:25.605
it's just one of the ways that we do that.

302
00:26:26.505 --> 00:26:29.365
So, uh, I think I said early on, the the goal is to be

303
00:26:29.745 --> 00:26:30.765
to just informed,

304
00:26:30.765 --> 00:26:35.405
but transform this affects our, our, our ethical decisions.

305
00:26:35.405 --> 00:26:38.285
It affects the way we share the gospel with people

306
00:26:38.755 --> 00:26:39.845
that you encounter.

307
00:26:40.385 --> 00:26:42.405
Uh, the way that we defend the faith,

308
00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:44.405
whenever we're challenged, it,

309
00:26:44.425 --> 00:26:47.125
it affects the way we make disciples, uh,

310
00:26:47.185 --> 00:26:48.485
and we invest in other people

311
00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:53.525
because ultimately, you know, making disciples of Christ is

312
00:26:54.235 --> 00:26:56.685
just that we're passing it along, right?

313
00:26:57.595 --> 00:27:01.205
It's, uh, the call for us, the, the call to be a Christian,

314
00:27:01.905 --> 00:27:05.885
uh, to be a disciple is that we would come to know Christ

315
00:27:06.305 --> 00:27:08.845
and we come to know the triune God

316
00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:10.485
through the Lord Jesus Christ,

317
00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:15.005
and that we would make him known, um, that we would know him

318
00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:17.085
and grow in the knowledge of him.

319
00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:20.245
And in the same way, that's really all that discipleship is,

320
00:27:20.785 --> 00:27:22.605
is helping other people come to know him

321
00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:26.735
and for them to come to grow in that knowledge as well.

322
00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:29.495
So we we're just like beggars that found bread,

323
00:27:29.935 --> 00:27:31.095
Robert's pointed the way,

324
00:27:31.155 --> 00:27:33.695
but the goal is that we're all knowing we're all

325
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:35.375
growing and the Lord together.

326
00:27:35.515 --> 00:27:39.535
So whether it's here at church, like

327
00:27:40.295 --> 00:27:43.775
I I, I don't know what all you guys are involved in, uh,

328
00:27:43.955 --> 00:27:45.455
say the ministries that you have,

329
00:27:45.455 --> 00:27:48.175
whether it's just the individual that you interact

330
00:27:48.175 --> 00:27:50.535
with on sort of a daily or weekly basis,

331
00:27:50.715 --> 00:27:54.175
or maybe serve in the children's ministry or your greeter

332
00:27:54.555 --> 00:27:59.095
or whatever, the way you serve, uh, say just in the context

333
00:27:59.235 --> 00:28:03.095
of our church here, the more that, that you

334
00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:05.095
and I grow in the grace

335
00:28:05.755 --> 00:28:08.495
and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, the more

336
00:28:09.045 --> 00:28:10.535
effectively we're gonna be able to

337
00:28:11.135 --> 00:28:12.255
represent him to other people.

338
00:28:12.635 --> 00:28:14.255
And that's just in the context of our church.

339
00:28:14.565 --> 00:28:16.935
Like, you know, whenever you think back up

340
00:28:16.935 --> 00:28:19.815
and think about, um, the people around you,

341
00:28:19.815 --> 00:28:22.615
whether it's the people you, I mean the, the, the way

342
00:28:22.615 --> 00:28:25.055
that it's said, I don't remember who coined this,

343
00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:29.295
but we, we are disciples in three distinct areas

344
00:28:29.745 --> 00:28:32.255
where we live, work, and play.

345
00:28:32.465 --> 00:28:35.255
Right? It sort of encompasses all of life.

346
00:28:35.635 --> 00:28:38.375
So just think for a second, like, like where you live.

347
00:28:39.185 --> 00:28:42.175
Maybe you live alone, maybe you live with roommates,

348
00:28:42.545 --> 00:28:45.055
maybe you live with a whole very large family.

349
00:28:46.275 --> 00:28:50.415
The gospel and the, and the, and the knowledge of God.

350
00:28:50.635 --> 00:28:55.015
The, the truth of God's word has a lot to say about

351
00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:59.335
where we live and about how we live together as husbands

352
00:28:59.335 --> 00:29:00.855
and wives, as parents

353
00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:05.495
and children, as, uh, roommates, um, as what,

354
00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:06.575
however we relate

355
00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:09.775
and interact with, with the people that we're nearest to.

356
00:29:11.275 --> 00:29:12.575
So we think about where we live.

357
00:29:12.805 --> 00:29:13.895
Also, think about where you work.

358
00:29:14.675 --> 00:29:15.735
You don't, you know, you, you

359
00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:16.895
don't get to choose your family.

360
00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.415
You don't always get to choose who you work with.

361
00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:21.295
Um, you know,

362
00:29:21.315 --> 00:29:22.495
but sometimes you feel like

363
00:29:22.495 --> 00:29:23.535
you don't have much of an option.

364
00:29:23.885 --> 00:29:26.215
Does anybody here ever find it? Okay, let me back up.

365
00:29:26.555 --> 00:29:28.015
Do you ever find it challenging

366
00:29:28.115 --> 00:29:30.455
to live in a house with people?

367
00:29:33.405 --> 00:29:34.415
Okay, no lying.

368
00:29:35.675 --> 00:29:38.295
Um, do you ever find if you live alone,

369
00:29:38.315 --> 00:29:39.695
do you ever find that challenging?

370
00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:41.765
No. Okay. That's challenging.

371
00:29:42.465 --> 00:29:45.485
Um, if you, if you ever work

372
00:29:45.515 --> 00:29:49.485
with people like you work in an office, do you ever find

373
00:29:49.485 --> 00:29:50.605
that hard to deal with?

374
00:29:54.485 --> 00:29:55.815
Okay, so where we live work

375
00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:59.335
or we live, work where we play, that's just sort

376
00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:03.855
of a cheap word that means what you do for fun

377
00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:06.255
or when you're not living at home

378
00:30:06.355 --> 00:30:08.655
or you're not, uh, working.

379
00:30:09.755 --> 00:30:12.175
And so just the reality, kind of the idea,

380
00:30:12.175 --> 00:30:14.535
the reason I like those three categories

381
00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:16.695
is represents sort of all of life.

382
00:30:16.695 --> 00:30:18.655
There's different ways you could slice that up,

383
00:30:18.715 --> 00:30:22.135
but that, that when we think about these truths

384
00:30:22.155 --> 00:30:25.215
and when we walk in obedience to the word of God,

385
00:30:25.275 --> 00:30:27.095
we walk in light of the word of God.

386
00:30:27.835 --> 00:30:29.495
It, it should and it does,

387
00:30:29.555 --> 00:30:32.415
and it can affect our whole lives.

388
00:30:32.475 --> 00:30:34.375
And I just want to, that's why I just want

389
00:30:34.375 --> 00:30:37.095
to belabor the point, and maybe some of this is obvious,

390
00:30:37.915 --> 00:30:40.975
but it's that, like, when I'm thinking through how

391
00:30:40.975 --> 00:30:42.735
to create a class like this

392
00:30:42.755 --> 00:30:44.655
and where I was putting together the outline

393
00:30:44.655 --> 00:30:48.935
and all of that, it's that I, I want us to go deep and wide

394
00:30:49.475 --> 00:30:50.815
and to really learn a lot

395
00:30:51.315 --> 00:30:53.335
and to thank God's thoughts after him.

396
00:30:53.395 --> 00:30:56.375
But I also want to be sure we reel in

397
00:30:57.035 --> 00:30:59.375
and we recognize we're not just sort of brains walking

398
00:30:59.375 --> 00:31:01.295
around, but we're, we're whole people.

399
00:31:02.075 --> 00:31:05.255
And the word of God has a lot to say to our whole lives.

400
00:31:06.035 --> 00:31:09.375
And, um, and at the end of the day, you know, in the book

401
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.975
of James, he would say, it's not just that we want

402
00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:15.175
to be hearers of the word, but doers also.

403
00:31:15.395 --> 00:31:17.775
So it's just really important that when we think

404
00:31:18.505 --> 00:31:21.935
great thoughts about God, which we should, we should think

405
00:31:22.565 --> 00:31:25.215
more about the great thoughts about God than we do,

406
00:31:25.795 --> 00:31:27.375
but we ought to labor

407
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:30.455
and be careful to couple that also with,

408
00:31:30.915 --> 00:31:33.295
in having a major influence on our lives.

409
00:31:33.395 --> 00:31:35.415
So I just wanna invite us into that again.

410
00:31:35.955 --> 00:31:40.135
Um, and as we wrap up this semester, so, um,

411
00:31:41.315 --> 00:31:43.575
at, at the end of the day, what we're really talking about

412
00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:47.375
is there's, there's two things in the Bible

413
00:31:47.435 --> 00:31:51.935
and God's word that are really overarching banners over

414
00:31:51.935 --> 00:31:54.255
everything we believe and do.

415
00:31:54.965 --> 00:31:56.255
It's the great commandment

416
00:31:56.715 --> 00:32:00.615
and the great commission, uh, who can summarize

417
00:32:00.715 --> 00:32:02.215
for me the creator just state

418
00:32:02.915 --> 00:32:04.975
the great commandment when Jesus

419
00:32:04.975 --> 00:32:06.055
said, this is the greatest commandment.

420
00:32:06.055 --> 00:32:08.015
What, what is it? Love the Lord your God

421
00:32:08.015 --> 00:32:09.255
with all your heart, soul.

422
00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:13.295
Okay, yeah. You got it's love.

423
00:32:13.295 --> 00:32:15.055
God love others is the second.

424
00:32:15.605 --> 00:32:18.015
Okay, well, that's the second. Yes. Right? Yeah.

425
00:32:18.115 --> 00:32:19.895
So, and often we kinda lump those together

426
00:32:19.955 --> 00:32:21.255
and I think rightly so.

427
00:32:21.835 --> 00:32:23.015
Um, so,

428
00:32:23.395 --> 00:32:26.215
but Jesus said the greatest man was this, that you love God

429
00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:30.255
with all your heart, soul, mind and strength,

430
00:32:30.275 --> 00:32:32.615
or whatever your English translation says.

431
00:32:33.155 --> 00:32:36.295
Um, and so the point is all of you, right?

432
00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:39.605
And so that you love God, uh, sometimes we say, well,

433
00:32:39.605 --> 00:32:40.725
I I love God with my heart.

434
00:32:41.035 --> 00:32:42.405
What we're trying to do here is love God

435
00:32:42.405 --> 00:32:43.925
with our minds, you know?

436
00:32:44.025 --> 00:32:47.085
And so, but at the end of the day, um, it's not,

437
00:32:47.115 --> 00:32:48.365
it's not just that.

438
00:32:48.365 --> 00:32:51.405
What, what, well, one of the ways that we get to live

439
00:32:51.405 --> 00:32:55.045
that out is with what you said of the second commandment.

440
00:32:55.455 --> 00:32:58.285
Jesus. They weren't, he, they weren't asking him

441
00:32:58.915 --> 00:33:01.005
what the second greatest commandment they were asking about

442
00:33:01.005 --> 00:33:02.525
the first, but he volunteered it

443
00:33:02.675 --> 00:33:05.845
because I think he rightly understands the way we're wired

444
00:33:06.025 --> 00:33:09.205
and the way we are, which is sometimes it's easy to say,

445
00:33:09.595 --> 00:33:12.845
well, the Bible says, um, how can you say I love God,

446
00:33:13.025 --> 00:33:16.645
who I can't see when you hate your neighbor,

447
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:17.845
who you can see.

448
00:33:18.305 --> 00:33:20.605
And so there's sort of a challenge of practicality.

449
00:33:21.025 --> 00:33:24.405
We have this, uh, vertical relationship to the Lord.

450
00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:26.845
And then a lot of the times, the way

451
00:33:26.845 --> 00:33:28.365
that plays out in the world is

452
00:33:28.565 --> 00:33:30.285
horizontally with the people around us.

453
00:33:30.705 --> 00:33:31.965
And so there's just that challenge

454
00:33:32.105 --> 00:33:34.085
to not only be here is the doers of the work.

455
00:33:34.505 --> 00:33:35.245
So that's the great

456
00:33:35.245 --> 00:33:36.645
commandment to love God with all our heart.

457
00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:39.365
So mind and strength, the great commission is what

458
00:33:43.585 --> 00:33:44.485
The nation Okay.

459
00:33:44.485 --> 00:33:46.645
That's right. Going all the world.

460
00:33:47.265 --> 00:33:48.605
Uh, well, and it begins with,

461
00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:50.805
Christ has all authority, right?

462
00:33:51.465 --> 00:33:53.125
All a authorities given in heaven

463
00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:55.205
and on earth's, really nowhere else.

464
00:33:55.715 --> 00:33:58.245
Okay? That's about it. Right? Heaven and earth.

465
00:33:59.185 --> 00:34:01.325
And then he just said he commissions his people

466
00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:03.845
to go into the world and to make disciples.

467
00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:06.645
And, uh, that's helped him come to know and to come to grow.

468
00:34:06.645 --> 00:34:09.565
What, what's that? So even they know fathers have

469
00:34:09.625 --> 00:34:10.925
to Absolutely.

470
00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:13.605
Yeah, that's right. In the name of the Tri God.

471
00:34:14.505 --> 00:34:17.245
So to evangelize them, to baptize them

472
00:34:17.865 --> 00:34:21.725
and to teach them, to teach them what all

473
00:34:21.725 --> 00:34:23.845
that they've learned, to observe, all that they've learned,

474
00:34:24.505 --> 00:34:26.645
all, all that, who's learned all

475
00:34:26.645 --> 00:34:27.925
that Christ commanded, okay?

476
00:34:29.665 --> 00:34:31.325
All that Christ commanded. Yeah.

477
00:34:31.345 --> 00:34:34.645
So the disciples, what they had learned from him, uh,

478
00:34:35.155 --> 00:34:36.525
that they would teach those things

479
00:34:36.665 --> 00:34:39.205
and teach them to obey them, right?

480
00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:42.245
And so disciple the nations in the knowledge of God.

481
00:34:42.265 --> 00:34:47.245
So anyway, um, I just wanna remind you, as we sort of begin

482
00:34:47.245 --> 00:34:49.405
to land the plane on this, I just want

483
00:34:49.405 --> 00:34:52.605
to emphasize these things again, sort of the practical side

484
00:34:52.605 --> 00:34:54.765
of it, that it's important that we, uh,

485
00:34:54.945 --> 00:34:56.245
we do more than just think about it,

486
00:34:56.705 --> 00:34:59.925
but we be challenged at a heart level to really, uh,

487
00:34:59.945 --> 00:35:01.525
be influenced by in our lives.

488
00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:05.085
Um, so anyway, that was a long way of saying thanks

489
00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:06.325
for being a part of this class.

490
00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:08.805
That's where we are actually.

491
00:35:09.185 --> 00:35:11.245
Hey, uh, I've got slides for this. Look at that. Thanks.

492
00:35:13.505 --> 00:35:16.445
Hey, I'm not dumb. Actually, I wanted the next, I wanted

493
00:35:16.445 --> 00:35:19.205
to say thank you to our elders who've taught the

494
00:35:19.205 --> 00:35:20.845
classes that you guys have taught.

495
00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:24.125
And, uh, thank you

496
00:35:25.945 --> 00:35:29.285
so not, not only for teaching the classes,

497
00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:32.645
but al also just learning alongside us

498
00:35:32.665 --> 00:35:33.805
as students of the word.

499
00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:35.565
And, uh, you guys are a model of

500
00:35:35.565 --> 00:35:36.605
that, and we appreciate that.

501
00:35:37.265 --> 00:35:39.405
And, uh, so we're grateful for that.

502
00:35:40.145 --> 00:35:42.845
Um, and then last but not least, I, I could say a lot more,

503
00:35:42.865 --> 00:35:45.485
but I really wanna say thank you to David Barnes.

504
00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:47.245
Because David Barnes.

505
00:35:47.955 --> 00:35:52.365
Yeah, because

506
00:35:52.365 --> 00:35:54.565
David Barnes is not only a very diligent student.

507
00:35:55.025 --> 00:35:57.845
He has balanced enthusiasm for this, these classes

508
00:35:58.585 --> 00:36:01.805
and, uh, the times whenever I'm dragging or behind,

509
00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:03.925
and he comes in and prods me along.

510
00:36:03.925 --> 00:36:05.565
Really appreciate that. Uh,

511
00:36:05.655 --> 00:36:07.565
David does a ton behind the scenes.

512
00:36:07.585 --> 00:36:09.605
He does a lot of prompt, like he organizes

513
00:36:09.605 --> 00:36:11.525
and manages all the paperwork and,

514
00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:13.965
and some of the logistics of Thank you,

515
00:36:13.965 --> 00:36:15.325
David, for what you do.

516
00:36:15.875 --> 00:36:18.685
Yeah. Uh, okay.

517
00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:22.725
So where are we?

518
00:36:23.385 --> 00:36:24.445
Ah, next.

519
00:36:24.555 --> 00:36:28.365
Okay, so, so next semester, this is just kind of a,

520
00:36:29.045 --> 00:36:30.605
a blurb for next semester.

521
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.125
There will be other classes going on.

522
00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:34.245
Uh, the elders are teaching a class.

523
00:36:34.505 --> 00:36:38.525
Remind me the name of it. It's Bible, uh, acronym.

524
00:36:39.345 --> 00:36:42.245
It is an acronym, but in short, it's a walk

525
00:36:42.245 --> 00:36:44.565
through the Bible, like an intro to the Bible for people

526
00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:45.845
to need a refresher or

527
00:36:46.385 --> 00:36:48.285
For the first time What's in the Bible?

528
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:49.445
How's the storyline?

529
00:36:49.555 --> 00:36:52.325
Storyline of the Bible? Yeah. So there's that.

530
00:36:52.325 --> 00:36:53.685
There will be, I think a couple of others.

531
00:36:54.425 --> 00:36:57.765
But what we will be doing is, again, five major topics.

532
00:36:58.465 --> 00:37:01.245
Um, Christology, pneumatology, soteriology,

533
00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:03.485
ecclesiology, and eschatology.

534
00:37:04.225 --> 00:37:07.085
And, um, the way I sort of broke it up is there's,

535
00:37:07.085 --> 00:37:09.085
part one is the first three topics,

536
00:37:09.895 --> 00:37:11.485
we'll have a three week break.

537
00:37:11.845 --> 00:37:13.645
Everyone will have a three week break for,

538
00:37:14.395 --> 00:37:15.805
what is it like worship night,

539
00:37:15.825 --> 00:37:18.765
or there's, uh, a prayer meeting to spring break.

540
00:37:18.765 --> 00:37:20.165
There's several things all in a row.

541
00:37:20.785 --> 00:37:23.165
And, um, and then the part two.

542
00:37:23.265 --> 00:37:25.325
So if you kind of needed to break it up

543
00:37:25.325 --> 00:37:27.485
and you want bounce between classes, you can do that.

544
00:37:28.025 --> 00:37:30.565
Uh, not if you're in for credit, that's not an option.

545
00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:33.405
But, um, anyway, just to, so, you know, that's sort

546
00:37:33.405 --> 00:37:35.165
of what's, uh, what's coming.

547
00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:39.765
So, uh, because, you know, there is sort of a rhyme

548
00:37:39.765 --> 00:37:42.685
and a reason to the, the way we've kind

549
00:37:42.685 --> 00:37:46.505
of studied these things as, you know, what we,

550
00:37:46.505 --> 00:37:50.465
what we landed on the, the chapter in our textbook

551
00:37:50.465 --> 00:37:53.025
that we're bended on was the doctrine of sin.

552
00:37:53.725 --> 00:37:55.705
And, um, and you know, if you're paying attention,

553
00:37:55.765 --> 00:37:58.145
you can be tempted to be like, man, I sort of hate

554
00:37:58.145 --> 00:37:59.585
to end there, you know?

555
00:38:00.125 --> 00:38:02.745
But, uh, but good news, there's good news coming, right?

556
00:38:03.445 --> 00:38:06.185
The first thing we're gonna study right out the gate is

557
00:38:06.185 --> 00:38:07.225
the Doctrine of Christ.

558
00:38:07.365 --> 00:38:10.665
And just like in this semester, we spent a ton of time

559
00:38:11.405 --> 00:38:12.865
on the doctrine of God

560
00:38:12.925 --> 00:38:15.105
and the knowledge of, of God, who he is

561
00:38:15.105 --> 00:38:16.625
and what he's like and what he's done.

562
00:38:17.165 --> 00:38:18.785
Um, in the same way we're gonna spend a lot

563
00:38:18.785 --> 00:38:20.905
of time on the doctrine of Christ.

564
00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.665
And that'll be sort of the major feature there.

565
00:38:24.685 --> 00:38:26.305
And let's see here.

566
00:38:27.015 --> 00:38:30.585
Alright, so

567
00:38:32.075 --> 00:38:35.025
we've covered, we've covered a lot of ground as we've been

568
00:38:35.085 --> 00:38:36.685
through all of these subjects.

569
00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:40.765
So let, lemme just ask you this it, for

570
00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:42.645
however many classes you've been a part of

571
00:38:42.745 --> 00:38:45.645
or how involved in it you've been, tell me what,

572
00:38:45.645 --> 00:38:47.845
what are some of the, I know I've named a few,

573
00:38:47.865 --> 00:38:49.485
but what are some of the topics

574
00:38:49.595 --> 00:38:51.925
that we've been talking about in this class?

575
00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:56.965
It come to mind for you,

576
00:38:57.915 --> 00:38:58.915
Trinity.

577
00:38:59.435 --> 00:39:02.565
Okay. Trinity Attributes to God.

578
00:39:03.065 --> 00:39:06.365
What's that? Attributes. Okay. God's attributes.

579
00:39:08.835 --> 00:39:11.485
Okay. It's communicable and incommunicable.

580
00:39:14.905 --> 00:39:16.965
The doctrines of man and Christ.

581
00:39:17.795 --> 00:39:21.725
Okay. Of, uh, when you say of Christ,

582
00:39:23.115 --> 00:39:25.205
what, uh, what way in particular have we

583
00:39:25.205 --> 00:39:26.245
looked down? The persons

584
00:39:26.245 --> 00:39:27.245
Of Christ?

585
00:39:27.275 --> 00:39:30.045
Okay. Yeah. Especially, uh, in relation to,

586
00:39:30.225 --> 00:39:31.405
um, the Trinity.

587
00:39:32.035 --> 00:39:33.565
Yeah, that's right. Atonement

588
00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:34.725
At, Yep.

589
00:39:40.905 --> 00:39:41.445
What's that?

590
00:39:42.445 --> 00:39:47.245
C Sim. Yeah, yeah. Right. Okay.

591
00:39:47.245 --> 00:39:48.605
That's right. Yeah. We all, okay.

592
00:39:48.605 --> 00:39:50.405
What was the, do y'all remember the first one?

593
00:39:50.405 --> 00:39:51.805
We studied the first

594
00:39:52.205 --> 00:39:55.685
doctrine. Helen taught on it.

595
00:39:56.545 --> 00:39:57.685
That's why don't remember.

596
00:39:59.375 --> 00:40:03.445
Sorry, Alan. I remember. And only part of it got recorded.

597
00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:06.885
Um, that was when I was running the technology.

598
00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:11.845
Um, so it was the doctrine of the word of God,

599
00:40:13.065 --> 00:40:16.765
and, um, so foundational to, to all the other things.

600
00:40:17.045 --> 00:40:18.645
'cause that's how we know them. We're talking about

601
00:40:18.645 --> 00:40:21.365
revelation, general revelation, the sun of the moon,

602
00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:23.125
the stars, the amoebas.

603
00:40:23.125 --> 00:40:25.845
They, they tell us there's a creator these wise

604
00:40:25.905 --> 00:40:27.205
and infinite and creative.

605
00:40:27.865 --> 00:40:31.565
Um, but the word of God, what we call special revelation, is

606
00:40:31.565 --> 00:40:32.765
what teaches us,

607
00:40:32.765 --> 00:40:35.085
particularly the things we're talking about.

608
00:40:35.155 --> 00:40:36.845
It's like you wouldn't know

609
00:40:37.675 --> 00:40:40.205
something about the incommunicable attributes

610
00:40:40.205 --> 00:40:42.165
of God if he hadn't told us.

611
00:40:42.655 --> 00:40:46.045
Right? And so the word of God is so foundational to that.

612
00:40:46.465 --> 00:40:50.205
So, um, doctrine of man, doctrine of God sin.

613
00:40:50.825 --> 00:40:54.405
Um, so, we'll, we'll do a little more of this

614
00:40:54.505 --> 00:40:57.565
as we roll along, but what are, uh, let me ask you this way,

615
00:40:59.115 --> 00:41:00.565
what about any

616
00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.445
or all of that has been something for you

617
00:41:03.635 --> 00:41:06.445
that has either been new

618
00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:12.045
or newly compelling, like something that is either like,

619
00:41:12.065 --> 00:41:13.885
man, I haven't really ever thought about that,

620
00:41:14.865 --> 00:41:19.245
or something that has been sort of eye-opening

621
00:41:19.705 --> 00:41:21.765
for you that you'd be willing to share

622
00:41:27.945 --> 00:41:28.765
If there's anything

623
00:41:31.685 --> 00:41:34.565
I did not really Understand and still don't,

624
00:41:34.745 --> 00:41:39.685
but maybe just a ble pull more of the Holy Spirit,

625
00:41:39.945 --> 00:41:42.325
who he really is and yeah.

626
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:46.885
And how that all fits together within the three.

627
00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:49.805
And, um, and going through that book

628
00:41:50.545 --> 00:41:54.645
to writing in the Trinity was, was a delight and,

629
00:41:54.665 --> 00:41:56.165
and pretty eyeopening

630
00:41:57.345 --> 00:42:00.805
and changed my whole view of,

631
00:42:02.115 --> 00:42:05.245
well, he's not that weird anymore.

632
00:42:06.185 --> 00:42:08.645
Uh, he is not that mysterious. He is not.

633
00:42:11.005 --> 00:42:14.245
I think it somehow get my arms a little bit.

634
00:42:14.995 --> 00:42:18.445
Yeah. That's great. Yeah, that's a book.

635
00:42:18.565 --> 00:42:20.525
I don't remember if we talked about it in here,

636
00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:24.845
but, um, we talked about that one, the Delighting

637
00:42:24.845 --> 00:42:28.205
and the Trinity, uh, by Michael Reeves.

638
00:42:29.665 --> 00:42:32.485
Um, yeah, if you've never read that

639
00:42:32.705 --> 00:42:34.725
or you feel like the Trinity's kind of weird,

640
00:42:35.105 --> 00:42:36.845
but Dan did a great job teaching on that.

641
00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:39.605
Even the, the math you drew out here is super helpful.

642
00:42:40.145 --> 00:42:42.365
Um, but that book actually, so if you can imagine

643
00:42:43.565 --> 00:42:47.645
a book about the Trinity that's fun to read and,

644
00:42:48.025 --> 00:42:49.845
and enjoyable and, and good

645
00:42:49.945 --> 00:42:52.045
and accessible, I mean, then you can read, you know,

646
00:42:52.045 --> 00:42:54.085
a thousand page volumes on it.

647
00:42:54.265 --> 00:42:56.805
And this is maybe, I don't know, 150, 200 pages,

648
00:42:57.145 --> 00:42:58.645
and it's really, really helpful.

649
00:42:59.075 --> 00:43:01.405
What, 120. Okay. That's great.

650
00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:04.365
So, uh, plug for plug for that book. Yeah.

651
00:43:04.425 --> 00:43:08.485
So The Trinity, right, uh, notoriously challenging subject,

652
00:43:08.665 --> 00:43:10.925
but, um, yeah, exploring it is, um,

653
00:43:11.425 --> 00:43:14.165
is really encouraging I think as we've done.

654
00:43:14.195 --> 00:43:15.195
What else

655
00:43:17.225 --> 00:43:18.225
Did Aaron do? Uh,

656
00:43:18.225 --> 00:43:21.325
doctrine, Providence, or, yes. Yeah, yeah.

657
00:43:21.355 --> 00:43:24.885
That really stuck with me pretty well, that, you know,

658
00:43:24.925 --> 00:43:27.685
I know that he's sovereign and he's, he, he goes before us,

659
00:43:27.745 --> 00:43:30.645
but just the level to which he's involved

660
00:43:30.825 --> 00:43:33.045
and the, the, uh,

661
00:43:34.785 --> 00:43:37.845
Uh, I don't know the, not the influence,

662
00:43:37.945 --> 00:43:40.805
but the, uh, pervasiveness of his involvement,

663
00:43:40.805 --> 00:43:45.205
how much he loves us, uh, as his, as his, you know, uh,

664
00:43:46.085 --> 00:43:50.005
greatest creation, uh, is just so,

665
00:43:51.025 --> 00:43:53.765
Uh, So broad

666
00:43:53.825 --> 00:43:57.525
and so, uh, unbelievably, uh,

667
00:43:59.115 --> 00:44:03.805
just overwhelming to me how, how much he's

668
00:44:04.365 --> 00:44:06.045
involved in every aspect, if, if we,

669
00:44:06.105 --> 00:44:07.525
if we really wanna see it that way.

670
00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.485
Uh, sometimes we just kind of get caught up in our lives

671
00:44:10.625 --> 00:44:12.285
and day to day stuff, but,

672
00:44:12.865 --> 00:44:15.365
and then really start looking for that, that,

673
00:44:15.365 --> 00:44:17.645
that problem, you know?

674
00:44:18.225 --> 00:44:19.365
So, yeah. That's

675
00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:20.365
Great. Uh, Aaron

676
00:44:20.365 --> 00:44:22.005
did a good job getting me

677
00:44:22.005 --> 00:44:23.045
to really think about that.

678
00:44:23.405 --> 00:44:24.405
I like that.

679
00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:26.605
No, that's great.

680
00:44:31.005 --> 00:44:32.205
I just was

681
00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:36.445
before creation.

682
00:44:36.835 --> 00:44:37.835
Yeah.

683
00:44:41.765 --> 00:44:45.525
I would give another plug for the, um,

684
00:44:46.105 --> 00:44:47.285
was very impactful for me.

685
00:44:48.105 --> 00:44:52.285
And probably the most impactful part was just the discussion

686
00:44:52.855 --> 00:44:57.125
about, uh, you know, that often people say

687
00:44:57.125 --> 00:45:01.325
that God is loved with the necessity of the Trinity,

688
00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:05.285
and that God is

689
00:45:07.505 --> 00:45:10.685
God one person love could not exist.

690
00:45:12.075 --> 00:45:16.365
Explanation, necessity, that love,

691
00:45:16.945 --> 00:45:19.005
but then the Trinity is an overflow

692
00:45:19.315 --> 00:45:21.205
between, so that is why God.

693
00:45:27.355 --> 00:45:32.205
Yeah. That's great. He has been that way since forever.

694
00:45:32.575 --> 00:45:35.605
Right? Yeah. That's good.

695
00:45:37.645 --> 00:45:40.605
I know the, the phrase that has rung in my head

696
00:45:41.655 --> 00:45:45.045
since I heard Dan say it, uh, was the truth.

697
00:45:45.165 --> 00:45:48.325
I know, but I loved when you said God is everywhere

698
00:45:49.185 --> 00:45:50.645
and God is every win.

699
00:45:51.825 --> 00:45:55.965
And, uh, something, I know that's something I've, uh, tried

700
00:45:55.965 --> 00:45:58.925
to teach at times, but it just kind of hid me and knew

701
00:45:59.545 --> 00:46:02.685
and was so encouraging as the more I thought about,

702
00:46:03.385 --> 00:46:04.885
um, God is every win.

703
00:46:04.885 --> 00:46:08.005
Frankly, I've used it in pastoral conversations.

704
00:46:08.115 --> 00:46:10.725
I've used it, you know, in a, in a number of contexts.

705
00:46:10.725 --> 00:46:12.445
Just that phrase is just

706
00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:17.465
so, what

707
00:46:18.835 --> 00:46:23.165
What The role of man and woman,

708
00:46:25.025 --> 00:46:26.405
Man and woman, yes. The

709
00:46:26.405 --> 00:46:27.405
Role of man and woman.

710
00:46:27.705 --> 00:46:30.845
So, uh, their job was maintaining a garden

711
00:46:31.585 --> 00:46:35.285
and man was, uh, represent, uh, the human research

712
00:46:35.785 --> 00:46:38.605
and, uh, a named the, and

713
00:46:38.605 --> 00:46:42.005
after their told, uh, their still the same,

714
00:46:42.265 --> 00:46:45.725
but got increase, uh, the labor for men

715
00:46:45.725 --> 00:46:48.045
and increase the pain, uh, for women.

716
00:46:51.555 --> 00:46:54.365
Yeah. We see that in the world around us, for sure.

717
00:47:03.245 --> 00:47:07.325
Anything else? How about this, uh, was,

718
00:47:07.425 --> 00:47:09.245
has there been anything that was

719
00:47:10.205 --> 00:47:11.445
uniquely challenging to you?

720
00:47:12.395 --> 00:47:16.485
Like either it was hard, like it's a truth that

721
00:47:17.495 --> 00:47:19.925
maybe, I mean, I know you wouldn't wanna say it this way.

722
00:47:20.455 --> 00:47:22.685
Maybe there's like a truth you've encountered you don't

723
00:47:22.685 --> 00:47:27.405
like, or something that kind of hurts

724
00:47:28.235 --> 00:47:30.965
because you feel a struggle with that.

725
00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:35.165
You know, either it's hard for you to believe it, uh,

726
00:47:36.425 --> 00:47:39.085
or you try to square it with your, your experience.

727
00:47:39.965 --> 00:47:42.365
Anything you'd wanna, that could be real personal.

728
00:47:42.365 --> 00:47:44.525
So I'm not, but if there's anything you'd wanna share,

729
00:47:48.995 --> 00:47:53.445
Mark, I'd say if we're, if we're, if we're gonna be honest

730
00:47:53.505 --> 00:47:58.445
and transparent here, um, for me, I, I'm grateful

731
00:47:58.445 --> 00:48:01.525
that Steve taught on prayer and not me,

732
00:48:02.755 --> 00:48:07.325
because I, I really didn't think there's so many people

733
00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:09.525
who are better at that than I'm, yeah.

734
00:48:09.825 --> 00:48:13.365
And when you start thinking about, you know,

735
00:48:13.415 --> 00:48:15.045
practicing much screech right?

736
00:48:16.305 --> 00:48:20.285
And walking the dog, it's, to me,

737
00:48:20.405 --> 00:48:23.045
I find it easier lots of times to teach on the Trinity,

738
00:48:23.115 --> 00:48:24.485
then teach on prayer.

739
00:48:26.265 --> 00:48:28.645
And I was grateful for you for sharing that

740
00:48:28.675 --> 00:48:29.885
with the rest of us.

741
00:48:30.305 --> 00:48:34.125
And To me, I think that is probably one

742
00:48:34.125 --> 00:48:35.365
of the more impactful ones.

743
00:48:36.865 --> 00:48:40.645
So it's not some, not something that I, I think, um,

744
00:48:41.915 --> 00:48:44.045
hard to believe because I believe it, it's hard

745
00:48:44.045 --> 00:48:45.045
To do. Right.

746
00:48:45.045 --> 00:48:48.925
Alright. Does that make sense? Yeah, for sure.

747
00:48:50.865 --> 00:48:52.405
No, thanks for sharing that. That's great.

748
00:48:53.355 --> 00:48:57.205
Anybody else relate to that? Yeah, sure.

749
00:48:57.255 --> 00:49:00.325
There was some conversation regarding John time

750
00:49:00.465 --> 00:49:03.285
and eternity that was

751
00:49:04.365 --> 00:49:07.125
puzzling an insight towards, okay.

752
00:49:08.985 --> 00:49:13.165
Any way you'd want to elaborate to, well, the god's outside

753
00:49:13.165 --> 00:49:18.045
of pride, Northern eternity concept.

754
00:49:18.795 --> 00:49:22.005
Yeah. Sort of. Yeah.

755
00:49:23.395 --> 00:49:24.085
Well, that's good.

756
00:49:28.805 --> 00:49:32.445
Anything else? Thinking or doing? Living

757
00:49:33.625 --> 00:49:35.845
The, the, the struggle and the back

758
00:49:35.845 --> 00:49:40.805
and forth, uh, tug of war of God's heart

759
00:49:40.825 --> 00:49:42.325
for us, for all of eternity

760
00:49:43.305 --> 00:49:47.005
and our will that he's given us to choose.

761
00:49:48.145 --> 00:49:51.205
And of course, his providence nature of, he's, he's at work

762
00:49:51.345 --> 00:49:54.085
and he's sovereign and he can intervene, he chooses,

763
00:49:54.665 --> 00:49:55.965
but that he loves us so much.

764
00:49:55.965 --> 00:50:00.685
He gives us that, that freedom, uh, that mystery there

765
00:50:00.945 --> 00:50:04.005
of, you know, being chosen, being loved,

766
00:50:04.425 --> 00:50:08.725
and yet the ability to choose to go in another direction,

767
00:50:09.385 --> 00:50:10.925
sin and do wrong.

768
00:50:10.925 --> 00:50:13.805
It's that, that struggle that's, uh, that mystery of God.

769
00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:14.865
And,

770
00:50:15.425 --> 00:50:19.445
Uh, It's, uh, very challenging at times.

771
00:50:19.835 --> 00:50:22.325
Yeah. About the whole picture of

772
00:50:22.325 --> 00:50:24.005
that struggle with mankind.

773
00:50:24.395 --> 00:50:28.805
Yeah. Um, anything else?

774
00:50:31.225 --> 00:50:32.225
We have time.

775
00:50:35.525 --> 00:50:37.645
I think those are the part, when we talked about the

776
00:50:37.645 --> 00:50:40.805
providence of God, we didn't elaborate on this,

777
00:50:40.825 --> 00:50:45.405
but it talked about free will versus, um, election.

778
00:50:45.985 --> 00:50:49.405
And I think I really, I'm struggling to wrap my mind around

779
00:50:49.405 --> 00:50:51.325
that, but it was, it was a,

780
00:50:53.625 --> 00:50:56.645
How those two intersect, How they can live.

781
00:50:57.555 --> 00:50:59.685
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

782
00:50:59.685 --> 00:51:00.765
I think early on, um,

783
00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:03.685
we talked about there's mystery in the Bible

784
00:51:04.425 --> 00:51:08.165
and, uh, not contradiction,

785
00:51:08.745 --> 00:51:11.165
but two, two things that are, it's not

786
00:51:11.165 --> 00:51:13.205
that two opposing things can be true at the same time.

787
00:51:13.235 --> 00:51:17.325
Like, I can't be walking with the dog when I'm not, but,

788
00:51:17.705 --> 00:51:19.565
but it is true that, um,

789
00:51:20.585 --> 00:51:22.725
one thing can be true about God here.

790
00:51:23.505 --> 00:51:25.085
And another thing true, I got here,

791
00:51:25.465 --> 00:51:27.165
and I don't quite know how to put that together.

792
00:51:28.075 --> 00:51:30.045
Like, I like the analogy of walking down a road

793
00:51:30.495 --> 00:51:31.845
where you have two sides of the road

794
00:51:31.905 --> 00:51:33.165
and in the distance they meet.

795
00:51:33.745 --> 00:51:36.445
And that's a bad analogy because they actually don't meet.

796
00:51:36.905 --> 00:51:41.685
But, but I like the visual is, uh,

797
00:51:41.805 --> 00:51:44.005
there's a place in which it's gonna make sense at the end.

798
00:51:44.005 --> 00:51:45.005
There's a better analogy

799
00:51:45.005 --> 00:51:46.325
somewhere, but I'm not thinking of it.

800
00:51:46.985 --> 00:51:49.565
But, um, yeah, I think that's, that's a good point.

801
00:51:50.385 --> 00:51:52.085
And I think it's important, even,

802
00:51:52.225 --> 00:51:56.365
and we've talked about this, that some of those points of,

803
00:51:56.625 --> 00:51:59.365
uh, conflict in our thinking

804
00:51:59.865 --> 00:52:03.205
or in, in our trying to understand whether it's time

805
00:52:03.345 --> 00:52:05.285
or, uh, providence

806
00:52:05.345 --> 00:52:09.085
or whatever it is, it's, I think a actually part

807
00:52:09.085 --> 00:52:12.605
of our sanctification, that there are things in the word

808
00:52:12.605 --> 00:52:13.605
of God that are challenging.

809
00:52:14.345 --> 00:52:17.245
You know, like I, in the beginning, I think, uh, the first,

810
00:52:18.265 --> 00:52:21.085
the first time we met, we read from,

811
00:52:21.145 --> 00:52:25.845
it was second Peter three, where he says, you know, um, the,

812
00:52:26.155 --> 00:52:28.525
that there's people in the world who would take, like,

813
00:52:28.525 --> 00:52:29.565
they take the words of Paul

814
00:52:30.185 --> 00:52:32.085
and they just, like, they do all the other scriptures,

815
00:52:32.085 --> 00:52:34.405
they twist it to their own destruction

816
00:52:34.405 --> 00:52:36.725
and cause them ignorant and unstable people.

817
00:52:37.585 --> 00:52:40.605
And, and so the, the recognition there that I love is

818
00:52:40.605 --> 00:52:41.805
that there are things in the

819
00:52:41.805 --> 00:52:42.925
Bible that are hard to understand.

820
00:52:42.945 --> 00:52:47.005
He even says that, but the encouragement is that, uh,

821
00:52:47.105 --> 00:52:48.565
we shouldn't be daunted by that.

822
00:52:49.105 --> 00:52:52.165
And in fact, there's a warning what not to do, which is

823
00:52:52.165 --> 00:52:54.285
what we shouldn't do is we shouldn't twist it.

824
00:52:54.715 --> 00:52:55.885
Okay, well, I don't understand,

825
00:52:55.885 --> 00:52:57.285
so I'm gonna make it say something else.

826
00:52:57.705 --> 00:53:00.165
But that's a warning. Like, that's ignorant

827
00:53:00.185 --> 00:53:01.605
and unstable, don't do that.

828
00:53:02.105 --> 00:53:07.085
But the thing we do is we say, I want to believe God,

829
00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:10.965
and so Lord, help me and might say, Lord, help my unbelief,

830
00:53:10.965 --> 00:53:14.605
or, or help me understand where it's not crystal clear yet.

831
00:53:15.185 --> 00:53:18.085
And, um, you know, I, I mean, you probably all experienced,

832
00:53:18.205 --> 00:53:19.725
I certainly have things

833
00:53:19.725 --> 00:53:21.765
that I feel like I don't understand here,

834
00:53:22.185 --> 00:53:23.285
but then through life,

835
00:53:23.505 --> 00:53:25.965
and that's why you keep reading the Bible, right?

836
00:53:26.105 --> 00:53:27.725
You encounter a problem in the Bible here,

837
00:53:28.025 --> 00:53:30.085
and then, you know, 500 pages later you figure

838
00:53:30.105 --> 00:53:31.285
it out over here.

839
00:53:31.865 --> 00:53:33.525
And, uh, or it's kinda like the idea

840
00:53:33.525 --> 00:53:35.845
of the New Testament explains

841
00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:37.925
what the Old Testament contains, what, you know,

842
00:53:37.925 --> 00:53:40.525
you keep reading and God will explain at some point.

843
00:53:40.785 --> 00:53:42.925
And sometimes it just takes Christian maturity

844
00:53:42.985 --> 00:53:44.885
and the grace of God and the,

845
00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:47.485
and the light of the spirit to see that over time.

846
00:53:47.905 --> 00:53:50.125
And then, and to recognize that there, there may not,

847
00:53:50.125 --> 00:53:52.845
that may not happen with a certain thing in life,

848
00:53:53.345 --> 00:53:55.205
but to also say, Hey, God, is God,

849
00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:57.045
let God be true in every man a liar.

850
00:53:57.225 --> 00:53:58.885
You know, like when God has spoken on a thing,

851
00:53:59.205 --> 00:54:01.685
I may not have perfect knowledge of that, but,

852
00:54:01.945 --> 00:54:03.045
but I'm gonna choose

853
00:54:03.045 --> 00:54:05.725
to say I believe this even if I don't fully understand it,

854
00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.005
even if I don't like it.

855
00:54:07.205 --> 00:54:08.645
I mean, like, culturally, right?

856
00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:10.365
There's things in the Bible that are not popular

857
00:54:10.505 --> 00:54:11.725
to say out loud, right?

858
00:54:12.155 --> 00:54:14.645
Like, it's not popular to say a lot

859
00:54:14.645 --> 00:54:15.685
of things that the Bible says.

860
00:54:15.945 --> 00:54:17.325
And so the choice that we have is,

861
00:54:17.325 --> 00:54:18.925
are we gonna shy away from most things?

862
00:54:19.545 --> 00:54:21.445
Uh, obviously you don't have to be mean about it,

863
00:54:21.665 --> 00:54:23.565
but I don't frankly know many people who are.

864
00:54:23.985 --> 00:54:27.165
And so the temptation for us though, is to not, is

865
00:54:27.165 --> 00:54:28.605
to back away from things that,

866
00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:31.765
that the culture doesn't like, as opposed to going, well,

867
00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:33.525
hey, a good and gracious

868
00:54:33.545 --> 00:54:35.925
and loving God has said these things

869
00:54:36.465 --> 00:54:37.885
and I want to believe them,

870
00:54:37.985 --> 00:54:39.765
and I want to be influenced by them.

871
00:54:39.945 --> 00:54:42.445
And I want to align my thinking with them like Romans 12,

872
00:54:42.745 --> 00:54:45.045
to have my, to be renewed in the spirit of my mind.

873
00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:47.125
And just because I don't understand it

874
00:54:47.145 --> 00:54:50.245
or I don't see it, you know, that it doesn't mean

875
00:54:50.245 --> 00:54:52.565
that I define reality, right?

876
00:54:52.775 --> 00:54:54.125
We're studying we're creatures,

877
00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:55.525
and God is the creator anyway.

878
00:54:55.965 --> 00:54:59.485
I think, um, at the end of the day, it's kind of an issue

879
00:54:59.485 --> 00:55:00.485
of our sanctification.

880
00:55:00.905 --> 00:55:02.365
Do we believe, do we trust him?

881
00:55:02.665 --> 00:55:05.765
Do we trust that God is faithful, that his word is true,

882
00:55:06.305 --> 00:55:07.605
and, uh, we're gonna believe it even

883
00:55:07.605 --> 00:55:08.725
when we don't fully get it?

884
00:55:08.985 --> 00:55:10.965
And we'll grow in grace over time.

885
00:55:11.425 --> 00:55:13.285
And, uh, for me, that's the challenge that I feel.

886
00:55:14.225 --> 00:55:17.985
Um, anything else anybody wants to

887
00:55:18.935 --> 00:55:20.225
include or add or

888
00:55:21.245 --> 00:55:24.185
You mentioned you asked the, the greatest commandment

889
00:55:24.885 --> 00:55:27.185
and the fact that it is the greatest commandment

890
00:55:27.205 --> 00:55:28.305
and it involves love

891
00:55:29.245 --> 00:55:31.185
and scripture tells us the greatest issues

892
00:55:31.185 --> 00:55:33.625
of life are matters of the heart, right?

893
00:55:35.125 --> 00:55:38.825
So having that freedom to choose

894
00:55:39.725 --> 00:55:41.665
how better can you define true love?

895
00:55:41.695 --> 00:55:45.305
Because if it's forced, if it's controlled, how can

896
00:55:45.305 --> 00:55:47.345
that be the love that God wants?

897
00:55:47.535 --> 00:55:49.105
Yeah. Especially since it made it,

898
00:55:49.125 --> 00:55:51.345
he made it the greatest commandment Yeah.

899
00:55:51.405 --> 00:55:52.985
To come from us. Sure.

900
00:55:53.685 --> 00:55:57.985
So yeah, it makes it make a little bit more sense than as,

901
00:55:58.045 --> 00:56:00.305
as mysterious it as it can be.

902
00:56:00.775 --> 00:56:02.785
Yeah. It it definitely has some reason

903
00:56:02.875 --> 00:56:04.465
there. Yeah. Some logic

904
00:56:04.465 --> 00:56:05.465
There. That's

905
00:56:05.465 --> 00:56:07.865
good. Yeah, no, that's good.

906
00:56:08.405 --> 00:56:09.945
And we think about God, sometimes we think,

907
00:56:09.945 --> 00:56:10.985
well, that doesn't feel real loving.

908
00:56:11.265 --> 00:56:12.465
I don't know if you ever had children,

909
00:56:13.015 --> 00:56:15.065
your kids always feel like everything you do is loving,

910
00:56:16.325 --> 00:56:18.185
you know, sometimes they're right, right?

911
00:56:18.185 --> 00:56:20.225
You're not real loving. But other times,

912
00:56:20.285 --> 00:56:21.345
you're, you're right.

913
00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:23.805
And they're wrong. And what you're doing

914
00:56:23.865 --> 00:56:25.125
and what you're telling them is,

915
00:56:25.505 --> 00:56:27.605
is loving is the most loving thing you can say.

916
00:56:28.145 --> 00:56:30.845
So yeah. So at the end of the day, we're what we're still,

917
00:56:30.845 --> 00:56:33.205
what the major feature of

918
00:56:33.235 --> 00:56:36.725
what we've talked about in this semester is the doctrine

919
00:56:36.725 --> 00:56:40.325
of God, the, the idea that, so we talked about theology,

920
00:56:40.915 --> 00:56:44.525
sort of the definition of that word is a combination of, uh,

921
00:56:44.825 --> 00:56:48.325
of God and study or a study, the doctrine of God.

922
00:56:48.745 --> 00:56:50.325
Uh, it's who God is, what he's like,

923
00:56:50.705 --> 00:56:52.805
and what he has done, what he's going to do.

924
00:56:53.465 --> 00:56:55.965
And the way that we know that is what he said in his work.

925
00:56:57.205 --> 00:56:59.525
I like the illustration of when we're trying

926
00:56:59.525 --> 00:57:01.365
to dig deep in the knowledge of God,

927
00:57:01.365 --> 00:57:03.765
and especially when you feel like your, your sort

928
00:57:03.765 --> 00:57:05.725
of mind's being stretched and, and,

929
00:57:05.745 --> 00:57:07.925
and you're thinking new thoughts about God and,

930
00:57:08.065 --> 00:57:09.445
and making progress in that.

931
00:57:09.905 --> 00:57:11.525
It, it's, I like the image of it.

932
00:57:11.785 --> 00:57:15.685
Say if you're standing at the, at the ocean on a, on a beach

933
00:57:15.685 --> 00:57:18.365
or the ocean, uh, sorry, I thought that was empty.

934
00:57:19.425 --> 00:57:23.445
And, and you've got a cup. I'll just have a fake one here.

935
00:57:24.385 --> 00:57:27.725
And you scoop up a cup of water out of the ocean,

936
00:57:27.755 --> 00:57:30.445
like the illustration being sort of, God is like the ocean.

937
00:57:31.105 --> 00:57:34.765
And where our brains are, like this cup, you know, scoop it

938
00:57:35.425 --> 00:57:39.125
and and it's like, man, you know, you've got this cup full.

939
00:57:39.125 --> 00:57:43.805
Your cup is full actually, but it, it's inexhaustible.

940
00:57:44.405 --> 00:57:46.485
I mean, functionally, obviously the ocean is limited,

941
00:57:47.025 --> 00:57:49.325
but the analogy is, it is limitless.

942
00:57:49.595 --> 00:57:53.525
It's, but so the knowledge of God is so vast and awesome

943
00:57:54.545 --> 00:57:57.765
and endless and limitless, that

944
00:57:58.425 --> 00:58:02.525
we can continually fill the cup

945
00:58:02.585 --> 00:58:04.845
of our hearts and our minds

946
00:58:04.985 --> 00:58:08.325
and never exhaust the knowledge of God.

947
00:58:09.145 --> 00:58:10.285
And I just want to encourage you,

948
00:58:10.935 --> 00:58:12.445
don't be discouraged by that.

949
00:58:12.765 --> 00:58:14.165
'cause you can't read to the end.

950
00:58:14.785 --> 00:58:18.445
We will spend all eternity filling our cups.

951
00:58:18.525 --> 00:58:20.445
I mean, I think, like, I love the analogy we'll

952
00:58:20.445 --> 00:58:21.485
get into this next semester.

953
00:58:21.525 --> 00:58:24.765
I love the analogy. I think, uh, Jonathan Edwards, truth

954
00:58:25.345 --> 00:58:26.725
of the, what do you call it?

955
00:58:27.265 --> 00:58:30.725
The, uh, you know, uh, it's the ever increase

956
00:58:31.265 --> 00:58:33.085
of joy in God.

957
00:58:33.635 --> 00:58:37.485
It's this idea that we have a capacity right now

958
00:58:38.185 --> 00:58:42.445
in our broken, simple being sanctified

959
00:58:42.505 --> 00:58:46.885
and redeemed state to enjoy the knowledge of God

960
00:58:46.885 --> 00:58:48.045
and to be affected by it.

961
00:58:48.865 --> 00:58:51.685
And, and as we are getting, uh,

962
00:58:51.685 --> 00:58:53.285
growing in the knowledge we've got now

963
00:58:53.285 --> 00:58:56.405
as we're being sanctified in Christ throughout our lives,

964
00:58:56.555 --> 00:59:00.165
that cap, that capacity, does expand over time.

965
00:59:01.145 --> 00:59:04.565
But I think it's, in Edwards, he was sort

966
00:59:04.565 --> 00:59:09.405
of drawing this picture of, of the ever increasing ability

967
00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:13.525
that we'll have in our resurrected bodies

968
00:59:14.345 --> 00:59:18.645
to absorb and to consider and understand

969
00:59:18.985 --> 00:59:23.685
and explore infinitely unfolding

970
00:59:24.195 --> 00:59:25.685
more and more of the knowledge of God.

971
00:59:26.145 --> 00:59:27.805
And it never reaching an end,

972
00:59:27.805 --> 00:59:31.085
because our cup has always, the cup may be enlarging,

973
00:59:31.465 --> 00:59:33.285
but the ocean is limitless.

974
00:59:33.365 --> 00:59:34.885
I don't know if I did a good job on that,

975
00:59:34.885 --> 00:59:39.045
but I love the analogy of, uh, of our cup filling our cup

976
00:59:39.595 --> 00:59:41.965
with the fullness of the ocean still out there.

977
00:59:42.505 --> 00:59:45.245
So we swim in it, and, uh, and it's awesome.

978
00:59:45.665 --> 00:59:48.205
Here's a, uh, job.

979
00:59:48.205 --> 00:59:52.725
26 14 is our memory verse, uh, only the first part of it.

980
00:59:53.105 --> 00:59:54.365
Uh, you can memorize the whole thing,

981
00:59:54.705 --> 00:59:56.845
but I just put the first part on here.

982
00:59:57.385 --> 01:00:00.605
It says, behold, these are, but the outskirts of his ways,

983
01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:04.245
and how small a whisper do we hear of him,

984
01:00:05.145 --> 01:00:07.485
but the thunder of his power, who can understand?

985
01:00:08.145 --> 01:00:11.325
And, uh, I love, Joe has a couple of verses like this where,

986
01:00:11.985 --> 01:00:14.245
you know, you see Joe, obviously, I, how many

987
01:00:14.245 --> 01:00:15.645
of you guys don't even want to read Joe?

988
01:00:16.745 --> 01:00:17.885
You, you're like, Hey,

989
01:00:18.145 --> 01:00:20.565
the thing I really wanna do today is study the book of joke.

990
01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.845
And, and to which I would say we, you know,

991
01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:26.445
don't be afraid of the book of joke.

992
01:00:27.205 --> 01:00:28.325
I, I think if you feel that way,

993
01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.245
maybe sometimes we think if I read

994
01:00:30.245 --> 01:00:31.445
it, it's gonna happen to me.

995
01:00:32.075 --> 01:00:36.005
Okay? So don't be deceived.

996
01:00:36.305 --> 01:00:38.365
That's not what happens. Um,

997
01:00:39.315 --> 01:00:41.485
what actually happens is there's sort of, I mean,

998
01:00:41.485 --> 01:00:43.245
we could talk about job all day long,

999
01:00:43.345 --> 01:00:47.005
but um, in the Book of Job, we see man,

1000
01:00:47.635 --> 01:00:52.325
even in his deepest misery, encountering the

1001
01:00:52.845 --> 01:00:56.485
absolute glory and power of God and the wisdom of God.

1002
01:00:57.065 --> 01:01:00.045
And, uh, so even in the midst of human suffering,

1003
01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:03.005
God's a work in a way to reveal himself to

1004
01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:04.005
where we read things like this.

1005
01:01:04.005 --> 01:01:07.285
Just a reminder of, uh, the outskirts of his way.

1006
01:01:07.285 --> 01:01:09.405
It's just the cup from the ocean

1007
01:01:10.065 --> 01:01:12.205
and, um, the thunder of his power.

1008
01:01:12.555 --> 01:01:13.925
Like you think about the word thunder.

1009
01:01:14.085 --> 01:01:15.325
I mean, I know we're in Oklahoma,

1010
01:01:15.635 --> 01:01:17.045
there's a basketball team here.

1011
01:01:17.185 --> 01:01:21.485
But, um, so the thunder is not even the thing, right?

1012
01:01:22.425 --> 01:01:25.565
The thunder is the result of the thing, right?

1013
01:01:25.585 --> 01:01:28.485
The thing is the lightning, the, the force and the energy.

1014
01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:33.085
And so just the thunder of his power, who can understand it?

1015
01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:35.485
And so job is in awe, right?

1016
01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:38.685
And, um, so, and if you,

1017
01:01:38.745 --> 01:01:43.165
and if you like job, either a lot like job

1018
01:01:43.265 --> 01:01:47.365
or a little like job are either currently suffering, uh,

1019
01:01:47.385 --> 01:01:51.725
or you go into a season of suffering, the reminder

1020
01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:55.085
of a book like this is that God is still faithful.

1021
01:01:55.585 --> 01:01:58.845
God is still awesome, and there's going to be a day in which

1022
01:01:59.225 --> 01:02:01.645
that's not your experience anymore.

1023
01:02:02.425 --> 01:02:05.125
But what will be your experience at the end is the glory

1024
01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:08.805
of God forever and all your problem solved in the end.

1025
01:02:09.235 --> 01:02:12.645
It's just that it feels long right now. But that's all.

1026
01:02:12.845 --> 01:02:14.565
'cause we have special revelation from God,

1027
01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:17.245
where God has spoken, and we can look at his word

1028
01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:18.565
and we can say, these things are true.

1029
01:02:19.065 --> 01:02:21.125
We believe them. I'm gonna trust in them,

1030
01:02:21.145 --> 01:02:23.285
and I'm gonna obey, and I'm gonna trust,

1031
01:02:23.285 --> 01:02:24.325
like, what's the old song?

1032
01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:27.205
Trust and obey. Why no other way? There's no other way.

1033
01:02:27.615 --> 01:02:30.405
Jesus. That's it. I have to trust and obeying.

1034
01:02:31.445 --> 01:02:35.205
I wanna sing it. You want somebody wanna lead us

1035
01:02:35.635 --> 01:02:37.725
When we walk with the Lord.

1036
01:02:38.665 --> 01:02:38.925
I'm not.

1037
01:02:43.105 --> 01:02:44.365
Hes on our way.

1038
01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:47.965
While we do His goodwill.

1039
01:02:48.625 --> 01:02:53.085
He abes with us, him and with all will trust

1040
01:02:53.545 --> 01:02:56.325
and trust

1041
01:02:56.625 --> 01:03:00.645
and don't beg for, there's no other way

1042
01:03:01.465 --> 01:03:06.245
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust

1043
01:03:06.545 --> 01:03:07.965
and don't make.

1044
01:03:09.695 --> 01:03:11.645
Thank you, man. That's awesome.

1045
01:03:12.615 --> 01:03:13.765
Steve, I think we're gonna,

1046
01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:15.605
so were you gonna sing or were we gonna

1047
01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:16.605
Say? No, no, I wasn't gonna

1048
01:03:16.605 --> 01:03:16.965
sing at all.

1049
01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:21.085
I think that, uh, one of the things that occurred to me

1050
01:03:21.085 --> 01:03:23.885
during this semester, uh, is

1051
01:03:23.885 --> 01:03:25.925
that when you said it a minute ago,

1052
01:03:25.985 --> 01:03:27.245
you said you shouldn't be afraid

1053
01:03:27.245 --> 01:03:29.565
to read the book a joke, but I think you should.

1054
01:03:30.085 --> 01:03:32.005
I learned and reinforce the fact

1055
01:03:32.005 --> 01:03:34.365
that you shouldn't be afraid to study theology.

1056
01:03:34.755 --> 01:03:37.845
Yeah. And you know, you say, well, I went

1057
01:03:37.845 --> 01:03:39.885
to a systematic theology class this semester.

1058
01:03:39.965 --> 01:03:41.085
I said, why did you do that?

1059
01:03:41.705 --> 01:03:43.725
And then you have something else that you could do.

1060
01:03:44.355 --> 01:03:46.205
Well, I'm being sarcastic there,

1061
01:03:46.205 --> 01:03:49.285
but I'm simply saying that by looking at these doctrines,

1062
01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.405
by listening to my brothers who were teaching

1063
01:03:52.505 --> 01:03:53.965
and, and things like that,

1064
01:03:54.785 --> 01:03:59.285
Uh, I don't, some things I knew and read about

1065
01:03:59.505 --> 01:04:02.525
and studied and prayed about others I didn't.

1066
01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:05.485
But I learned a lot, continue to learn a lot.

1067
01:04:06.105 --> 01:04:08.565
Uh, and also it gives me comfort to know that

1068
01:04:09.175 --> 01:04:13.965
these doctrines have been studied wrangled with,

1069
01:04:14.945 --> 01:04:18.285
argued about people have had different thoughts about

1070
01:04:18.285 --> 01:04:19.605
those with centuries.

1071
01:04:19.795 --> 01:04:23.405
Yeah. But we all have their freedom to read about them,

1072
01:04:23.465 --> 01:04:25.165
to study them, to read God's word,

1073
01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:28.485
and then we form our own thoughts with the help

1074
01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:30.085
of the Holy Spirit as to

1075
01:04:30.085 --> 01:04:31.445
what those really mean in our lives.

1076
01:04:31.475 --> 01:04:33.725
Then we have discussions about those, those help us.

1077
01:04:34.265 --> 01:04:37.085
So that continues, I guess my word

1078
01:04:37.145 --> 01:04:39.925
or my thought to be is don't be afraid to study theology.

1079
01:04:40.275 --> 01:04:42.765
There's some big words here. There's no question about that.

1080
01:04:43.305 --> 01:04:44.445
Uh, but, and,

1081
01:04:44.585 --> 01:04:45.805
and at the end of the semester,

1082
01:04:45.805 --> 01:04:47.445
we're not gonna say, well, we've done that.

1083
01:04:47.445 --> 01:04:48.365
We're gonna check the box.

1084
01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:49.525
We don't have to have good about it.

1085
01:04:49.525 --> 01:04:51.045
Again, it's kinda like reading the Bible

1086
01:04:51.045 --> 01:04:52.405
through once a year.

1087
01:04:52.915 --> 01:04:54.725
Well, I've done it once, I have to do it again.

1088
01:04:55.405 --> 01:04:57.725
Absolutely not. Uh, I've learned that.

1089
01:04:58.065 --> 01:05:00.485
And so you just keep going and, uh, that's good.

1090
01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:04.245
So I just think it's, I appreciate the folks that are here

1091
01:05:04.245 --> 01:05:07.445
because, uh, you weren't afraid to want to do this.

1092
01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:10.365
And there's a good number of folks here,

1093
01:05:10.465 --> 01:05:12.565
but there's a large number of folks that weren't here.

1094
01:05:12.905 --> 01:05:16.285
And so we want to encourage them. I think, Hey, cut.

1095
01:05:17.895 --> 01:05:21.845
It'll be okay. You, you, you have to be able

1096
01:05:21.845 --> 01:05:23.205
to think about and look at that.

1097
01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:25.565
I, I don't accept everything Wayne Gruder wrote in his,

1098
01:05:25.565 --> 01:05:27.765
in his books, but I don't have to, right?

1099
01:05:27.915 --> 01:05:30.365
Yeah. But, but, but God's word is

1100
01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:31.365
There. Absolutely. Yeah.

1101
01:05:31.365 --> 01:05:33.565
No, it's good.

1102
01:05:39.925 --> 01:05:44.765
Anything else? I love this quote in

1103
01:05:44.765 --> 01:05:48.005
John Calvin's, um, institutes of the Christian religion.

1104
01:05:48.105 --> 01:05:50.765
He says, in knowing God, each of us

1105
01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.045
also comes to know himself.

1106
01:05:54.945 --> 01:05:59.485
And so in Calvin, whatever you think of him, he, he has,

1107
01:05:59.645 --> 01:06:03.645
I think, a lot of insight on this idea of struggle

1108
01:06:03.645 --> 01:06:05.685
between knowing God and knowing himself,

1109
01:06:06.345 --> 01:06:09.405
and that we only know ourselves in light of God.

1110
01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:11.445
Because if we're creatures

1111
01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:14.285
and if we, if this is what we believe,

1112
01:06:14.285 --> 01:06:15.445
which obviously we've been studying,

1113
01:06:15.545 --> 01:06:16.925
and we would say that's it.

1114
01:06:17.575 --> 01:06:19.245
We're creatures of a creator.

1115
01:06:19.985 --> 01:06:23.765
And more than that, we are made in his image and likeness.

1116
01:06:24.425 --> 01:06:28.005
And so we almost can't even understand humanity of,

1117
01:06:28.015 --> 01:06:31.525
apart from understanding the nature of God himself.

1118
01:06:32.825 --> 01:06:33.925
Uh, in fact.

1119
01:06:34.425 --> 01:06:37.645
So when, when we realize we're creatures under his rule

1120
01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:41.445
and reign under his care and direction, under his precepts

1121
01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:45.525
and protection, um, these are all things that are,

1122
01:06:45.525 --> 01:06:47.605
they're sort of like light and gravity.

1123
01:06:47.925 --> 01:06:51.205
I think it was CS Lewis who said, I, I, he's,

1124
01:06:51.205 --> 01:06:52.245
it's kind of a different topic.

1125
01:06:52.705 --> 01:06:56.565
He said, I don't believe in God because I see him,

1126
01:06:57.505 --> 01:07:00.365
but because I see everything else in light

1127
01:07:00.365 --> 01:07:02.005
of him, sort of like the sun.

1128
01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:03.725
You can't look at the sun.

1129
01:07:03.885 --> 01:07:05.565
I mean, now we have telescopes that'll do this,

1130
01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:08.685
but you can't look at the sun

1131
01:07:09.385 --> 01:07:11.325
and study it with your naked eye.

1132
01:07:11.705 --> 01:07:14.005
But you certainly can see everything else

1133
01:07:14.715 --> 01:07:16.845
because of the sun and in light of it.

1134
01:07:17.145 --> 01:07:19.845
And so, like, we're like the gravity, you know, like you go

1135
01:07:19.845 --> 01:07:21.925
to the moon, or I guess the moon, there's some gravity.

1136
01:07:22.185 --> 01:07:23.885
You go into outer space, there's no gravity,

1137
01:07:24.065 --> 01:07:25.125
so you just float around.

1138
01:07:25.785 --> 01:07:29.165
But, and so in our culture right now, uh,

1139
01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:32.125
we are attempting culturally to completely

1140
01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:35.605
unmoor ourselves from the knowledge of God.

1141
01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:39.405
And so what that turns into is darkness.

1142
01:07:39.905 --> 01:07:42.485
And the lack of gravity, right there is,

1143
01:07:42.485 --> 01:07:43.765
so we're just floating around.

1144
01:07:44.305 --> 01:07:47.245
We don't know what's up or down. We're in the dark.

1145
01:07:47.295 --> 01:07:50.485
We're just grasping. And so when we think about

1146
01:07:51.225 --> 01:07:54.245
the way this plays out in our, in the world, whether it's,

1147
01:07:54.665 --> 01:07:56.245
you know, the sort of the white lies

1148
01:07:56.245 --> 01:07:59.845
that we tell each other, or the major lies

1149
01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:02.565
that the world's telling right now, all the ways that,

1150
01:08:02.565 --> 01:08:06.725
the point of suggesting that, that ontologically like, like

1151
01:08:06.865 --> 01:08:09.765
by nature, that a boy could be a girl

1152
01:08:10.065 --> 01:08:13.525
or a man trapped in a woman's body, or that

1153
01:08:13.525 --> 01:08:17.085
because of that we're gonna go mutilate perfectly healthy

1154
01:08:17.855 --> 01:08:19.725
human bodies, uh,

1155
01:08:19.725 --> 01:08:23.245
because of this, uh, what I would call not just etiology,

1156
01:08:23.425 --> 01:08:24.565
but idolatry.

1157
01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:27.645
Uh, it's, it's because there's no light

1158
01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:29.565
and it's because there's no gravity.

1159
01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:32.405
So there's no, how do you know which weighs up or down?

1160
01:08:33.225 --> 01:08:35.005
How do you know what, what's in front

1161
01:08:35.005 --> 01:08:36.005
of you if you're in the dark?

1162
01:08:36.655 --> 01:08:39.635
And so, without the light of God's word, anything becomes

1163
01:08:40.435 --> 01:08:42.835
possible until reality sets in.

1164
01:08:43.255 --> 01:08:45.595
And that's the, the, the danger

1165
01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.955
of believing things that aren't true.

1166
01:08:48.855 --> 01:08:52.435
And, and what's so important about believing things

1167
01:08:52.435 --> 01:08:55.875
that are true and about laboring to know

1168
01:08:56.535 --> 01:08:58.355
and believe the things that are true.

1169
01:08:59.095 --> 01:09:04.075
And so I think there's a lot of practical application, um,

1170
01:09:05.195 --> 01:09:06.515
whenever we talk about the knowledge of God.

1171
01:09:06.515 --> 01:09:10.155
So theology and the knowledge of God, I wrote in my notes,

1172
01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:14.235
have very relevant and practical implications in our lives.

1173
01:09:15.015 --> 01:09:17.875
And, um, so let it be light and gravity to you.

1174
01:09:19.135 --> 01:09:22.435
Um, the, the sim as you know, you've been here,

1175
01:09:22.435 --> 01:09:24.715
the seminary students, uh, they, one

1176
01:09:24.715 --> 01:09:26.795
of the assignments is they get to take a few minutes

1177
01:09:27.215 --> 01:09:29.395
and guide us through a bit more discussion.

1178
01:09:29.735 --> 01:09:32.555
And so Jessica Doby, I'm gonna turn it over to you for,

1179
01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:34.275
uh, for that.

1180
01:09:34.495 --> 01:09:36.315
And then I'll come up afterwards

1181
01:09:36.315 --> 01:09:37.395
and we'll sing one more song.

1182
01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:45.235
Hello, I'm Jessica Doby.

1183
01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:49.795
Hello. Hopefully you can hear me better now. Yes.

1184
01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:51.395
Um, I'm Jessica Doby.

1185
01:09:51.535 --> 01:09:53.595
I'm one of the ministry apprentices here.

1186
01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:56.195
Um, I focus on the international students.

1187
01:09:56.495 --> 01:09:58.875
So if you wanna host an international student

1188
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:00.155
for Christmas, you let me know.

1189
01:10:00.935 --> 01:10:02.915
Um, the handout

1190
01:10:02.915 --> 01:10:05.515
that you got on the table hopefully has a few questions

1191
01:10:05.545 --> 01:10:06.875
that I'm gonna go over.

1192
01:10:07.105 --> 01:10:10.275
It's the sheet that has the four questions, um,

1193
01:10:10.505 --> 01:10:11.875
with a little bit of a change.

1194
01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:13.875
'cause Mark covered one of the questions,

1195
01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:15.355
which is amazing and great.

1196
01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:16.875
So I'm gonna change your last question.

1197
01:10:17.615 --> 01:10:20.555
Um, so with the last question, we're gonna change it

1198
01:10:20.575 --> 01:10:24.595
to which of the topics covered this semester do you plan

1199
01:10:24.775 --> 01:10:25.875
to learn more about?

1200
01:10:27.255 --> 01:10:30.355
But otherwise, just go over those few questions

1201
01:10:30.425 --> 01:10:31.955
with the neighbors around you.

1202
01:10:32.555 --> 01:10:35.955
I personally love input from others that's not sarcastic,

1203
01:10:36.495 --> 01:10:38.395
so I would love for you all to do the same.

1204
01:10:38.395 --> 01:10:39.995
Just get to know your neighbor. 'cause you may not

1205
01:10:39.995 --> 01:10:41.155
see them next semester.

1206
01:10:41.855 --> 01:10:44.875
And so, um, just go over these four questions

1207
01:10:45.615 --> 01:10:47.315
for about eight minutes or so,

1208
01:10:47.455 --> 01:10:48.715
and then we'll come back together

1209
01:10:49.455 --> 01:10:51.915
and we'll share about what we have learned.

1210
01:10:52.855 --> 01:10:54.955
Um, yeah, that's it.

1211
01:10:56.645 --> 01:10:57.075
Thank you.

1212
01:11:04.335 --> 01:11:05.795
So I got the clock. I'll let you know

1213
01:11:15.745 --> 01:11:20.685
Name's, uh,

1214
01:11:20.925 --> 01:11:22.205
I missed the last one.

1215
01:11:42.795 --> 01:11:43.405
Spin it around

1216
01:11:58.585 --> 01:12:03.165
Glenda or Belinda?

1217
01:12:05.345 --> 01:12:07.205
Glenda. Glenda.

1218
01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:11.165
Well,

1219
01:12:23.525 --> 01:12:23.805
question I

1220
01:12:46.785 --> 01:12:47.445
is a good word.

1221
01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:50.085
Pleasure and pain that drives every

1222
01:12:53.265 --> 01:12:54.325
lot of psychological

1223
01:12:59.115 --> 01:12:59.965
from physical.

1224
01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:04.125
God. Scripture tells us

1225
01:13:16.555 --> 01:13:17.285
there's no limits.

1226
01:13:17.385 --> 01:13:17.805
No s

1227
01:16:04.665 --> 01:16:07.085
So what she was saying,

1228
01:16:09.225 --> 01:16:13.245
so in a sense, in the words that I,

1229
01:16:13.325 --> 01:16:14.605
I want to try to summarize here.

1230
01:16:15.145 --> 01:16:17.605
No, no. The idea, I'm, what I'm trying to say is

1231
01:16:17.605 --> 01:16:20.845
what I hear you saying to me in simple terms.

1232
01:16:20.885 --> 01:16:23.085
Maybe that's the way I should say is

1233
01:16:23.085 --> 01:16:25.645
that it's almost like we should have a filter

1234
01:16:27.635 --> 01:16:32.085
that God sees us as that we should see others as a filter.

1235
01:16:32.345 --> 01:16:35.685
One other words, you see sexuality, you see her

1236
01:16:35.685 --> 01:16:39.285
as a year potential child creation of God.

1237
01:16:39.865 --> 01:16:42.125
So it's, it's like the word gives us almost

1238
01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.365
like a different kind of filter.

1239
01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:46.885
Like, we'll see Marcus talking about we have lenses,

1240
01:16:48.105 --> 01:16:50.445
we can see the sun, we can right out the sun and study.

1241
01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:55.525
So the scripture gives us that filter to, to see, see,

1242
01:16:55.985 --> 01:16:58.765
you know, and, and see the good

1243
01:16:58.835 --> 01:17:01.605
because, you know, Philippians four, eight talks to us about

1244
01:17:02.145 --> 01:17:03.485
how we really should live.

1245
01:17:04.185 --> 01:17:07.445
You know, what's, what's, what's, what's pure,

1246
01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:08.925
what's true, right?

1247
01:17:46.905 --> 01:17:48.165
But we don't always hear that.

1248
01:17:48.165 --> 01:17:49.285
They're not always gonna share.

1249
01:17:50.095 --> 01:17:52.365
We're gonna hold up long as they can.

1250
01:17:56.185 --> 01:18:00.765
And I got your words foundation. That's what I asked.

1251
01:18:00.765 --> 01:18:02.925
That's, that's, it's

1252
01:18:03.055 --> 01:18:06.405
dependable, doesn't change, right?

1253
01:18:07.035 --> 01:18:08.805
It's, that's pretty hard

1254
01:18:13.095 --> 01:18:15.685
foundation, how we should see through the darkness.

1255
01:18:17.665 --> 01:18:22.165
We, on the next question, that's pretty, pretty basic things

1256
01:18:23.705 --> 01:18:28.605
God does.

1257
01:19:02.475 --> 01:19:03.925
Yeah. That's what I have. Trust.

1258
01:19:03.945 --> 01:19:05.685
And then I think trust independence.

1259
01:19:21.525 --> 01:19:23.085
I know, but what does it say?

1260
01:19:27.275 --> 01:19:30.165
They just say him. I dunno.

1261
01:19:30.685 --> 01:19:32.445
Scripture say him.

1262
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:40.405
Oh, well it may say him. Does it say the father?

1263
01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:41.885
Does it say father? I dunno.

1264
01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:44.205
Aaron, does Aaron,

1265
01:19:45.345 --> 01:19:47.845
or maybe you guys know, you know, the video that we played

1266
01:19:47.845 --> 01:19:50.725
before every service it says we're desperately dependent on,

1267
01:19:52.225 --> 01:19:56.645
is it him, him, God, father, father, son, Christ.

1268
01:19:59.035 --> 01:20:00.445
Well then what are the elements better?

1269
01:20:00.465 --> 01:20:03.965
Now I'm gonna ask you Aaron. Aaron will though. Aaron will.

1270
01:20:04.515 --> 01:20:07.005
Okay. I put

1271
01:20:07.085 --> 01:20:07.925
Some pressure on Aaron,

1272
01:20:26.945 --> 01:20:28.085
On Jesus is

1273
01:20:43.495 --> 01:20:44.245
sorry to interrupt.

1274
01:20:48.265 --> 01:20:52.365
Yes. Yes. Trust in the benefit. Okay. Christ.

1275
01:20:53.105 --> 01:20:55.765
You know, something else too that I see here, number two

1276
01:20:56.865 --> 01:21:01.165
is we can be so

1277
01:21:01.185 --> 01:21:02.765
Pumped up in Ourself that we

1278
01:21:03.645 --> 01:21:04.645
Don't need hear His word.

1279
01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:09.405
On the Lord. On the Lord. Okay. Thank you. Wow. Well done.

1280
01:21:10.155 --> 01:21:13.525
Where'd your find that? Okay.

1281
01:21:14.215 --> 01:21:16.245
Sorry, I cut off in the conversations,

1282
01:21:17.225 --> 01:21:20.325
but I would love to hear what everyone had

1283
01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:22.445
to say about these questions.

1284
01:21:23.305 --> 01:21:26.645
Um, so if anyone had something that they personally shared

1285
01:21:26.745 --> 01:21:29.285
or someone in their group that they were talking

1286
01:21:29.285 --> 01:21:32.405
with shared, um, feel free to speak up on that.

1287
01:21:32.985 --> 01:21:34.525
Um, I'll start with the first question.

1288
01:21:35.065 --> 01:21:38.125
How should recognizing scripture God's word, um,

1289
01:21:38.385 --> 01:21:41.285
as our ultimate authority shape the way that we respond

1290
01:21:41.285 --> 01:21:43.645
to cultural or personal beliefs that conflict

1291
01:21:43.675 --> 01:21:45.085
with biblical teaching?

1292
01:21:46.665 --> 01:21:48.685
Is there anything that anyone thought on that?

1293
01:21:52.725 --> 01:21:54.645
I think it's important enough. It's not just our,

1294
01:21:55.955 --> 01:22:00.805
it's the, it doesn't justify to the people

1295
01:22:00.865 --> 01:22:02.725
who believe it applies to everyone.

1296
01:22:07.345 --> 01:22:09.725
The word, which was one

1297
01:22:09.725 --> 01:22:11.925
of the first things we studied in this class, the word

1298
01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.085
becomes our lens

1299
01:22:14.305 --> 01:22:16.645
or our filters marked reference to

1300
01:22:16.645 --> 01:22:18.565
how we can see the sun through a filter.

1301
01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:20.605
That word becomes our filter

1302
01:22:20.705 --> 01:22:25.405
and how we see the, the, the truth, the the,

1303
01:22:25.705 --> 01:22:28.005
the essence of who God is, his character,

1304
01:22:28.385 --> 01:22:33.085
and how that should influence and guide our lives.

1305
01:22:34.225 --> 01:22:35.765
But that word is that filter

1306
01:22:36.025 --> 01:22:40.365
and how we can in some way

1307
01:22:41.335 --> 01:22:46.045
grasp God in his eternal nature, his omni nature,

1308
01:22:46.345 --> 01:22:48.005
how we can grasp that through

1309
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:49.405
that word, that lens, that filter.

1310
01:22:55.265 --> 01:22:57.765
Um, our discussion about that included,

1311
01:22:58.435 --> 01:23:02.565
depending on your personality type, maybe, uh, there's some

1312
01:23:02.565 --> 01:23:05.605
of us who, you know, love to hear something new

1313
01:23:05.825 --> 01:23:08.725
and different and maybe it kind of sounds cool or exciting.

1314
01:23:09.465 --> 01:23:11.405
Uh, Paul might call that, you know,

1315
01:23:11.925 --> 01:23:13.365
tingling the ears or it ears.

1316
01:23:14.265 --> 01:23:17.485
But then other personality types really resist anything

1317
01:23:17.485 --> 01:23:20.285
that's new or unfamiliar or different, uh,

1318
01:23:20.305 --> 01:23:24.605
or there'll be challenging, uh, to their preconceived idea.

1319
01:23:25.235 --> 01:23:28.685
Both of those could be like, uh, ditches on either side

1320
01:23:28.685 --> 01:23:29.725
of the, the path.

1321
01:23:30.465 --> 01:23:33.285
And so what the scripture provides is a way

1322
01:23:33.305 --> 01:23:36.325
of taking every thought captive, the ones

1323
01:23:36.325 --> 01:23:39.725
that I already hold onto, and the ones that come to me

1324
01:23:39.755 --> 01:23:41.245
that I haven't thought of before,

1325
01:23:41.345 --> 01:23:42.565
but either, either way,

1326
01:23:44.215 --> 01:23:46.925
God's ultimate authority in his word is, is that lens

1327
01:23:46.945 --> 01:23:48.885
and that, that measuring to figure out

1328
01:23:48.885 --> 01:23:50.205
what is real and what is true.

1329
01:23:54.985 --> 01:23:57.485
Second question was, if God is knowable

1330
01:23:57.485 --> 01:23:59.085
but not fully comprehensible,

1331
01:23:59.465 --> 01:24:00.965
how does this affect your posture

1332
01:24:01.105 --> 01:24:02.565
and daily dependence on him?

1333
01:24:05.715 --> 01:24:07.765
This kind of relates to the scripture memory

1334
01:24:07.775 --> 01:24:09.085
first from today as well.

1335
01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.085
And Joe,

1336
01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:18.485
What Mark talked about in the, the cup in the ocean, you

1337
01:24:19.525 --> 01:24:22.405
remember never going to fully comprehend everything.

1338
01:24:25.195 --> 01:24:28.205
Totally heaven the Lord,

1339
01:24:28.465 --> 01:24:32.325
but, uh, we still want to

1340
01:24:33.995 --> 01:24:36.845
know, be upon as much as we can.

1341
01:24:36.915 --> 01:24:37.915
Here.

1342
01:24:43.825 --> 01:24:45.805
We best really depend on God, even

1343
01:24:45.865 --> 01:24:47.645
for knowledge, everything.

1344
01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.645
Read a scripture like 10 times

1345
01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:53.845
and then it like goes off.

1346
01:24:54.985 --> 01:24:58.045
And that document

1347
01:24:58.115 --> 01:24:59.115
Knowledge.

1348
01:25:05.095 --> 01:25:07.525
Third question was from the topics that we,

1349
01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:10.165
we have covered this semester, how will you apply

1350
01:25:10.165 --> 01:25:11.765
what we have learned to your life?

1351
01:25:17.025 --> 01:25:21.605
So that was number four, Whichever number

1352
01:25:23.545 --> 01:25:24.725
we changed, the last one.

1353
01:25:24.825 --> 01:25:27.525
So just the question that asks, from the topics

1354
01:25:27.595 --> 01:25:29.845
that we have covered this semester, how will you apply

1355
01:25:29.845 --> 01:25:31.365
what you have learned to your life?

1356
01:25:35.105 --> 01:25:39.085
So probably number three, now four on your paper. Yeah,

1357
01:25:39.305 --> 01:25:40.305
That's good.

1358
01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:44.965
Um, this scripture of Joe just really just cuts

1359
01:25:44.965 --> 01:25:47.005
through the reverence, the awe,

1360
01:25:47.945 --> 01:25:50.685
the, the overall.

1361
01:25:53.685 --> 01:25:56.205
I, like we said, a limitless nature of God

1362
01:25:57.025 --> 01:26:01.365
and how that is so humbling in how we

1363
01:26:02.385 --> 01:26:04.565
should commune with him and with others.

1364
01:26:04.865 --> 01:26:09.805
Uh, in sharing, you know, the, the, the, your sin, the, the,

1365
01:26:09.825 --> 01:26:14.285
the gospel, the, uh, you know, the, the great commission.

1366
01:26:14.635 --> 01:26:17.285
Just that whole essence of who he is, how

1367
01:26:17.285 --> 01:26:21.765
that should drive us, and, uh, be so humbling and,

1368
01:26:21.785 --> 01:26:24.485
and motivational to us in,

1369
01:26:24.705 --> 01:26:28.895
In What's really reflected in that scripture and joke.

1370
01:26:30.035 --> 01:26:31.035
So powerful.

1371
01:26:35.195 --> 01:26:37.735
I'm in a camp that, uh, books

1372
01:26:38.335 --> 01:26:39.975
probably don't change your life,

1373
01:26:40.235 --> 01:26:42.895
but paragraphs change your life

1374
01:26:43.155 --> 01:26:45.015
or even sentences change your life.

1375
01:26:45.115 --> 01:26:47.695
And, and, uh, the everywhere

1376
01:26:47.715 --> 01:26:50.215
and every win, I have to agree with Mark.

1377
01:26:50.515 --> 01:26:53.135
Um, that one's gonna stick with me for a long time

1378
01:26:53.805 --> 01:26:57.415
because it, it, it tells me one thing.

1379
01:26:57.535 --> 01:27:00.615
I knew one thing I had no clue about

1380
01:27:02.485 --> 01:27:06.895
that he's got time completely covered,

1381
01:27:08.525 --> 01:27:10.655
just like Isaiah four, six.

1382
01:27:16.485 --> 01:27:19.055
Then the last question, which I switched up on you all,

1383
01:27:19.555 --> 01:27:23.055
um, was, which of the topics covered this semester?

1384
01:27:23.115 --> 01:27:24.895
Do you plan to learn more about

1385
01:27:29.655 --> 01:27:30.355
the best answer?

1386
01:27:36.535 --> 01:27:40.115
Was there any specific one? If you could choose,

1387
01:27:44.695 --> 01:27:45.755
Go back to Aaron.

1388
01:27:46.015 --> 01:27:48.355
Uh, teaching Providence, just looking for

1389
01:27:48.355 --> 01:27:51.035
how God is at work in and around your life and,

1390
01:27:51.095 --> 01:27:54.475
and around your church and community and so on.

1391
01:27:55.505 --> 01:27:56.995
Looking for where he's at work

1392
01:27:57.055 --> 01:28:01.435
and being part of that, the general revelation of nature

1393
01:28:01.615 --> 01:28:05.715
and how he inspires us day by day, moment by moment

1394
01:28:06.375 --> 01:28:10.035
and through people, his creation, so on and so forth.

1395
01:28:19.455 --> 01:28:23.515
For me, it was, uh, just studying eternity and,

1396
01:28:24.455 --> 01:28:27.955
and not trying to understand that love between them all

1397
01:28:27.955 --> 01:28:29.315
and how that reflects and,

1398
01:28:30.295 --> 01:28:34.995
and that I should reflect in my life if anyone, my wife

1399
01:28:35.175 --> 01:28:36.955
or friends or whoever.

1400
01:28:37.135 --> 01:28:40.755
But then getting to write the paper on, uh,

1401
01:28:41.505 --> 01:28:43.475
made it the image of God

1402
01:28:44.975 --> 01:28:48.115
and that just became so overwhelming.

1403
01:28:49.425 --> 01:28:52.155
There's no way to, you know, it's how all

1404
01:28:52.155 --> 01:28:53.795
that relates and the whole Bible.

1405
01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:58.635
And then just, except back to that ocean analogy,

1406
01:28:59.745 --> 01:29:02.845
it's just overwhelming and how that all relates together

1407
01:29:02.905 --> 01:29:05.245
and how he created us to love others

1408
01:29:05.835 --> 01:29:07.325
because he loves his son.

1409
01:29:15.675 --> 01:29:19.245
I'll hand It back to, thank you. Thank you.

1410
01:29:23.835 --> 01:29:27.245
Alright, so, um, like we've done all along,

1411
01:29:27.855 --> 01:29:29.885
let's start archeology into doxology.

1412
01:29:30.545 --> 01:29:33.405
You stand with me and, uh, let's sing.

1413
01:29:35.275 --> 01:29:38.325
This is a song you may know. Must play it this way.

1414
01:29:38.585 --> 01:29:38.805
Oh,

1415
01:29:57.185 --> 01:29:59.005
Oh, lemme say this.

1416
01:29:59.035 --> 01:30:00.245
This is what say

1417
01:30:00.245 --> 01:30:05.025
before we say, um, I don't want

1418
01:30:05.045 --> 01:30:09.865
to take to assume we don't have time to go here,

1419
01:30:10.525 --> 01:30:14.825
but, um, the thing that makes all this relevant

1420
01:30:15.645 --> 01:30:19.865
and matter and possible is that just like we've seen,

1421
01:30:19.865 --> 01:30:21.105
there's revelation from God.

1422
01:30:21.565 --> 01:30:23.385
We understand God, we understand ourselves,

1423
01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:25.425
we know we're separated from God.

1424
01:30:25.965 --> 01:30:29.625
The only reason that we not only can draw near to God,

1425
01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:34.465
and the only reason that we want to draw near to God is

1426
01:30:34.465 --> 01:30:36.385
because Christ has come into this world

1427
01:30:36.965 --> 01:30:38.465
to save people like us.

1428
01:30:39.205 --> 01:30:42.625
And so that'll be the first thing we dive into when we come

1429
01:30:42.625 --> 01:30:43.625
back in January.

1430
01:30:44.245 --> 01:30:45.465
But we want to sing about it here,

1431
01:30:45.525 --> 01:30:46.745
the, the nature of the gospel.

1432
01:34:34.165 --> 01:34:36.785
And Almighty God, we do say hallelujah.

1433
01:34:36.815 --> 01:34:39.705
Lord, we thank you for just even this song that

1434
01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:43.865
Get the best holiday deals at now.

1435
01:34:43.865 --> 01:34:44.865
You can get.

1436
01:34:46.265 --> 01:34:48.665
Congratulations, Lord.

1437
01:34:48.665 --> 01:34:51.745
We do thank you for your goodness towards us in Christ.

1438
01:34:53.125 --> 01:34:54.425
And we have, we,

1439
01:34:55.715 --> 01:35:00.365
we've run from you in our simple nature, separated from you

1440
01:35:01.185 --> 01:35:03.845
and yet fully redeemed in Christ,

1441
01:35:05.975 --> 01:35:09.525
fully made whole and new and righteous in Christ.

1442
01:35:10.435 --> 01:35:14.765
Looking forward to only a future of joy in Christ

1443
01:35:15.225 --> 01:35:16.685
and glory for eternity.

1444
01:35:17.345 --> 01:35:20.845
The knowledge of God that we, we fill our cups with.

1445
01:35:20.905 --> 01:35:24.045
Now, Lord, we know that our, we will just continue

1446
01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:26.725
to drink from the well of living water.

1447
01:35:27.315 --> 01:35:30.205
That is your truth. That is who you are.

1448
01:35:30.305 --> 01:35:32.765
And we thank you that you invite us to this time,

1449
01:35:32.875 --> 01:35:35.485
this semester, the break we're about to have.

1450
01:35:35.645 --> 01:35:38.485
I pray that you'll seal these things in our hearts

1451
01:35:38.865 --> 01:35:41.205
and help us to continually grow in the grace

1452
01:35:41.825 --> 01:35:42.925
and the knowledge of Jesus.

1453
01:35:43.625 --> 01:35:45.205
And it's in Christ name. Amen. Pray and

1454
01:35:46.095 --> 01:35:47.095
Thank you.

1455
01:35:47.215 --> 01:35:48.215
Great.

1456
01:35:48.945 --> 01:35:53.485
You Too, mark. Mark. Appreciate you leaving. Hello?

1457
01:36:28.835 --> 01:36:29.125
Yeah.
