1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
May be seated.

2
00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:40.815
Good morning. Welcome church family. How are you today?

3
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.055
Great, great, great. It's good to see you here.

4
00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:48.495
Visitors, those of you who aren't regularly attending,

5
00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.815
our body of believers, we welcome you.

6
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:53.335
We thank you for choosing to worship with us today,

7
00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:57.935
and we ask a favor of you though we want to get to know you.

8
00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:00.455
We, we want to know who you are.

9
00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:01.975
We want to know how we might be able

10
00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:03.455
to minister and care for you.

11
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.575
We might, uh, be able to pray for you.

12
00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:07.855
If you would just share something about

13
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.175
yourself, we'd appreciate it.

14
00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:11.695
You can do that on the cards in the back

15
00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:12.695
of the seat in front of you,

16
00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:14.415
or you can do that, uh,

17
00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:18.255
through the lobby on the other side at the new here, uh,

18
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.415
centers tables where members

19
00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:24.015
of our church should warmly greet you.

20
00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:27.455
And I hope you have already been warmly greeted this morning

21
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.455
as, uh, I prepared for this sermon.

22
00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:35.215
I, I just had to think

23
00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:38.575
and give thanks to the Lord for his leadership

24
00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:41.815
and the lives of our parents, Cheryl and mine

25
00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:43.895
and in our lives

26
00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:48.375
because we cannot recall a single day

27
00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:51.655
or time that we have not been a part of the church.

28
00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:54.975
That's a massive blessing for us.

29
00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:59.455
It's an encouragement that we've received, uh,

30
00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:03.895
as our parents set that example that is meaningful to us.

31
00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:06.895
And we can recall many instances

32
00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:09.655
where our families cared for others.

33
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.835
I think about when my childhood,

34
00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:16.755
when my mother would take meals to people

35
00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:18.435
and she would help clean their homes

36
00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.195
whenever uh, they had need

37
00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:25.035
and found themselves in a difficult situation.

38
00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:27.935
I think specifically also

39
00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:31.975
of one time on a Wednesday evening when we were

40
00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:33.575
after church at the church,

41
00:02:33.595 --> 00:02:35.655
we were at Northwest Oklahoma City at the time

42
00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:38.615
and we used to spend the evenings

43
00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:41.495
after the worship in the gymnasium

44
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:43.375
with all the kids enjoying one another

45
00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:45.215
and all the dads enjoying one another

46
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:46.815
and fellowshipping playing basketball

47
00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:48.375
or dodge ball or some crazy thing.

48
00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:53.895
And my father, who I would say has quite an aversion

49
00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:57.865
to blood, was found missing.

50
00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:02.295
Instead, he had gone outside

51
00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:05.135
because he had heard that there was a motorcycle accident in

52
00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:07.575
the median, uh, outside of our church

53
00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.495
and the motorcycle accident, uh, the person

54
00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:12.295
that was involved needed care

55
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:15.855
and he brought him into the gym

56
00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.975
and through the gym into the locker room where my father

57
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.255
and a bunch of other men

58
00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:25.735
and women could take care of this man while he was awaiting

59
00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:29.775
some other more serious and needed medical care.

60
00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:36.185
I also think about Cheryl's family in the example

61
00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:40.305
that her parents give their generosity, their care

62
00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.985
for their family members, for the people in their community,

63
00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:46.585
how they provide in many ways for their church, uh, family,

64
00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:51.065
even today opening their home on a regular basis

65
00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:52.585
for their community group.

66
00:03:53.955 --> 00:03:57.375
You'll find out in a moment why that is so unusual.

67
00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:05.405
That example happened, this event happened

68
00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:07.645
for our family in January of 1995.

69
00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:11.125
Cheryl and I were in our second year of marriage.

70
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:13.765
We were sitting in our apartment still water.

71
00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:16.845
I'm certain that we were studying, trying

72
00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:19.805
to finish our degree, but as we were there,

73
00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:22.045
we received a phone call that evening

74
00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:26.045
and the phone call was a somber, immediate,

75
00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:27.685
urgent phone call.

76
00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:32.645
Cheryl's father and brother had been in a serious

77
00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:35.285
one vehicle rollover accident,

78
00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:38.525
and Cheryl's father had been critically injured

79
00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:41.085
and was being life flighted to Oklahoma City

80
00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:44.485
to be at Baptist Medical Center in the emergency room.

81
00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:49.415
So we got in the car and we rushed to Oklahoma City

82
00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:52.255
to meet him there and Cheryl's mom,

83
00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:55.175
and that's when we found out that Sheryl's father

84
00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:58.855
had been paralyzed from the neck down.

85
00:05:00.645 --> 00:05:02.735
He'd be a quadriplegic for the rest of his life.

86
00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:05.295
He would require significant treatment, rehab,

87
00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:08.495
and all of the things that go along with that.

88
00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:12.565
Travel from Oklahoma City to Dallas

89
00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:15.645
and later to Tulsa and then back home.

90
00:05:17.905 --> 00:05:21.045
During that time though, we got

91
00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:25.885
to once again witness the church being the church

92
00:05:26.715 --> 00:05:29.405
because they were now caring

93
00:05:30.105 --> 00:05:32.005
for our family.

94
00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:36.095
The church that Cheryl's parents belonged

95
00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:38.295
to were the same church that my parents had belonged

96
00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:39.335
to that we had met in.

97
00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:41.375
And these people recognized at this point

98
00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:46.515
that life would never be the same for Roger and Judy

99
00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:50.075
and Alan and Shelly and Cheryl and our families.

100
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:54.095
The church provided meals for a very long time

101
00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:55.655
after the accident.

102
00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:57.965
Of course that's a a pretty common

103
00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.125
thing that we do as Baptist.

104
00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:03.365
We feel like fellowship is uh, spelled FOOD

105
00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:07.005
and it is in many cases, so don't stop that, right?

106
00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:11.885
But at the same time, what they recognized in knowing that,

107
00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:15.405
uh, life would not be the same, they recognize

108
00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:19.165
that the house that Roger and Judy lived in

109
00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:23.605
and still live in to this day was insufficient

110
00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:28.045
to bring a quadriplegic into the house

111
00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:30.205
and be able to care for them.

112
00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:33.085
So they involved themselves

113
00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:36.485
and engaged in a pretty significant remodel of the house,

114
00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:38.845
taking a very large front bedroom

115
00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:43.725
and converting that front bedroom into a rehab care room

116
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.005
with a handicap accessible bathroom attached

117
00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:50.525
that you could pull a wheelchair into and bathe and care

118
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.645
and brush teeth and all of the things that would need

119
00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:55.285
to to be done.

120
00:06:58.105 --> 00:07:01.815
It was amazing. It was such a great example

121
00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:06.215
of actions of love that were unprovoked

122
00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:10.215
and genuine toward Roger

123
00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:12.975
and Judy, Alan, Shelly, and our family.

124
00:07:15.065 --> 00:07:16.555
This is just an example of

125
00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:18.875
what we're gonna talk about today in verses 10

126
00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:20.955
and 15 of Romans 12.

127
00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:26.355
As we do though, we need to more fully appreciate what it is

128
00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:29.395
that Paul is teaching and exhorting the Romans.

129
00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:34.035
So we're gonna start by reading all of Romans 12, one

130
00:07:34.035 --> 00:07:36.955
through 15 as we do.

131
00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:40.875
If you are able to stand, please do so in honor

132
00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:42.555
of the reading of God's word.

133
00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:51.075
Romans 12 verse one.

134
00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:55.435
I appeal to you, therefore brothers, by the mercies of God

135
00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:58.875
to prevent, present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

136
00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:03.635
holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

137
00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:07.915
Do not be conformed to this world,

138
00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:12.315
but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that

139
00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:15.635
by testing you may discern what is the will of God,

140
00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:18.995
what is good and acceptable

141
00:08:19.135 --> 00:08:23.555
and perfect for by the grace given to me, I say

142
00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:25.235
to everyone among you not to think

143
00:08:25.235 --> 00:08:28.315
of himself more highly than he ought to think,

144
00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:32.155
but to think with sober judgment, each according

145
00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:34.755
to the measures or to the measure of faith

146
00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:37.915
that God has assigned for us in one body,

147
00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:40.915
we have many members and the members do not all

148
00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:42.115
have the same function.

149
00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:46.835
So we though many are one body in Christ

150
00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:51.755
and individually members one of another, having gifts

151
00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:54.155
that differ according to the grace given to us.

152
00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:58.165
Let us use them if prophecy and proportion to our faith.

153
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:01.845
If service in our serving, the one

154
00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:04.925
who teaches in his teaching, the one

155
00:09:04.925 --> 00:09:08.085
who exhorts in his exhortation, the one

156
00:09:08.145 --> 00:09:12.845
who contin contributes in generosity, the one who leads

157
00:09:12.965 --> 00:09:16.845
with zeal, the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness.

158
00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:22.925
Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil.

159
00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:24.925
Hold fast to what is good.

160
00:09:25.835 --> 00:09:28.245
Love one another with brotherly affection.

161
00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:31.205
Outdo one another in showing honor.

162
00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:35.695
Do not be thoughtful and zeal. Be fervent in spirit.

163
00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:39.695
Serve the Lord, rejoice in hope.

164
00:09:39.835 --> 00:09:43.855
Be patient in tribulation. Be constant in prayer.

165
00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:47.535
Contribute to the needs of the saints

166
00:09:47.595 --> 00:09:49.575
and seek to show hospitality.

167
00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:54.775
Bless those who persecute you. Bless and do not curse them.

168
00:09:56.015 --> 00:10:00.815
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.

169
00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:04.485
That's Romans 12, one through 15. Thank you.

170
00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:05.325
You may be seated

171
00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:12.645
Today we'll focus on loving one another in the first half

172
00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:16.205
of verse 10 and caring for others around us in verse 15,

173
00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:17.725
both rejoicing and weeping.

174
00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:22.045
But first, before we do as we need to really understand

175
00:10:22.105 --> 00:10:26.445
and appreciate this particular instruction by Paul, we need

176
00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:28.365
to review some important fundamentals.

177
00:10:29.055 --> 00:10:32.645
Those fundamentals start in verse two for us today

178
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.685
where we see that our love for one another

179
00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:40.205
and others is a transformed love.

180
00:10:42.565 --> 00:10:46.955
Verse two tells us, do not be conformed to this world.

181
00:10:48.585 --> 00:10:51.275
This English word conformed is translated

182
00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:54.355
from a Greek word system Zo.

183
00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:57.515
Okay? True confessions here.

184
00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:00.355
I am not a Greek scholar.

185
00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:05.795
There may be some of you here today who are, if you are

186
00:11:06.455 --> 00:11:10.275
and I pronounce something incorrectly, please just giggle

187
00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:12.595
and give me the grace to move on.

188
00:11:14.615 --> 00:11:19.515
But Cisco matzo is a word that can be defined as to form

189
00:11:19.695 --> 00:11:23.315
or mold one's behavior in accordance with

190
00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:25.435
a particular pattern

191
00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:28.115
or set of standards to shape one's behavior

192
00:11:28.615 --> 00:11:30.355
to conform one's life.

193
00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:36.525
The image I get here is an image of being

194
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:41.685
pressed into the world, into this mold.

195
00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:46.925
When I was a consultant, I used to consult

196
00:11:46.925 --> 00:11:49.085
with manufacturing companies around our state

197
00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:52.365
and the surrounding states, and I got the benefit

198
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.805
and the privilege of, uh, consulting

199
00:11:54.805 --> 00:11:56.525
with many household names

200
00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:58.165
that you would know and understand.

201
00:11:58.745 --> 00:12:03.045
But one of them that you probably wouldn't recognize is one

202
00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:06.445
that I think is particularly interesting in light

203
00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:08.045
of this instruction.

204
00:12:09.075 --> 00:12:12.925
It's a little company in Miami, Oklahoma that

205
00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:17.685
made its claim to fame in World War II by manufacturing

206
00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:21.965
what we know as the jerry can, a metal gas can

207
00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:25.245
that was used to carry fuel around the countryside

208
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:29.445
and the back of Jeeps and other vehicles to allow us to, uh,

209
00:12:29.975 --> 00:12:33.485
power these vehicles throughout the battlefields.

210
00:12:34.895 --> 00:12:39.635
But they had con uh, transformed their manufacturing process

211
00:12:39.975 --> 00:12:42.515
for manufacturing in metal products

212
00:12:42.515 --> 00:12:47.315
to manufacturing in plastic products that we now use today.

213
00:12:49.175 --> 00:12:52.995
So their key product were plastic gas cans.

214
00:12:53.935 --> 00:12:58.315
And as they had con uh, changed their manufacturing process,

215
00:12:59.065 --> 00:13:02.315
they had now used what's known as extrusion molding

216
00:13:03.535 --> 00:13:04.875
and extrusion molding.

217
00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:09.195
What it di is is they have these big gigantic bins

218
00:13:09.195 --> 00:13:11.955
of plastic pellets that are different colors.

219
00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:14.715
Some of them white, some of them red, some of them blue

220
00:13:15.135 --> 00:13:16.235
for different purposes,

221
00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.835
and they feed those into a vacuum system

222
00:13:18.895 --> 00:13:20.915
and bring them into a heating apparatus.

223
00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:24.155
And that heating apparatus puts them in a consistency

224
00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:28.395
that is able to extrude a tube out

225
00:13:28.395 --> 00:13:32.875
of the ceiling, basically to come into a series

226
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.715
of molds that clamp down.

227
00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:36.435
And as the tube comes in

228
00:13:36.455 --> 00:13:39.435
and the molds clamp around, air is blown in

229
00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:41.595
and the um, those pellets

230
00:13:41.595 --> 00:13:46.155
that were melted now form into the side of the molds.

231
00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:50.275
So when they pull the molds away, there is a gas can.

232
00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:53.675
But when they pull the molds away and we saw

233
00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:55.195
and I saw those gas cans,

234
00:13:55.425 --> 00:13:58.635
what I also recognized was there was an edge

235
00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:03.675
around the gas can of excess materials in every

236
00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:08.815
instance and example in their particular process,

237
00:14:09.445 --> 00:14:14.415
they would try desperately to reuse and recycle that excess,

238
00:14:15.315 --> 00:14:18.055
but oftentimes they would just have to cut it away

239
00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:20.015
and discard it.

240
00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:25.275
That's an important picture for me

241
00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:29.555
because as I think about those verses between verse two

242
00:14:29.615 --> 00:14:32.195
and verse nine where we're encouraged

243
00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:35.195
and exhorted to use our gifts to unify

244
00:14:35.255 --> 00:14:37.315
and bind the body of believers,

245
00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:40.195
and I think about where Paul is telling us not

246
00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:42.435
to be conformed to this world,

247
00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:45.315
what I think about is I think about

248
00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:47.675
that gas can coming out with the excess.

249
00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.405
If we are conformed

250
00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:52.925
and pressed into this world,

251
00:14:53.315 --> 00:14:56.765
what happens is we're pressed into a mold we were not

252
00:14:57.085 --> 00:14:59.125
intended to be formed into,

253
00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:03.445
and there is always excess that comes around the edges.

254
00:15:04.485 --> 00:15:08.185
And the excess that we have that is carved away by the world

255
00:15:08.185 --> 00:15:12.305
as not useful as unmeaningful, as even

256
00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:17.795
weakness is that we have is discarded.

257
00:15:20.165 --> 00:15:25.085
And that discard happens to be many of the gifts, many

258
00:15:25.085 --> 00:15:29.885
of the the equipping ways that God has designed us

259
00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:34.765
to serve and minister to our body of believers

260
00:15:34.785 --> 00:15:36.965
and those people that we live around.

261
00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:43.865
If we allow ourselves to be conformed to the world

262
00:15:43.865 --> 00:15:47.145
around us, we cannot fulfill the design that God has for us.

263
00:15:47.925 --> 00:15:51.545
We will come out looking like something entirely different

264
00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:53.745
than what we were intended to look like

265
00:15:54.165 --> 00:15:57.625
and we will lack the full substance of

266
00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.945
what God intended for us to have.

267
00:16:03.805 --> 00:16:07.465
But instead, Paul goes on in verse two to tell us to

268
00:16:08.045 --> 00:16:10.065
be transformed.

269
00:16:13.635 --> 00:16:15.495
As John shared several weeks ago,

270
00:16:15.515 --> 00:16:18.295
the English word transformed is translated from a Greek

271
00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:19.935
word metamorpho O.

272
00:16:21.285 --> 00:16:25.175
This word can be defined as the change, uh,

273
00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:28.255
to change the essential form or nature of something.

274
00:16:28.325 --> 00:16:30.055
It's the the same word

275
00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:33.375
that we derive our word metamorphosis from

276
00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:39.135
Contrast, this change to being conformed

277
00:16:41.305 --> 00:16:44.285
in that instance, that example of being conformed,

278
00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:46.045
particularly in the context

279
00:16:46.265 --> 00:16:49.205
of those plastic beads being put into a gap,

280
00:16:49.205 --> 00:16:50.325
made into a gas can.

281
00:16:52.425 --> 00:16:55.995
What we see is their real makeup hasn't really changed.

282
00:16:55.995 --> 00:17:00.235
They're still plastic. They're kind of joined together

283
00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:03.035
with other plastic to make these gas cans,

284
00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:04.795
but they're still plastic.

285
00:17:05.545 --> 00:17:08.235
They're just in a different form, okay?

286
00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:11.295
They look a little bit different,

287
00:17:12.395 --> 00:17:16.695
but if we're transformed, we will be different.

288
00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:22.985
What's interesting here is that earlier in this letter

289
00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:26.545
to the Romans, Paul in verse 29 of chapter eight

290
00:17:27.265 --> 00:17:30.745
actually instructs the Roman believers to be conformed.

291
00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:34.665
But in this point he doesn't just instruct them

292
00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:36.665
to be conformed, he instructs him

293
00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:39.905
to be conformed into the image of Jesus,

294
00:17:40.655 --> 00:17:42.745
into the likeness of him.

295
00:17:45.295 --> 00:17:47.195
So we're not to be conformed to this world,

296
00:17:47.215 --> 00:17:49.035
but we are to be transformed or

297
00:17:49.185 --> 00:17:52.605
or changed, were to be conformed into the image of the sun.

298
00:17:54.735 --> 00:17:57.555
In this case conformed in verse 29

299
00:17:57.555 --> 00:17:59.355
or chapter eight is not

300
00:18:00.365 --> 00:18:03.045
matzo, it's a different word.

301
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:07.685
Amorphous is the word in Greek is translated here

302
00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:10.445
and this word means pertaining to

303
00:18:10.445 --> 00:18:13.045
that which has a similar form or nature.

304
00:18:15.535 --> 00:18:16.665
Does that sound familiar?

305
00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:22.235
It reminds me of Genesis chapter one verses 26

306
00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:26.515
and 27 where we're told that then God said,

307
00:18:26.655 --> 00:18:30.235
let us make man in our image after our likeness

308
00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:34.035
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea

309
00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:36.675
and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock

310
00:18:36.695 --> 00:18:38.355
and over all the earth

311
00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:40.835
and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.

312
00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:45.595
So God created man in his image, in the image of God,

313
00:18:45.615 --> 00:18:48.795
he created him, male and female, he created them.

314
00:18:49.345 --> 00:18:51.555
Genesis 1 26 and 27.

315
00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:55.435
It is in God's image then that we were

316
00:18:55.815 --> 00:18:57.195
and are created.

317
00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:02.395
But unfortunately, sin has marred that image.

318
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:05.895
It's unrecognizable.

319
00:19:06.155 --> 00:19:10.945
In fact, our allowing ourselves

320
00:19:11.005 --> 00:19:13.745
to be conformed to this world continues

321
00:19:13.805 --> 00:19:16.585
to make his image unrecognizable.

322
00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:19.465
William Hendrickson

323
00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:23.665
and his commentary on Romans actually translates this verse

324
00:19:23.885 --> 00:19:28.465
as stop allowing yourselves to be conformed

325
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:33.625
to this world when we're allowing

326
00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:35.265
ourselves to be conformed.

327
00:19:36.895 --> 00:19:40.355
We are not who it is that God intended us to be.

328
00:19:40.415 --> 00:19:41.715
We need to be transformed.

329
00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:42.835
We need to be changed,

330
00:19:43.895 --> 00:19:48.795
and it's into God's image that we need to changed.

331
00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:53.995
There's not one there of us that has ever perfectly

332
00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:57.995
exemplified this, but there is one who has

333
00:19:59.655 --> 00:20:02.555
and that one who has is in fact

334
00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:06.915
and indeed if I can get it out of my pocket, the

335
00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:13.155
plumb line that John's been talking about, it's Jesus,

336
00:20:15.555 --> 00:20:18.525
that straight plumb line example.

337
00:20:20.395 --> 00:20:21.895
So as we look at these verses

338
00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:25.775
and we think about what it is we are to

339
00:20:27.785 --> 00:20:30.555
exemplify to the world, we need to think

340
00:20:30.575 --> 00:20:34.875
and look at it in terms of who Jesus was, who Jesus is,

341
00:20:36.955 --> 00:20:41.815
and our transformed love should be first for one another.

342
00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:44.945
That's what Paul tells us in verse 10,

343
00:20:47.465 --> 00:20:49.315
Paul instructs the Roman of believers here

344
00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:51.755
to love one another with brotherly affection.

345
00:20:52.265 --> 00:20:55.035
This love is not the same love as in verse nine.

346
00:20:55.035 --> 00:20:59.915
Verse nine is agape love this enduring, everlasting,

347
00:21:01.005 --> 00:21:02.275
undeserved love.

348
00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:06.475
In this case, this is a brotherly love,

349
00:21:06.635 --> 00:21:07.755
a love for one another.

350
00:21:11.495 --> 00:21:15.715
And in verse 10, he uses this Greek word philoso ghost

351
00:21:15.785 --> 00:21:18.355
that can be translated pertaining to love

352
00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:22.435
or affection for those closely related to one, particularly

353
00:21:23.085 --> 00:21:24.475
one's immediate family.

354
00:21:27.335 --> 00:21:30.185
Paul telling the Roman believers to love one another,

355
00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:34.205
one another, like they love their own family.

356
00:21:36.955 --> 00:21:38.895
How is it that we love our family?

357
00:21:42.145 --> 00:21:44.565
Can you guys imagine that you guys see

358
00:21:44.565 --> 00:21:46.045
that picture in your mind right now?

359
00:21:48.965 --> 00:21:50.465
How does that compare to

360
00:21:50.605 --> 00:21:53.625
how we love one another within this family

361
00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.825
of believers within this body?

362
00:21:57.975 --> 00:22:00.655
I see it and I observe it on a regular basis.

363
00:22:01.895 --> 00:22:04.655
I know of needs and situations that our body

364
00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:08.815
of believers absolutely treats one another like family

365
00:22:08.815 --> 00:22:11.605
members, but it's something we need

366
00:22:11.605 --> 00:22:14.325
to ask ourselves on a daily basis if our love

367
00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:16.885
for the church is different than our love for the family.

368
00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:19.885
Are we loving toward one another?

369
00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:23.685
Are we warmly devoted to one another?

370
00:22:25.285 --> 00:22:30.155
Affectionate? Do we

371
00:22:30.185 --> 00:22:33.435
show resilient, caring, love in good times and bad?

372
00:22:36.795 --> 00:22:39.555
Consider this in light of verse nine that also Paul says,

373
00:22:39.735 --> 00:22:41.155
let love be genuine.

374
00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:46.995
This word genuine is translated from altos.

375
00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:51.675
That word means pertaining to being genuine and sincere

376
00:22:52.895 --> 00:22:57.075
and hence lacking in pretense or show.

377
00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:02.475
Paul's telling us that our love should be without hypocrisy.

378
00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:06.595
In other words, our words of saying, I love you brother,

379
00:23:06.795 --> 00:23:09.835
I love you, sister, our words of telling someone

380
00:23:09.835 --> 00:23:12.115
that we care for them should actually be followed

381
00:23:12.385 --> 00:23:16.875
with action and our actions

382
00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:18.835
should mimic those words.

383
00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:24.335
How we greet one another, how we support one another,

384
00:23:24.755 --> 00:23:28.855
how we enjoy one another, and how we care for one another.

385
00:23:31.805 --> 00:23:33.555
Think about some examples with me.

386
00:23:36.285 --> 00:23:39.985
We, uh, as elders when we meet on Tuesday nights,

387
00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:42.825
we spend a few minutes at the beginning of our meetings

388
00:23:43.325 --> 00:23:45.410
and uh, those minutes are in devotion.

389
00:23:46.025 --> 00:23:48.605
And most recently crisscross has been leading us

390
00:23:48.605 --> 00:23:50.565
through Exodus chapter 34,

391
00:23:51.385 --> 00:23:54.445
and we've been talking about the character traits of God

392
00:23:54.445 --> 00:23:57.245
that are displayed to us in Exodus 34 6.

393
00:23:58.865 --> 00:24:00.925
The character trait we talked about this past Tuesday

394
00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:04.005
as we met was that God shows

395
00:24:05.035 --> 00:24:06.365
steadfast love.

396
00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:10.155
And in verse seven, we find

397
00:24:10.155 --> 00:24:14.035
that steadfast love is manifest toward us in forgiveness.

398
00:24:16.535 --> 00:24:21.475
So do we manifest steadfast love, forgiveness to those

399
00:24:22.055 --> 00:24:26.615
in our body of believers exemplifying what God has showed

400
00:24:26.675 --> 00:24:31.045
to us following the image that we were created in.

401
00:24:33.575 --> 00:24:37.795
Think about Matthew chapter 12 verses 46 through 50

402
00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:42.075
record where Jesus was approached by a man who's saying

403
00:24:42.075 --> 00:24:44.555
that your mother and your brothers wanna speak with you.

404
00:24:45.415 --> 00:24:49.595
And Jesus' response to them, this man was who are my mother

405
00:24:49.815 --> 00:24:52.875
and my brothers aren't my mother

406
00:24:52.975 --> 00:24:56.235
and my brothers, those who do the will of my father,

407
00:24:59.325 --> 00:25:02.755
those who do the will of my father, believers the church.

408
00:25:03.305 --> 00:25:06.835
This is the same people that Paul is calling one another

409
00:25:07.415 --> 00:25:09.115
in this passage in Romans 12,

410
00:25:12.875 --> 00:25:16.305
Jesus also shared times of joy and rest with his disciples.

411
00:25:17.085 --> 00:25:18.905
We find this in Mark chapter six

412
00:25:18.925 --> 00:25:20.025
and Luke chapter 10,

413
00:25:20.155 --> 00:25:23.945
where Jesus had sent out the 72 disciples two by two.

414
00:25:24.965 --> 00:25:26.945
He gave them specific instruction

415
00:25:26.965 --> 00:25:28.945
and guidance on what they were to do

416
00:25:29.085 --> 00:25:31.505
and how they were to do it, even how they were

417
00:25:31.525 --> 00:25:35.065
to respond when they were not welcomed at a different place.

418
00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:41.115
And as they returned telling Jesus of what the result

419
00:25:41.115 --> 00:25:45.355
of their proclaiming, repentance and casting out demons

420
00:25:45.855 --> 00:25:50.675
and healing, many was Jesus rejoiced

421
00:25:50.865 --> 00:25:54.875
with them and called them to a time of rest.

422
00:25:58.255 --> 00:26:02.315
We also see in the last supper a time of rest

423
00:26:02.495 --> 00:26:05.395
and joy that Jesus had with his disciples

424
00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:09.195
where he called them before what he knew would be

425
00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:13.035
his last days on earth before his ascension,

426
00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:16.395
before his death and burial and mistreatment

427
00:26:16.455 --> 00:26:21.175
and hatred that all showed him we're told of

428
00:26:21.175 --> 00:26:22.855
how he spent this time of solitude

429
00:26:22.855 --> 00:26:24.375
with them enjoying their company

430
00:26:24.395 --> 00:26:25.815
and fellowship in the upper room.

431
00:26:28.005 --> 00:26:30.905
And then we're told in Acts chapter two verses 42

432
00:26:30.905 --> 00:26:34.465
through 47, how the early church mimicked

433
00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:37.185
and mirrored exactly the example of

434
00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:41.145
what Jesus had showed them we're told in Acts two,

435
00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:44.645
and they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching

436
00:26:44.705 --> 00:26:48.365
and the fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers

437
00:26:49.915 --> 00:26:52.815
and all came upon every soul and many wonders

438
00:26:52.815 --> 00:26:55.495
and signs were being done through the apostles

439
00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:57.935
and all who believe were together

440
00:26:58.155 --> 00:27:00.095
and had all things in common,

441
00:27:01.115 --> 00:27:03.735
and they were selling their possessions and belongings

442
00:27:03.735 --> 00:27:07.255
and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need.

443
00:27:08.275 --> 00:27:10.535
And day by day, attending the temple together

444
00:27:10.555 --> 00:27:13.215
and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food

445
00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:16.055
with glad and generous hearts, praising God

446
00:27:16.075 --> 00:27:17.695
and having favor with all the people

447
00:27:18.515 --> 00:27:20.935
and the Lord added to their number day

448
00:27:20.995 --> 00:27:23.255
by day those who are being saved.

449
00:27:25.535 --> 00:27:29.085
These passages give us some examples of

450
00:27:29.085 --> 00:27:31.085
what brotherly affection is.

451
00:27:32.555 --> 00:27:35.525
It's caring for one another that is steadfast,

452
00:27:35.795 --> 00:27:39.645
meaning not wavering, regardless of good times or bad.

453
00:27:40.795 --> 00:27:43.445
It's love for whoever does the will,

454
00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:46.005
the father's will for one another.

455
00:27:47.595 --> 00:27:50.245
It's a love that acts in obedience to Jesus

456
00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:53.165
and celebrates what the Lord accomplishes

457
00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:54.845
through that obedience.

458
00:27:55.515 --> 00:27:59.195
It's a love that enjoys times of peace together,

459
00:28:00.465 --> 00:28:02.035
despite times of trouble

460
00:28:02.815 --> 00:28:06.155
and trials that we are confident will come.

461
00:28:09.175 --> 00:28:14.095
It's a love that is devoted implying commitment

462
00:28:14.095 --> 00:28:18.085
and sacrifice, working to together to understand

463
00:28:18.145 --> 00:28:22.445
and rightly divide the scriptures, sharing the blessings

464
00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:25.405
and benefits of being a unified body of believers,

465
00:28:26.275 --> 00:28:30.725
sharing all things to ensure provision for each member

466
00:28:30.725 --> 00:28:35.325
of the body daily, engaging in worship and fellowship

467
00:28:35.985 --> 00:28:39.255
and faith, having glad hearts

468
00:28:39.765 --> 00:28:44.235
overflowing in generosity, praising God

469
00:28:45.055 --> 00:28:47.275
and having favor with all the people.

470
00:28:49.575 --> 00:28:52.825
It's this point, having favor with all the people

471
00:28:53.175 --> 00:28:54.385
that is the result

472
00:28:54.525 --> 00:28:56.905
and benefit of showing love

473
00:28:58.045 --> 00:29:03.045
for others

474
00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:06.045
We're called the deep sacrificial love

475
00:29:07.025 --> 00:29:09.765
as we're being reshaped, transformed

476
00:29:09.825 --> 00:29:13.285
and conformed into his likeness, his nature, his image,

477
00:29:13.705 --> 00:29:17.525
our transformation results in a different kind of love.

478
00:29:18.065 --> 00:29:21.485
Not one that is meant by the world, where the world means it

479
00:29:21.485 --> 00:29:25.365
to be some emotional connection, but a real

480
00:29:25.625 --> 00:29:29.405
and true connection to one another where we genuinely care

481
00:29:29.915 --> 00:29:32.205
it's different kind of love than

482
00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:33.885
what we see displayed in the world.

483
00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:39.535
Jesus rejoiced and wept with his disciples for sure,

484
00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:43.405
but also rejoiced and wept with others.

485
00:29:44.495 --> 00:29:46.285
Let's take a look at some examples.

486
00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:48.445
As Jesus rejoiced with others,

487
00:29:52.145 --> 00:29:53.555
Paul starts in verse 15

488
00:29:53.615 --> 00:29:55.955
and tells us to rejoice with those who rejoice.

489
00:29:57.235 --> 00:29:59.965
This word rejoice is translated from a Greek word,

490
00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:01.765
uh, called Cairo.

491
00:30:03.455 --> 00:30:06.445
Cairo means to enjoy a state of happiness and wellbeing,

492
00:30:07.345 --> 00:30:11.445
and it has implicit in it, not just those times

493
00:30:11.745 --> 00:30:14.605
of significant greatness and benefit,

494
00:30:15.895 --> 00:30:18.675
but times of just mere peace

495
00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:22.155
and lack of turmoil to enjoy with one another.

496
00:30:23.815 --> 00:30:27.085
Jesus did this with others who were not as disciples.

497
00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:32.765
Remember the wedding feast at Cana in John chapter two

498
00:30:32.765 --> 00:30:34.805
where Jesus was celebrating with all those

499
00:30:35.225 --> 00:30:37.765
who were at the wedding and performed

500
00:30:37.765 --> 00:30:40.605
what we now know is his first recorded miracle.

501
00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:45.285
How about the private teaching in

502
00:30:45.285 --> 00:30:46.765
parables that Jesus shared?

503
00:30:48.675 --> 00:30:52.445
Imagine sitting on our patio with our neighbors,

504
00:30:52.445 --> 00:30:55.685
telling stories of our lives what God has done in us

505
00:30:55.685 --> 00:30:57.685
and what we know to be true about him.

506
00:30:58.585 --> 00:30:59.845
That's what I envision.

507
00:31:01.285 --> 00:31:02.795
There would've been disciples

508
00:31:02.895 --> 00:31:05.635
and not disciples alike that were there.

509
00:31:05.695 --> 00:31:07.835
We know those people that weren't disciples were there

510
00:31:07.835 --> 00:31:10.715
because Jesus in those moments was criticized

511
00:31:10.775 --> 00:31:14.555
and he was chastised for teaching in the way he was teaching

512
00:31:14.575 --> 00:31:17.075
and teaching what he was teaching, even teaching

513
00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:22.035
with authority as he were God and he is.

514
00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:27.705
Remember Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners.

515
00:31:29.885 --> 00:31:32.675
Jesus dying with Matthew at his house, a tax collector

516
00:31:32.675 --> 00:31:34.635
with many other tax collectors as well,

517
00:31:35.095 --> 00:31:37.195
and what the people called sinners.

518
00:31:39.305 --> 00:31:42.915
When the Pharisees questioned Jesus about it, Jesus said,

519
00:31:43.295 --> 00:31:46.915
it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.

520
00:31:47.235 --> 00:31:50.355
I have not come to call the righteous but sinners.

521
00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:57.365
And we should also recall when Jesus came into Zia's house,

522
00:31:58.115 --> 00:31:59.445
invited himself there,

523
00:32:01.115 --> 00:32:04.335
and that was the moment where that interaction with Jesus

524
00:32:05.855 --> 00:32:08.105
that resulted in Zacchaeus repentance,

525
00:32:10.525 --> 00:32:14.825
loving Christ, should overflow into rejoicing

526
00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:18.705
with other people, genuine times of happiness and wellbeing.

527
00:32:20.335 --> 00:32:25.135
Like though Jesus wept with others.

528
00:32:29.095 --> 00:32:31.905
Paul tells us in the second half of verse 15 that we're

529
00:32:31.905 --> 00:32:33.265
to weep with those who weep

530
00:32:34.665 --> 00:32:37.925
To weep is translated from a Greek word called cla.

531
00:32:39.715 --> 00:32:43.725
Clio means, uh, to weep with the clear implication

532
00:32:43.865 --> 00:32:45.125
of shedding tears.

533
00:32:47.035 --> 00:32:49.725
Deep sorrow is what we would think.

534
00:32:51.995 --> 00:32:55.855
And examples of Jesus' life exist here too, where Jesus

535
00:32:56.365 --> 00:32:57.575
wept with others.

536
00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:03.015
First John 11, where Jesus wept because of Lazarus's death.

537
00:33:04.505 --> 00:33:06.685
He didn't need to weep. Think about this.

538
00:33:07.575 --> 00:33:09.565
Jesus knew what the outcome would be.

539
00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:12.245
Jesus was going to perform it himself.

540
00:33:12.535 --> 00:33:15.365
Jesus waited so that he could perform it,

541
00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:18.885
but yet he still entered into their sorrow.

542
00:33:19.345 --> 00:33:22.165
He still entered into their weeping at that time

543
00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:25.005
with Mary and Martha

544
00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:27.885
and all of the others that mourned Lazarus death.

545
00:33:30.405 --> 00:33:33.265
And Luke chapter 22, we see this moment

546
00:33:34.405 --> 00:33:38.905
and Jesus trials where Jesus looks up from the trials

547
00:33:39.245 --> 00:33:43.105
and catches Peter's eye the moment

548
00:33:43.115 --> 00:33:45.265
after he's indeed

549
00:33:46.085 --> 00:33:48.305
denied Christ for the third time.

550
00:33:50.245 --> 00:33:53.465
And we're told of Peter's sorrow in that

551
00:33:54.085 --> 00:33:57.305
his embarrassment, his guilt that he felt,

552
00:33:57.645 --> 00:34:01.825
but I'm certain that Jesus likewise felt the sorrow

553
00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:06.105
and the pain in the similar way that Peter did.

554
00:34:08.495 --> 00:34:11.235
And finally we see in Matthew chapter 23,

555
00:34:11.235 --> 00:34:12.795
where Jesus wept over Jerusalem

556
00:34:12.865 --> 00:34:16.195
because he knew that Jerusalem would not believe

557
00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:19.955
and that they would have a coming judgment.

558
00:34:25.145 --> 00:34:27.235
Okay, I have an apology to give you

559
00:34:27.895 --> 00:34:30.835
at the beginning when I brought you into, uh, this,

560
00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:32.675
uh, study together.

561
00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:38.035
I left you in 1995, middle schoolers. That means 1995.

562
00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:41.275
There was no, uh, smartphone.

563
00:34:41.405 --> 00:34:43.275
There was no Minecraft,

564
00:34:43.455 --> 00:34:46.635
and there was, you know, no Netflix, certainly no Netflix.

565
00:34:46.995 --> 00:34:48.155
I apologize for leaving you there,

566
00:34:48.575 --> 00:34:50.315
but I want you to fast forward for a minute

567
00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:51.955
to January of 2021.

568
00:34:53.775 --> 00:34:57.715
In January of 2021, I was at work one afternoon

569
00:34:59.335 --> 00:35:02.975
and my father called, that was not something

570
00:35:03.005 --> 00:35:05.615
that was a typical usual event.

571
00:35:05.795 --> 00:35:09.775
He, he was kind and has always been kind to honor my workday

572
00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.855
and, uh, not interrupt.

573
00:35:11.955 --> 00:35:15.495
So I knew when he called, it was something that was, uh,

574
00:35:15.495 --> 00:35:18.095
serious and, and needed my attention

575
00:35:19.555 --> 00:35:20.695
as I answered the phone.

576
00:35:21.355 --> 00:35:23.015
He explained that he

577
00:35:23.015 --> 00:35:26.055
and my mom had been to the doctor to get their first

578
00:35:26.195 --> 00:35:27.535
of the COVID vaccinations.

579
00:35:28.035 --> 00:35:31.375
And afterward they had gone to lunch and stopped

580
00:35:31.515 --> 00:35:32.735
and enjoyed a bit of time.

581
00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:35.855
And at lunch, my mother had had a

582
00:35:36.565 --> 00:35:38.645
significant medical event.

583
00:35:40.275 --> 00:35:41.885
Something we would later learn

584
00:35:42.545 --> 00:35:45.125
was a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

585
00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:51.045
She was admitted to care at OU Medical Center,

586
00:35:51.945 --> 00:35:55.375
but due to COVID restrictions, she was alone

587
00:35:57.195 --> 00:36:01.175
for weeks, her surgeries,

588
00:36:02.195 --> 00:36:04.455
her recovery and therapy

589
00:36:05.525 --> 00:36:08.015
with no family member by her side.

590
00:36:11.525 --> 00:36:15.575
Once again, it was during that time

591
00:36:16.525 --> 00:36:20.375
that our family saw the church

592
00:36:21.165 --> 00:36:23.815
respond and react with the love of Jesus.

593
00:36:26.085 --> 00:36:27.705
We have members in our church body

594
00:36:28.125 --> 00:36:29.185
who didn't know my parents.

595
00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:36.555
They were generous to help translate the diagnosis,

596
00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:40.835
to help explain the treatments, to help tell us

597
00:36:40.995 --> 00:36:43.915
of the risks, to check on us

598
00:36:44.095 --> 00:36:45.995
and my father to provide meals

599
00:36:46.215 --> 00:36:49.555
and most importantly to me, to visit my mother

600
00:36:50.295 --> 00:36:54.675
during their workday at OU Medical Center facilities.

601
00:36:58.485 --> 00:37:02.025
We had tangibly received again,

602
00:37:02.725 --> 00:37:03.785
the unprovoked

603
00:37:04.165 --> 00:37:08.465
and genuine love of Christ through the church.

604
00:37:11.555 --> 00:37:12.895
And my parents are believers.

605
00:37:14.875 --> 00:37:17.055
So it might seem kind of weird

606
00:37:17.055 --> 00:37:20.375
that I'm fitting this into a time when we're learning

607
00:37:20.435 --> 00:37:23.815
and teaching about loving others who aren't a part

608
00:37:23.815 --> 00:37:24.815
of the believing body.

609
00:37:25.115 --> 00:37:26.295
But let me tell you something,

610
00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:30.015
those church members at Henderson Hills that cared for us

611
00:37:30.015 --> 00:37:34.215
during this time period, I never once

612
00:37:35.355 --> 00:37:39.055
recall that they asked if my parents were believers.

613
00:37:41.075 --> 00:37:44.925
They just acted. They just loved.

614
00:37:45.915 --> 00:37:47.525
They just cared.

615
00:37:51.195 --> 00:37:54.885
They were simply displaying the love of Jesus to others,

616
00:37:55.635 --> 00:37:59.285
helping make sense of medical facts that neither training

617
00:37:59.385 --> 00:38:02.525
nor experience nor emotion would allow us to process

618
00:38:04.035 --> 00:38:06.685
meeting needs that couldn't be met by us in the moment

619
00:38:07.905 --> 00:38:11.365
and providing encouragement in a discouraging experience.

620
00:38:13.975 --> 00:38:17.315
And I recognize one other thing about their actions.

621
00:38:19.695 --> 00:38:22.275
The love these church members were exhibiting incorporated

622
00:38:22.305 --> 00:38:25.315
something that I have often missed.

623
00:38:29.835 --> 00:38:31.605
It's in this word translated weep.

624
00:38:33.315 --> 00:38:36.605
The Greek word has an emphasis not only on tears,

625
00:38:36.785 --> 00:38:39.925
but the Greek word actually has an emphasis on the noise

626
00:38:41.735 --> 00:38:43.255
accompanying the weeping.

627
00:38:44.085 --> 00:38:45.535
It's an audible thing.

628
00:38:47.395 --> 00:38:48.575
As I've thought and wrestled

629
00:38:48.575 --> 00:38:51.695
and prayed through this while preparing for today,

630
00:38:53.235 --> 00:38:55.895
I'm convinced that the emphasis isn't really on

631
00:38:56.435 --> 00:39:00.055
an encouragement to go around and crying out loud

632
00:39:00.235 --> 00:39:03.655
and beating our breasts and wailing at the top of our lungs.

633
00:39:04.355 --> 00:39:07.335
That's not helpful, that's not edifying,

634
00:39:07.685 --> 00:39:11.215
that doesn't show others any real measure

635
00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:13.455
of the love displayed by Jesus.

636
00:39:16.155 --> 00:39:19.765
Instead, I'm convinced that this emphasis is on the fact

637
00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:23.005
that love involves interaction.

638
00:39:26.535 --> 00:39:29.465
Knowing that our Bibles are translations of manuscripts

639
00:39:29.465 --> 00:39:32.745
and the manuscripts, copies of original scrolls and poems

640
00:39:32.805 --> 00:39:36.425
and letters that were written, I tend

641
00:39:36.425 --> 00:39:39.905
to focus on specific words to help me understand what it is

642
00:39:39.905 --> 00:39:43.185
that God would direct to me that I need

643
00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:44.905
to grasp from a verse or a passage.

644
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:46.905
I'm sure you can see that as we've walked

645
00:39:46.905 --> 00:39:51.425
through this passage today, but I've skipped a word

646
00:39:53.195 --> 00:39:55.695
and I think it's a really important word.

647
00:39:56.805 --> 00:40:01.425
It's the word with in the English language.

648
00:40:01.425 --> 00:40:04.905
We know that with is a preposition that connects to things.

649
00:40:06.245 --> 00:40:09.105
But in the Greek, this word has some added flavor

650
00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:10.945
that we need to appreciate

651
00:40:12.415 --> 00:40:15.945
with is translated from a word meta in Greek.

652
00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:19.385
That word meta means it's a marker

653
00:40:19.565 --> 00:40:23.785
of an associative relationship, usually with the implication

654
00:40:23.965 --> 00:40:28.305
of being in the company, of someone

655
00:40:31.135 --> 00:40:33.035
Loving, like Jesus means.

656
00:40:33.165 --> 00:40:37.635
Being present and engaged with others

657
00:40:38.965 --> 00:40:42.275
physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

658
00:40:44.055 --> 00:40:46.755
Church isn't just a Sunday gathering and our neighborhoods

659
00:40:47.055 --> 00:40:49.395
and communities aren't just plots of land

660
00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:53.235
that we build houses, stores, and restaurants on.

661
00:40:55.695 --> 00:40:58.235
As we seek to love Christ more this year,

662
00:41:00.355 --> 00:41:03.145
let's seek to love like Jesus does,

663
00:41:04.735 --> 00:41:07.465
like the plumb line that he has exhibited to us

664
00:41:09.015 --> 00:41:13.105
that we see in scripture as we come to love him more.

665
00:41:16.685 --> 00:41:20.635
Let's be proactive to check in with people when you know

666
00:41:20.655 --> 00:41:22.755
of events in their lives, both good and bad.

667
00:41:22.785 --> 00:41:25.435
When you have just not seen them very often,

668
00:41:27.695 --> 00:41:30.605
let's celebrate big moments and ordinary moments alike.

669
00:41:32.135 --> 00:41:35.045
Let's learn to be present in their struggles.

670
00:41:37.475 --> 00:41:41.565
This presence weeping with bearing their burdens

671
00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:42.725
with something.

672
00:41:42.725 --> 00:41:46.285
Ryan Whitaker calls the ministry of presence.

673
00:41:48.825 --> 00:41:51.605
Who is it that we need to invest our time with and in?

674
00:41:52.385 --> 00:41:54.165
Who do we need to rejoice with this week?

675
00:41:54.185 --> 00:41:57.005
And who do we need to be present for as they hurt?

676
00:41:59.905 --> 00:42:03.675
Lord God, help us to love, uh Christ more

677
00:42:03.695 --> 00:42:05.995
by loving one another and the world

678
00:42:05.995 --> 00:42:07.875
around us like you do us.

679
00:42:09.925 --> 00:42:10.215
Amen.
