1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.800
All right, let's go and get started everybody.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.200
Thank you for coming on time. I was not even looking at

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.000
my watch. I didn't know that we'd run a little bit over but let's good

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.300
to hear everybody visiting and enjoying one another

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.800
we're gonna get started with a quick review

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.000
and some of you are saying well, I've been

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.100
here every week. Why do we have to review last week?

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.700
We had 27 brand new people and

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.500
so each week. We will have brand

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.700
new folk. And so we're gonna

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.300
get them caught up but probably the most

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.300
important reason is that we absolutely have to

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.600
know the disciple making pathway in

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.900
the disciple making Essentials and disciple

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.600
making definitions and then they're just some basic foundational

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.100
facts. The one that I'm

17
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.500
going to share tonight, maybe if not, the one of

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
the most important facts and so that's that's why I review

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
so let's go ahead and start with a pathway.

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.400
You've seen this before if you've been with us, but we have

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.200
worships on Sundays where we meet

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.100
here and but we're not satisfied with

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.500
someone just coming and sitting in worship and not participating. We

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.900
like to encourage them into one of our equipping groups.

25
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
The the equipping groups are men's groups

26
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.400
and women's groups and parents groups and

27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.200
all different kinds of groups. But but one of the things

28
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.500
that surprised me is just how many people come to

29
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.100
our community groups last week. We had a raise of hands and it

30
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.200
was well over 90% of our people involved in community groups

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.800
and that is a great sign for a church. But but

32
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.700
what I'm challenging Community groups to do is

33
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.200
to to be thinking forwardly about

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.900
how do we move Beyond just

35
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Um community group relational environment

36
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.800
into more of a deeper more

37
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.500
intimate more transparent environment and the

38
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.600
way we do that and this is our sweet spot is through our

39
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.200
community group. So here's our pathway. We're not

40
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200
satisfied with just

41
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.400
Sitting and listening even though there's value in

42
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
that and it's not going away. We want to go beyond just

43
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.900
sitting and listening and Beyond.

44
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.100
guys

45
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.000
my mom calls every night and

46
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.400
By the way, she doesn't just call once this is gonna happen at

47
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.400
least three times. And so Shirley would

48
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.200
I mean Carol, would you like to call my mom and say hey Phil's

49
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200
in front of lots of people and they're all

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.600
laughing for some reason. All right, if it happens again Carol's

51
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.700
gonna call. That's the way it's gonna work. All right, so sorry about

52
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.700
that. So that's that's our pathway. And now

53
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.200
we're gonna look at the essentials. I ask you

54
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.400
the very first night to do it and I'm gonna do it again tonight repeat after me

55
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.700
intentional leader.

56
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.000
relational environment

57
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.100
and reproducible process

58
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.500
that those are the essentials and and here's

59
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.400
my challenge to you tonight. We're not making

60
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400
disciples so much as we are challenging those of

61
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.900
you who are feeling so led to

62
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.500
become that intentional leader. We

63
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.600
would love for at least half of the folks who've come

64
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600
to learn what it means to make a disciples to think.

65
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.100
You know, I'm gonna give this a try. I'm gonna I'm gonna try

66
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.900
this out. I have been praying about and I'm

67
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.700
gonna I've got two or three people that I'm going to invite. Let's

68
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.000
talk about that invitation for just a minute.

69
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.400
when you're an intentional leader you

70
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.100
this is the wrong way to do it. I want to

71
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.900
disciple you and you could use it. Okay, that's

72
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.300
the wrong way. All right, the better way would be

73
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.400
to say I need you to pray about something. I'm starting

74
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.300
a group and we're going to we're going to look into

75
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.300
what it means to be a disciple and I need your

76
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.300
help. I need somebody like you in my

77
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.000
group because that's exactly what we're doing. We don't have and

78
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.100
this is not Jesus in The Twelve. All right.

79
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.500
This is fellow broken sojourners that

80
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.100
are working trying to get through this Maze of

81
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.600
life. And so I want I know you I've I

82
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.300
really care about you and I really think you

83
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.200
could help our group.

84
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.400
And so when you when you started off like

85
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.600
that a you're an intentional leader then immediately it's easier

86
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.300
to have a relational environment and one of

87
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.500
the first things I say when we meet together is that if we're

88
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.200
still meeting together in two or three years, we're

89
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.400
getting that that we're here to

90
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.300
reproduce ourselves. And one day my prayer is

91
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.000
that each of you will have a micro group. And so and

92
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.900
then this is what's going to happen over

93
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.300
the next 10 weeks. I've got

94
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.700
bad news next week. We're not meeting on the

95
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.100
calendar. We have a family equipping thing is that

96
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.900
is Wendy here.

97
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.200
windy

98
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.800
I don't believe you not for a second.

99
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.100
I'm looking back in my admin because she never lies to me my wife on the other

100
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.800
hand. I'm just kidding you.

101
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.200
No, no. Hey, if the calendar says it then you'll

102
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.500
be here and I'll be ready for you.

103
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.300
But I thought when he was going to be here to announce this the next week anyway.

104
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.700
Now you're beginning to see some of my strengths and weaknesses. So.

105
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.300
Okay, not next week with the week after okay. All

106
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.900
right, so

107
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.800
But but that's that is over the next 10

108
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.400
to 12 weeks. What we're going to be doing is

109
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.500
as when we started you each had

110
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.200
a leader and what your leader is

111
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.100
going to be doing intentionally is by

112
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.300
saying. Hey next week, would you lead the prayer time?

113
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.900
And going to ask somebody else in the micro group not micro

114
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.200
group to lead and they're not doing that because

115
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.300
they're tired or they don't have the decided not to pray

116
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.600
anymore or something. What they're doing is they're they're

117
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.300
giving them opportunities to lead. And then

118
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.800
what we're going to do is we're going to you I lead

119
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.800
you watch we discuss next week. I lead

120
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.500
I offer you a sliver of leadership. You lead

121
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.600
we discuss week after that is that you lead

122
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.900
and I watch and we discuss the week and eventually you

123
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.500
lead and I'm not even there, right? So

124
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.600
we're trying to reproduce ourselves and that's what's what

125
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.100
why it is. So essential last week we

126
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.100
looked at for the first time our official definition of what is

127
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.700
a disciple one who's following Jesus being changed

128
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.900
by Jesus and committed to the mission of Jesus disciple making

129
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.100
and so I want that just to roll

130
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.900
off your tongue because it's gonna be very very important that we're focused on

131
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.300
the same Target. All right, and then

132
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.100
this is the

133
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.100
The thing that we've done before is I wanted to

134
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.300
show you that down here in the large group the worship service.

135
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.300
There's not a lot of space for the

136
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.200
kinds of things that require transparency.

137
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.200
Let's just do this. I'm going to be I've been here long enough. I can be

138
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.100
a little bit honest with you. How many of you been here on a Sunday morning and didn't want

139
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.200
to be

140
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.200
Anybody all right. Hey give your hand

141
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.400
down and now you're gonna confessions of dishonesty. Yeah,

142
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.600
sometimes we just come to

143
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.300
church but our hearts are not in it

144
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.700
and you can actually get by with that in a

145
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.400
worship service but in a in a

146
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.400
community group, if you're just sitting there somebody might say is everything. Okay, and

147
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.800
you can say yeah, it's finally leave me alone and they will but not

148
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.600
over here not in the micro group. We are intentionally

149
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.800
keeping it small and gender-based so

150
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.000
that we can achieve and arrive at not

151
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.500
just conversations but conversations that

152
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.900
are transparent and conversations that are intimate and

153
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.500
conversations that will result in

154
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.400
accountability. I need you guys to pray for me because when

155
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.000
I came to church this morning, I didn't want to be here.

156
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.300
You can't say that to a person during the shaking of

157
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.400
the hands, you know.

158
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.200
All right, so moving on so this is something we

159
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.600
else we we learned last week and that is the ultimate result

160
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.800
of disciple making is transformation. What

161
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.100
is the disciple someone who's following Jesus someone who's

162
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.400
being changed by Jesus? We don't want

163
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.200
I mean Jesus takes us just as

164
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.500
we are but he loves us too much to leave us there. He wants

165
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.800
us to grow into His Image by his grace for

166
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.700
God's glory. That's what it means to enjoy him.

167
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.800
Bring him glory into enjoy him. We're transforming into

168
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.000
the image of his son. And so that is accomplished through

169
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.700
a development of lifelong practices one

170
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.600
word answers. What are some lifelong practices

171
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.400
that we're going to learn in this Township anybody?

172
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.400
Prayer, yeah. Yeah. I heard that one. No, I

173
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.300
didn't ask me that. What's it? What's another last long

174
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.500
practice?

175
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.200
Yeah, Bible Study Bible engagement. Not just

176
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.600
study but reading and hearing and preaching

177
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.700
and memorizing and meditating and obeying especially

178
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.400
right what else Bible engagement prayer?

179
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.800
What else?

180
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.300
Yeah devotional life I am.

181
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.300
I didn't there was a time in my life that I had

182
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.400
to be very intentional about getting up to going and

183
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.900
doing that. And now for some reason in my life. I can't

184
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.800
wait to get up in the mornings and start off with Jesus and

185
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.300
a cup of coffee in that order. Right

186
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.000
so devotional life, there's Community where

187
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.300
you're definitely involved in

188
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.200
the lives of people and challenging them.

189
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.200
To to grow in their faith.

190
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.100
There's also evangelism where we're living

191
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.400
scent looking for opportunities for God to put us in Divine appointments and

192
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.500
have gospel conversations. So these are some

193
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.400
of the lifelong practices practices now look

194
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.600
in your my wife

195
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.400
asked me to do this and so I'm gonna do this. All right,

196
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.900
we're going to look on page four of

197
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.400
week three last week's couldn't

198
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.100
find where we were what I hand out to

199
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.500
you is so much more than what we'll be able to study in the first 15 minutes.

200
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.300
Okay, and so but but Jesus

201
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.500
was a disciple maker and we

202
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.300
see over and over and all of the gospels

203
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.700
based upon his commandment in Matthew 28,

204
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.200
18 19 and 20 that he was doing that. He

205
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.500
was making disciples of his followers. And what

206
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.800
would I love about the story of the disciples is

207
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.400
that it's our story now listen

208
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.400
to me. Jesus could have picked anybody. He wanted

209
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.600
to be his disciples. He could have picked a list

210
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.900
of extraordinarily educated and

211
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.200
profoundly capable people, but

212
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.400
he didn't right. In fact,

213
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.100
it was just the opposite in Acts for 13

214
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.400
He says now when they saw the boldness of Peter and

215
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.200
John and perceived that they were what uneducated and

216
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.200
common NIV says ordinary

217
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.900
men they were astonished

218
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.400
Why because they recognized that they had been with

219
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.800
Jesus. So Jesus was a disciple maker and

220
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.400
it's not an accident that an intentional

221
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.300
leader like Jesus would pick people from all

222
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.000
different walks of life.

223
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.800
As a matter of fact, he intentionally chose

224
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.600
a wide variety of people from all walks

225
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.500
and stations of life and all became disciples

226
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.400
who may disciples in their own way. Think about

227
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.500
this. This is not an accident. We're not

228
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.200
trying to create a cookie cutter disciple that

229
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.400
you will make a disciple of the way. God

230
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.400
has created you to make a disciple out of someone who I could

231
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.400
never make a disciple of

232
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.700
If I went to one of my neighbors and I said hey, you

233
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.900
know a lady who I don't

234
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.600
know. She's let's just say

235
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.600
she's in her 30s. I've got some of those I said,

236
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.300
hey, I want you to pray about someone which group she's gonna

237
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.200
like get back from me. You're a creepy old man. Leave me

238
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.400
alone. But but some of you would have that that inroad

239
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.400
right? So think about

240
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.700
that God has created us who we are to reach people like

241
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.400
us so that we can continue to take this

242
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.100
gospel message to the ends of

243
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.100
the Earth and that was jesus' design from the

244
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.200
very beginning. They were professionals.

245
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.700
Luke was a doctor Matthew was a tax collector.

246
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.800
They were Housewives prostitutes. You remember

247
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.000
the story Mary Magdalen. She

248
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.200
was a probably a prostitute who

249
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.200
was once before a demon possessed person. So I think

250
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.900
Jesus is pretty good. Pretty much got the gamut covered Tradesmen

251
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.000
politician rich and poor all were

252
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.900
Disciples of Jesus. All right. Now, let's

253
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.900
talk about the one of the most profound facts of

254
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.600
this entire disciple making experience.

255
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.300
And that is this the holy spirit is

256
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.600
the teacher. What is the holy spirit? He's the

257
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.700
teacher who's the teacher the Holy Spirit now

258
00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.300
listen to this.

259
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.800
Jesus in John 14 was talking about

260
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.300
when he left and the disciples

261
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.600
weren't excited about him leaving. They had given up everything to follow

262
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.600
him. Right? And this is what he tells him truly truly.

263
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.400
I say to you now, that's a Greek idiom that

264
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.600
says listen and listen closely. What I'm

265
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.700
about to say, you need to hear whoever believes

266
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.400
in me will also do the works that I do

267
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.300
and greater Works than these he will

268
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.400
do.

269
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.500
Because I'm going to the father whatever you ask in

270
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.000
my name this I will do.

271
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.100
That the father may be glorified in the son

272
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.800
if you ask anything in my name, I will do it.

273
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.400
If you love me, you'll keep my Commandments and

274
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.100
so we've heard that passage before but have you

275
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.300
ever connected it with how it's going to get done?

276
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.700
Which is the very next verse?

277
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.500
And I will ask the father.

278
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.600
And he will give you another helper. That's

279
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.500
Capital H.

280
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.500
To be with you forever. Even the spirit

281
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.600
of Truth. So the holy spirit is the teacher now,

282
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.500
I know this about a young about a

283
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.500
new disciple maker. I know you're thinking in your

284
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.300
mind. I don't think I'm ready for this. I don't

285
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.500
qualified. I've never done anything like this.

286
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.200
I don't think I can do this. No one's going

287
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.100
to want to listen to me. In fact, what would I

288
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.800
teach anyone?

289
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.700
Well, you've got the wrong concept.

290
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.500
You're not the teacher the holy spirit is

291
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.400
the teacher as a matter of fact, this is really

292
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.600
really important. It's very clear that Jesus.

293
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.600
Jesus is clear that the disciple making is

294
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.000
is it's it's completely dependent on

295
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.400
the role of the Holy Spirit. The holy spirit is

296
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.100
the only one that will do the transforming work within someone.

297
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.300
No human being can do

298
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.300
that. Right? So with that

299
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.700
and I just want to take that off your plate you don't

300
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.100
You don't have to worry about this. You just have to be obedient and humble

301
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.300
and and enter into a

302
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.600
relationship where you guys can be genuine and open and

303
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.600
authentic and as you're studying scripture together, you can

304
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.700
say and and frankly, this is one of the very best lessons

305
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.300
instead of saying well, this is what I believe the Bible

306
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.100
says today you're saying man.

307
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.900
This one really stomped on my toes.

308
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.300
And then also they they pick up what what

309
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.400
and then you tell them and they say yeah, I feel

310
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.300
the same thing. I underlined it my Bible and you start to be honest with

311
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.700
one another about what are we going to work on together as

312
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.400
people who are trying to become more like Christ,

313
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.200
so

314
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.200
Let's move on. So this is

315
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.100
from your book The invest in

316
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.700
a few by Craig Etheridge. And he

317
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.300
he said the first dimension of a disciple is

318
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.300
he's devoted to Jesus and and I would say yeah,

319
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.300
I believe that but then it's clarified in the very next sentence.

320
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.600
That is this person has become convinced that

321
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.400
Jesus is the Christ and salvation is found

322
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.300
and no one else but him this is where disciple making

323
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.800
begins. Let's talk about why that is okay.

324
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.700
The Bible is also clear that when we enter into

325
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.900
a relationship with Jesus and our sins are Justified past

326
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.500
present and future sins are Justified that

327
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.800
we then receive the Holy Spirit and

328
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.600
who's the teacher?

329
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.500
the Holy Spirit who does the transforming the Holy

330
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.500
Spirit and so the very first step in

331
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.500
becoming a disciple and a disciple maker is that

332
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.800
these they're devoted to Jesus knowing that that

333
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.200
they've found it salvation is found in

334
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.400
no one else one of the things you could discover when your discipling

335
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.900
is that this is a person

336
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.400
Here She is again. You got a

337
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:55.400
lover.

338
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.800
Oh, yeah, somebody wants me to answer it.

339
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.900
All right, just answer. Hi, Mom.

340
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.800
Excuse me. Just a minute. All right.

341
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.200
The tricky part when you're my age and you get stopped like that.

342
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.900
You got to go back remember what you were talking about?

343
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.700
Okay, so so when

344
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.200
you receive the Lord and He

345
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.300
justifies you of your sins you then begin the

346
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.100
process that's justification. The next stage is

347
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.500
sanctification. That means that you're being changed being

348
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.500
set apart being transformed and that has

349
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.000
to start with the Holy Spirit. And so one

350
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.000
of our leaders ask me.

351
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.500
He said I'm thinking in terms

352
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.400
of evangelism. Is it wrong to have someone

353
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.500
in your micro group that may not know the Lord?

354
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.300
And I said well no, it's not wrong

355
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.600
to do that. As a matter of fact, I don't think there

356
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.300
should be a serious a separation

357
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.300
in between discipleship and evangelism. I believe that discipleship is

358
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.100
evangelism and evangelism is discipleship. Right? But

359
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.000
but I also want you to understand that I

360
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.500
it's impossible for someone

361
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.400
to begin the the ministry of

362
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.500
reconciliation to unto South sanctification without

363
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.300
the work of the holy spirit in

364
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.700
their life. And so that's

365
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.400
That is exactly what I'm talking about there. All

366
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.400
right, what are we doing here?

367
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.800
There we go. Now this next graphic is

368
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.600
this is not a theological. Graphic. This

369
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.200
is a practical graphic. Okay, and before

370
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.300
we get to The Graphic, let me say one more thing as you're

371
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.600
meeting with your micro group, you're listening

372
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.100
for things like this.

373
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.200
Yeah, I was raised in the church.

374
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.700
Is that evidence of salvation?

375
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.800
No.

376
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.400
my parents

377
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.400
We're both ministers.

378
00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.700
Is that evidence of Salvation? No, it's not

379
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.400
Jesus and anything else. It's Jesus

380
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.900
alone. Amen. And we have

381
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.000
the story of Nicodemus a very

382
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.400
very devout Pharisee who

383
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.800
came to Jesus genuinely seeking and

384
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.000
and what did Jesus said you need to

385
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.100
do? He said you must be born again. So it's not

386
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.800
about your religiosity. It's not about your knowledge of

387
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.400
scripture. It's not about anything other than

388
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.700
you having a relationship with Jesus, which I

389
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.900
wanted to finish by by looking at this graphic. Okay,

390
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.400
we will look for the next several

391
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.400
weeks at these stages of spiritual growth

392
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.400
and this is simply a graphic tool that helps you.

393
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.800
Assess where you belong in

394
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.000
this disciple-making effort and

395
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.300
you will find yourself somewhere in this

396
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.200
graphic initially before Christ. We're

397
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.600
all not just lost but

398
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.900
we're spiritually dead.

399
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.300
And this is just a simple

400
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.200
way at looking at these different different stages.

401
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.600
And just like Nicodemus he was a religious

402
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.200
man devoted to his

403
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.200
rituals and to his traditions and he didn't become a

404
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.600
Pharisee without learning significant parts of Torah.

405
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.200
But Jesus said unless you're born again. You

406
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.100
cannot see the kingdom of God. So when a

407
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.300
person

408
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.600
Prays to receive Christ and God does that miraculous

409
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.200
work of justification in their lives? They

410
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.800
receive the Holy Spirit and now they can begin that the

411
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.500
next step and that is growing to be more like

412
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.600
him. That's the process of sanctification. So let's look

413
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:45.800
at this.

414
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.600
So here we are spiritually then.

415
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:49.700
and

416
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.000
Ephesians 2 says you who were once dead?

417
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.100
All right, and so it's not just having a bad

418
00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.400
day. It's not just

419
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.200
needs to work harder. It's none of

420
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.900
that stuff you you that and that's the miracle of Salvation

421
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.400
folks is that it's not just

422
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.300
we found a better way to live our life

423
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.900
now. It's no you are completely dead

424
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.300
and separated for eternity

425
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.000
in in your lostness.

426
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.800
And because of Christ's complete perfect

427
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.200
work of atonement and and salvation.

428
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.100
Now you are made alive in

429
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.200
Christ Jesus and thus Begins the

430
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.400
the discipleship Adventure. Let

431
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:42.200
me say this and then we'll get finished. Then you

432
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.800
start the spiritual infant stage. This

433
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.400
is number one zero and one

434
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.100
the spiritual infant stage is this. All right?

435
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.600
Brand new Christians are very much like spiritual

436
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.000
infants and that they're just so stinking cute, aren't they?

437
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.500
I love their their in emotion,

438
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.700
like the the worship they

439
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.400
invite people this is incredible and but then

440
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.500
but then they, you know, they just don't have the spiritual

441
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.800
depth to be able to go past that just much and

442
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.200
so

443
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.700
How many of you have ever seen kids come

444
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.300
back from Youth Camp just completely fired up

445
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.200
and ready to win the world for Jesus, right and then

446
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.100
school starts a couple of weeks later and things simmer down a little

447
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.800
right, but so we're not satisfied.

448
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.400
The reason that you're here. We're not

449
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.100
satisfied.

450
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.800
with maintaining spiritual immaturity

451
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.800
we are looking at one day going from death

452
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.500
and to life and hopefully you've been able to share your spiritual start.

453
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.700
But now we're looking at going from spiritual infancy now

454
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.400
into spiritual past spiritual childhood

455
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.700
into spiritual young adulthood and

456
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.500
eventually spiritual Parenthood and we're gonna

457
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.000
study each of those stories. We're going to I mean

458
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.600
each of those stages we're going to understand what are

459
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.700
some phrases that you hear from those stages so

460
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.300
that we can and by the way, no one

461
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.200
is going to force this assessment on you. So I

462
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.600
think you're a two, you know, nobody's gonna do that, right? You're

463
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.400
gonna do this for yourself, you're gonna ask the

464
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.700
Lord to reveal to you and honesty where you belong in this these stages

465
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.600
so that you can advance in the right direction.
