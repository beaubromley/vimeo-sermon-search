1
00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:34.435
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:35.835
It's great to see you today.

3
00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.275
Maybe you're new to our church

4
00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:38.795
or maybe you were here last week

5
00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:40.035
at Easter for the first time.

6
00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:41.995
We'd love to meet you and get to know you a little bit.

7
00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:43.715
There's a new here area out in the lobby.

8
00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:45.555
Just go say hello at some point.

9
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.835
When you're ready, happy to meet you and include you in that

10
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.275
and try to get you connected here.

11
00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:52.635
But it is an exciting time to be here as well

12
00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.435
because we are starting a new sermon series.

13
00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:59.515
As you saw on the bumper video, the title is realigned

14
00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:03.995
and we'll be looking at what a life transformed

15
00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:06.715
by Christ actually looks like.

16
00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:11.395
And the prevailing image you saw there is that

17
00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:12.915
of a plumb line

18
00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:14.675
or plumb, bob, depending on

19
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:16.475
where you grew up in the country.

20
00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:20.035
Now, a a plumb line is simply a pointed weight

21
00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:23.995
that is attached to a string suspended from a chord

22
00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:25.075
like you can see it here.

23
00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.875
And, and through the consistent pull of gravity,

24
00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:31.195
it establishes a vertical reference.

25
00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:36.025
It's how people since at least ancient Egypt have,

26
00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:38.425
have set a vertical standard.

27
00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:41.185
They've made sure walls and towers and castles

28
00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.265
and other structures were vertical.

29
00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:45.945
It was the standard for accuracy.

30
00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:50.415
Even God used as an illustration in the Book of Amos.

31
00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:54.495
He uses the plumb line to tell Amos how far

32
00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:57.895
God's people had fallen from following him.

33
00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:01.285
Now, I think we can get this right.

34
00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:04.285
It's, it's understood that we can, uh, grasp that idea.

35
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:08.845
But let's, let's then think of an alternate way to try

36
00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:10.845
to find the vertical reference.

37
00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:14.405
I read one author talk about this.

38
00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:17.125
Imagine if the builder of a tower

39
00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:21.765
anchored the line to the ground first

40
00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:25.365
and then lifted the other end to

41
00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.565
what he perceived was a point directly above it.

42
00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:33.525
Like imagine if he set the vertical alignment

43
00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:39.525
from the ground instead of to the ground,

44
00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.425
like even the most skillful builder

45
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:48.225
with the best eye would get it wrong, right?

46
00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:49.945
So you could be four degrees off

47
00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:52.865
and you end up with another leaning tower of pizza, right?

48
00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:56.785
Uh, or, or maybe listen, maybe he's really, really good.

49
00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:00.885
He's really skilled and so he gets it just two degrees off.

50
00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:06.085
But he certainly would not be able to set

51
00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:08.245
a perfect vertical.

52
00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:14.015
It would only take a small error at the bottom

53
00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:18.215
to lead to severe misalignment at the top.

54
00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:24.295
But here's, here's what that author described.

55
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:27.935
See, every other religion,

56
00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:30.965
every other system

57
00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:35.285
of morality starts at the bottom.

58
00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:40.635
It creates standards from the minds of people

59
00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:44.475
and then it puts those forward as what you should try

60
00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:47.675
to obey in some way to try to earn God's love and,

61
00:03:47.775 --> 00:03:49.395
and try to earn his favor.

62
00:03:49.815 --> 00:03:53.355
You're reaching upward to try to gain the favor of God,

63
00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:54.795
but it's always off.

64
00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:01.505
Only the Christian faith begins at the top.

65
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:07.555
See, we are made right with God first,

66
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:12.585
and then we obey his law

67
00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:14.745
as it is suspended from above.

68
00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:20.215
See, it's not about somehow working our way to God,

69
00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:25.585
it's responding to his salvation

70
00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:30.545
in his power by realigning ourselves back

71
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:32.625
to the perfect standard.

72
00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.875
See, here's what the world does.

73
00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:39.675
The world sets its own standard,

74
00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.865
but Jesus shows us what vertical looks like.

75
00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:50.605
And see that's what this series in Roman 12,

76
00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:51.805
Romans 12 is gonna show us.

77
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.005
It's gonna show us what that standard is

78
00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:01.245
and then how we are to realign our lives back to it.

79
00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:06.485
How the Lord realigns us back to standard vertical,

80
00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:07.845
perfect center

81
00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:14.145
and why that's good for us, why

82
00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:15.345
that's good for God's glory,

83
00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:18.935
but also why that's good for the world around us,

84
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:22.275
how this will all play out.

85
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:24.235
So let's pray and ask God to help us towards that.

86
00:05:24.235 --> 00:05:28.035
Lord, we do ask you in light of your word and

87
00:05:28.055 --> 00:05:31.315
and what this picture will portray.

88
00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:33.835
And we pray that as Romans 12 becomes

89
00:05:35.065 --> 00:05:37.195
what we study over the next couple months, that Lord,

90
00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:39.755
you would just infuse it deeply into us,

91
00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:43.115
that we would realize how far off alignment we are.

92
00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:48.115
But how you are the perfect one pulling us back

93
00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:49.195
to that standard.

94
00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:55.285
As hard as that can be to think about the possibility

95
00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:57.045
of doing that, God, you empower us.

96
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.045
And I, I pray, God, you show us that today,

97
00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:03.765
even working today to change our hearts in Jesus' name.

98
00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:09.325
Amen. And so if you're not already there with me, uh, turn

99
00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:11.285
to Romans 12 in God's word,

100
00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:14.125
Romans chapter 12 in the New Testament.

101
00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.085
We're gonna be there for a couple months.

102
00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:16.445
So go ahead and put a bookmark there.

103
00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:17.485
We'll just be there every week

104
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.805
until school starts again in August.

105
00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:23.445
But um, Romans 12, new Testament, all the gospels

106
00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:27.935
and then Acts, and then Romans, Romans 12.

107
00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:29.935
Now, before we get there though, I think

108
00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:31.775
I wanna show you part

109
00:06:31.775 --> 00:06:36.215
of why we looked at Romans six last week at Easter.

110
00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:40.415
It wasn't just because it was a good study for Easter,

111
00:06:40.675 --> 00:06:42.535
it actually sets us up for today

112
00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:44.335
and for this series as well.

113
00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.135
And so just like last week, believer, listen, you

114
00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:51.335
and I, we must recall who we are

115
00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:56.855
I guess we go into today as we go into this whole series.

116
00:06:57.185 --> 00:07:01.325
We've gotta remember who you are

117
00:07:03.575 --> 00:07:05.145
because here's the temptation.

118
00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:08.905
I know it's coming as we go through Romans 12.

119
00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:12.465
The temptation will be to make this some kind

120
00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:15.865
of moral effort in order to make God happy.

121
00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:18.785
That you're trying to figure out a way

122
00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:23.305
to earn God's love some way somehow by being perfect,

123
00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:25.545
being aligned to his standard.

124
00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:27.185
And it's, it's all about your effort.

125
00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:29.665
Listen, we can't forget

126
00:07:30.205 --> 00:07:32.305
who we are as we go into this.

127
00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:38.405
What God in his love has already given us, not

128
00:07:38.405 --> 00:07:40.285
by virtue of how well we do with this or not,

129
00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:43.045
and we saw it last week.

130
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:47.485
First, if you are in Christ, you are dead to sin.

131
00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:51.485
Again, identity, this is who you are.

132
00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:56.395
Christian, if you're in Christ since he died

133
00:07:57.055 --> 00:08:00.235
to sin, you are dead to sin.

134
00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:04.075
If you're in him, you are dead to sin as well.

135
00:08:04.215 --> 00:08:06.715
It brought death. His death brought sin to nothing.

136
00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:09.915
And so if you're in him, if you identified with him

137
00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:12.515
by faith, you are dead to sin as well.

138
00:08:12.545 --> 00:08:15.995
That means you are not enslaved to sin any longer.

139
00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:19.115
You don't have to let it have control in your life anymore.

140
00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:21.195
I know it's hard to consider that,

141
00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:24.795
but it's true that Jesus died to sin.

142
00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.635
If you're in Jesus, you are dead to sin.

143
00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:29.915
It doesn't have control anymore

144
00:08:32.675 --> 00:08:36.445
because you've also been brought to life.

145
00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:41.485
Like not only are you dead to sin, you're also alive to God.

146
00:08:41.585 --> 00:08:44.575
Now, once in your sin you were dead

147
00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:45.975
to God in a sense, right?

148
00:08:45.975 --> 00:08:48.415
Eternally. But now you're alive.

149
00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:54.135
You're alive to God in Christ Jesus physically

150
00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:55.805
resurrected on the third day,

151
00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:59.805
one day we will physically be resurrected as well.

152
00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:02.885
But even today you are alive

153
00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:07.585
to God spiritually just as Jesus.

154
00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:10.665
It says in Romans six, lived his life to God.

155
00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:16.425
You are able to live your life to God in your

156
00:09:16.975 --> 00:09:18.745
life spiritually.

157
00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:23.045
It also means you don't have any fear of death anymore.

158
00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:25.325
You don't have fear of eternal consequences anymore

159
00:09:25.355 --> 00:09:28.365
because you're identified with Jesus resurrection

160
00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:30.885
that brought sin and death to nothing.

161
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:36.745
Well, here's what Paul then does with Romans 12.

162
00:09:38.165 --> 00:09:41.295
This is like the hinge phrase, these two

163
00:09:41.835 --> 00:09:43.135
verses we're studying today.

164
00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:45.615
This is the hinge of the entire book.

165
00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:49.725
All that's in the background, right?

166
00:09:49.725 --> 00:09:54.125
Chapters one through 11 describe in full form the dead

167
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:58.925
to sin, alive to God, nature of the Christian, all

168
00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:01.285
that God did to make that happen, he did it.

169
00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:04.245
Romans one through 11, that's what he pictures.

170
00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:10.555
Well watch the first few words of verse one in Romans 12.

171
00:10:13.615 --> 00:10:15.875
Now it says, brothers, he is meaning just everybody

172
00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:16.955
listening, brothers and sisters.

173
00:10:17.055 --> 00:10:18.875
So I appeal to you,

174
00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:22.795
therefore by the mercies of God.

175
00:10:27.255 --> 00:10:28.595
Now anytime you see that word,

176
00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:32.075
therefore you gotta ask what's the therefore,

177
00:10:32.385 --> 00:10:33.515
therefore, right?

178
00:10:33.535 --> 00:10:34.995
And so it's a linking word.

179
00:10:35.495 --> 00:10:37.795
It connects you to something he just said.

180
00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:42.035
And so what it's connecting you to is all of

181
00:10:42.035 --> 00:10:43.155
what I just described.

182
00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:44.555
Romans one through 11.

183
00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:48.435
He's described the gospel, what it does in your life,

184
00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:51.275
what it does to to, to save people

185
00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:52.635
who are sinners, enemies of God.

186
00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:55.195
He does all of that. Romans one through 11, therefore,

187
00:10:58.405 --> 00:10:59.625
but notice what else he does.

188
00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:05.565
He also summarizes all of chapter one through 11

189
00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:09.045
with this phrase by the mercies of God.

190
00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:12.965
Notice how he said it.

191
00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:18.045
Therefore, I appeal to you by the mercies of God.

192
00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:22.545
So he's just taken by the mercies of God

193
00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:23.945
that the mercies of God.

194
00:11:23.965 --> 00:11:27.785
He said all of that I just told you in 11 chapters.

195
00:11:28.405 --> 00:11:29.585
Here's what I mean by that.

196
00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:33.425
The mercies of God, all that is the mercies of God.

197
00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:37.545
You are all of that by God's mercies.

198
00:11:39.655 --> 00:11:41.395
Not because you earned it, not because you deserved it.

199
00:11:41.395 --> 00:11:43.115
You're an enemy of God. You're dead in your sin.

200
00:11:43.455 --> 00:11:46.875
He gave you all of that by his mercy.

201
00:11:47.865 --> 00:11:49.275
He's not given us what we deserve.

202
00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:52.635
Instead, he graciously gave us what we don't deserve.

203
00:11:55.355 --> 00:11:57.975
We deserve to be separated from God. We deserved his wrath.

204
00:11:57.995 --> 00:11:59.055
And yet he didn't.

205
00:11:59.055 --> 00:12:02.935
Instead, what he did is he died for our sin.

206
00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.685
Now, as you, you need

207
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:10.085
to know this about the way a, a pastor works.

208
00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:14.485
Like each week I'm discovering things along the way as well.

209
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.965
And I asked the question of this, I, I said,

210
00:12:18.385 --> 00:12:22.405
why is it plural mercies of God?

211
00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.725
Like I thought God is merciful. Is there just one mer?

212
00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:26.885
Like are there more than one type?

213
00:12:27.165 --> 00:12:29.125
I I just had to ask the question, why is it plural?

214
00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:33.565
I think because we're gonna need mercy upon mercy,

215
00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:37.045
upon mercy, upon mercy, the rest of our lives, day by day

216
00:12:37.065 --> 00:12:38.405
by day, mercy upon mercy.

217
00:12:38.515 --> 00:12:43.165
It's mercies right by the mercies of God

218
00:12:43.165 --> 00:12:45.725
that covers all your sin, past, present, future.

219
00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:49.005
It's mercies that we will need.

220
00:12:52.685 --> 00:12:54.505
But this again, it's clear here, right?

221
00:12:55.255 --> 00:12:56.905
This is who you are, Christian.

222
00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:01.555
You are dead to sin.

223
00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:06.085
You are alive to God. And you know why?

224
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:11.405
All because a merciful God loved you enough

225
00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:14.245
to save you and redeem you from all of that.

226
00:13:16.235 --> 00:13:18.925
Like that's love, mercy.

227
00:13:19.145 --> 00:13:21.565
The mercies of God makes you all of that.

228
00:13:21.565 --> 00:13:22.965
You don't deserve it. You couldn't earn it.

229
00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:24.765
You could never get there yourself.

230
00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:29.675
And yet he said, okay, I got you. And he made you new.

231
00:13:30.735 --> 00:13:33.145
So that's what he says.

232
00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:35.785
I appeal to you by the mercies of God.

233
00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:37.305
Don't forget the mercies of God.

234
00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:42.825
Well then the question comes, what do we do with that?

235
00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:48.515
Like what should our response be to that truth of

236
00:13:48.535 --> 00:13:50.315
who we are by the mercies of God?

237
00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:52.435
What should be our response to that?

238
00:13:54.205 --> 00:13:56.815
What he says next, give who you are.

239
00:13:58.885 --> 00:14:00.105
He says, remember who you are.

240
00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:02.185
Let me tell you, this is all who you are.

241
00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:07.025
Recall that mercy upon mercy to make you this.

242
00:14:08.955 --> 00:14:11.125
What do you do with that? You give who you are,

243
00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:18.065
you give look at verse one, all of it.

244
00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:23.045
Now I appeal to you.

245
00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:26.245
Therefore, by the mercies of God, that's his case

246
00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:31.445
because of the mercies of God to present your bodies

247
00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:35.105
as a living sacrifice, holy

248
00:14:35.205 --> 00:14:38.785
and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

249
00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:43.895
So again, the call to action

250
00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:47.215
is based on the mercies of God.

251
00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:53.685
I appeal to you by because of the mercies of God.

252
00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:56.445
That's why you should should what?

253
00:14:57.225 --> 00:14:59.605
That's why you should do what he says it.

254
00:15:01.105 --> 00:15:04.645
That's why you should worship God by giving yourself to him

255
00:15:07.455 --> 00:15:09.225
because of God's mercy for you.

256
00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:12.065
Here's what you do. You give yourself completely

257
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.905
to the Lord worshiping him as you do so.

258
00:15:15.565 --> 00:15:18.865
And listen, we could spend hours on this one verse.

259
00:15:20.735 --> 00:15:21.785
There's so much here,

260
00:15:21.785 --> 00:15:23.705
but just notice a couple things about it.

261
00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:27.665
Notice he says that true worship

262
00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:31.905
is far more than just singing songs.

263
00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:34.545
That's what we have to talk about, right?

264
00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:36.465
We're going to worship like we're just singing.

265
00:15:38.335 --> 00:15:40.825
It's far more than that. It's far more than just attending a

266
00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:42.225
church service once a week.

267
00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:47.075
He says, true worship here is is much more than that.

268
00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:49.435
It is presenting yourself

269
00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:52.355
as a living sacrifice.

270
00:15:55.315 --> 00:15:57.935
It brings up the idea of the Old Testament sacrifices

271
00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.975
where they would have this, this offering

272
00:16:01.315 --> 00:16:03.095
of a spotless animal

273
00:16:03.275 --> 00:16:05.455
or the for the first fruits of a harvest

274
00:16:05.555 --> 00:16:06.815
and they would bring it to God

275
00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:08.895
and it was acceptable if it was done based

276
00:16:08.895 --> 00:16:10.215
on God's standards.

277
00:16:10.215 --> 00:16:12.375
If it was said, here's how it needs to be, here's

278
00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:14.815
how it needs to be given all of that, that's

279
00:16:15.085 --> 00:16:19.095
what God's word says you are to be, that you are

280
00:16:19.155 --> 00:16:20.215
to do Christian.

281
00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:25.855
It says you are the sacrifice now, not that lamb, not

282
00:16:25.855 --> 00:16:27.055
that bird, not the grain.

283
00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:31.335
You are the sacrifice that you spiritually crawl up on

284
00:16:31.695 --> 00:16:33.175
that altar and die.

285
00:16:36.025 --> 00:16:38.685
Now, we know it's not literal when he says die,

286
00:16:38.795 --> 00:16:40.325
because what does he say it is?

287
00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:43.525
It is a living sacrifice.

288
00:16:44.865 --> 00:16:47.965
Living sacrifice. But hear me still a sacrifice.

289
00:16:52.455 --> 00:16:54.635
And I don't draw the line anywhere

290
00:16:54.895 --> 00:16:58.195
and say, okay, God, you've got me up until this point.

291
00:16:58.415 --> 00:17:00.555
But beyond that, I'm gonna take myself back.

292
00:17:01.335 --> 00:17:02.835
That's not how sacrifice works.

293
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:07.485
It's all in this is

294
00:17:07.495 --> 00:17:08.765
death to self.

295
00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.575
He says, a spiritual act of worship

296
00:17:12.905 --> 00:17:15.735
where you step off the throne of your life

297
00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:19.495
and you allow God the king to reign in your life.

298
00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:21.605
That's the sacrifice.

299
00:17:24.595 --> 00:17:27.215
Second Corinthians five 15 says it, he died.

300
00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:29.695
Jesus died that those

301
00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:34.015
who live us might no longer live for themselves,

302
00:17:34.635 --> 00:17:37.015
but for him who for their sake died and was raised

303
00:17:38.945 --> 00:17:39.965
and he didn't die.

304
00:17:40.305 --> 00:17:43.045
So that you and I could live for our own pleasures,

305
00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:45.565
our own comforts, our own pursuits of life.

306
00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.005
He died so that he could make us alive.

307
00:17:48.065 --> 00:17:50.605
And in so doing, doing, we live for him now.

308
00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:54.545
Like all of it, not just 60% of it, all of it.

309
00:17:57.925 --> 00:18:00.545
And did you notice how he described the sacrifice?

310
00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:05.825
He said, it is a holy and acceptable sacrifice.

311
00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:12.715
Now all over scripture, we are called to be holy.

312
00:18:13.705 --> 00:18:15.045
God says, be holy as I'm holy.

313
00:18:15.065 --> 00:18:16.245
So there is a pursuit of that.

314
00:18:16.245 --> 00:18:18.325
We'll get to that a little bit later, but,

315
00:18:18.325 --> 00:18:20.205
but again, I'm discovering things along the way.

316
00:18:20.245 --> 00:18:21.605
I don't think I fully put this together.

317
00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:25.405
I read that from my western lens.

318
00:18:25.565 --> 00:18:28.565
I read this in this idea like I've got to be a holy

319
00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:30.005
and acceptable sacrifice to God.

320
00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:32.285
That's not the way the context works here.

321
00:18:34.275 --> 00:18:38.135
The context says you already are a holy

322
00:18:38.315 --> 00:18:40.175
and acceptable sacrifice to God.

323
00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:43.935
Not because you've earned it, not

324
00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:45.775
because you should have done it

325
00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:47.375
and you did it and you proved yourself.

326
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:51.255
No, by the mercies of God,

327
00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:54.165
you already are holy.

328
00:18:54.505 --> 00:18:56.885
You already are acceptable to God. Watch this.

329
00:18:57.215 --> 00:19:01.325
Jesus in Hebrews 13, suffered outside the gate in order

330
00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:04.845
to sanctify the people through his own blood.

331
00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:07.685
That word sanctify means to make holy.

332
00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:11.455
He has done it already.

333
00:19:13.045 --> 00:19:16.865
And then Romans five, one says that we are justified

334
00:19:17.405 --> 00:19:18.465
by faith in Christ.

335
00:19:18.465 --> 00:19:20.745
That word justified is a legal word.

336
00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:22.705
That means you're made acceptable.

337
00:19:22.705 --> 00:19:27.515
You're made right with the judge. What does that sell?

338
00:19:27.545 --> 00:19:31.335
What does that say? It says, you already are holy.

339
00:19:31.595 --> 00:19:33.335
You already are acceptable to God.

340
00:19:34.945 --> 00:19:38.765
You are a holy and acceptable sacrifice to God.

341
00:19:39.025 --> 00:19:41.565
So hear this since you already are,

342
00:19:43.495 --> 00:19:47.725
since you know that God will receive you as his offering,

343
00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:50.685
you don't have to wonder anymore.

344
00:19:50.705 --> 00:19:52.605
You don't have to wonder like, well, am I good enough?

345
00:19:52.605 --> 00:19:55.645
Am I holy enough? Is God gonna accept me? He already has.

346
00:19:57.685 --> 00:20:01.145
And so since you know he's gonna receive you as an offering

347
00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:04.825
in front of your life to say, God, I'm all yours.

348
00:20:05.045 --> 00:20:08.625
I'm all in. That's why you say it,

349
00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:11.205
because I already am.

350
00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:13.045
I can dedicate myself to God knowing

351
00:20:13.155 --> 00:20:14.365
he's already accepted me.

352
00:20:15.575 --> 00:20:18.475
He will receive me as I dedicate myself to him.

353
00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:22.075
He's gonna receive it because it's his work in my place.

354
00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:27.705
And so you put all this together,

355
00:20:29.235 --> 00:20:32.135
That Means the Christian life

356
00:20:34.495 --> 00:20:36.995
is not a dreary obligation

357
00:20:39.395 --> 00:20:42.015
or just a set of rules that we have to follow.

358
00:20:44.645 --> 00:20:46.135
When you look at it through the lenses,

359
00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:47.990
we're looking at it for the last 20 minutes.

360
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.050
And you just look at this

361
00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:51.685
and say, this is what we're talking about.

362
00:20:51.945 --> 00:20:53.285
The Christian life is about.

363
00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:56.765
It is a joyful response

364
00:20:57.265 --> 00:20:59.765
to God's kindness in saving you.

365
00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:03.845
Man, I, I remember growing up

366
00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.925
and all I felt was like, man, it's just a bunch of rules.

367
00:21:06.045 --> 00:21:07.485
I don't get to have as much fun as everybody else

368
00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:09.525
'cause they get to do the sin stuff and I don't have to.

369
00:21:09.595 --> 00:21:12.525
Like, it's just this rule following. That's what it is.

370
00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:14.925
It's dreary, it's obligation after obligation.

371
00:21:15.305 --> 00:21:16.925
No, if we think about it like this,

372
00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:22.395
like God saved me from all that God's mercy is great and new

373
00:21:22.395 --> 00:21:24.915
and that what a gift.

374
00:21:26.935 --> 00:21:29.745
That stirs joy, a joyful response

375
00:21:29.885 --> 00:21:32.425
to God's kindness in saving me,

376
00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:35.495
a sinner, an enemy.

377
00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:40.325
And he never had to. He could have completely existed

378
00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:42.045
without doing anything to save us.

379
00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:47.265
And yet he loved me enough to do what he did.

380
00:21:49.595 --> 00:21:52.405
Like this is a reply of gratitude.

381
00:21:52.405 --> 00:21:56.805
This is an overwhelmed, saturated with grateful heart.

382
00:21:56.955 --> 00:21:59.645
Kind of love for God because he loved us first.

383
00:22:02.555 --> 00:22:04.615
But that's true worship, isn't it? Just imagine.

384
00:22:05.405 --> 00:22:07.695
Imagine if you walked in here every Sunday,

385
00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:11.135
if you walked into your workplace on Tuesday,

386
00:22:11.355 --> 00:22:14.095
if you walked into your school classroom, whatever it is,

387
00:22:14.235 --> 00:22:16.575
and your, your whole perspective

388
00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:21.395
is just, you're stunned by the fact

389
00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:26.525
that God brought you from death to life.

390
00:22:29.365 --> 00:22:30.385
How would you think differently?

391
00:22:30.405 --> 00:22:31.585
How would you speak differently?

392
00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:32.825
How would you sing differently?

393
00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:35.705
Give, serve, gen, all of that. How would you do that?

394
00:22:35.805 --> 00:22:38.345
So di you would say, God, I'm all yours.

395
00:22:40.705 --> 00:22:43.555
Your will be done in my life today. I had nothing.

396
00:22:43.835 --> 00:22:46.355
I brought nothing to the table. You gave me everything.

397
00:22:46.455 --> 00:22:48.275
So all I can give you is everything.

398
00:22:50.675 --> 00:22:54.915
I'm not perfect at that. None of us in this room are.

399
00:22:54.935 --> 00:22:58.155
But just imagine the more we awaken to that reality

400
00:22:58.155 --> 00:23:01.785
of the mercies of God and what he does through that.

401
00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:05.905
See, that's this whole transformed life we're gonna talk

402
00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:06.905
about over the next few months.

403
00:23:08.295 --> 00:23:09.905
It's just a response.

404
00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:16.795
It's a spiritual act of worship where you offer yourself

405
00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:21.585
to God a living sacrifice.

406
00:23:24.465 --> 00:23:25.885
But here's what I know will happen if you do that.

407
00:23:27.965 --> 00:23:32.785
As you do that, as I do that, what happens is that your life

408
00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:34.945
actually begins to change.

409
00:23:39.205 --> 00:23:41.145
You recall who you are, both

410
00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:42.985
that you were a sinner and God saved you.

411
00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:44.785
You recall who he's made you to be,

412
00:23:45.185 --> 00:23:47.685
and then you are then giving yourself to him.

413
00:23:47.905 --> 00:23:51.845
As you do that, you begin to then apply who you are

414
00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:53.965
as you live out life in this world.

415
00:23:56.525 --> 00:23:57.695
Like you remember who you are.

416
00:23:58.435 --> 00:24:00.975
And so you say, okay, God, I'm giving all that I am to you.

417
00:24:02.155 --> 00:24:06.435
And then it, it shows up as you apply it in your life.

418
00:24:10.965 --> 00:24:14.795
Thankfully, verse two here in Romans 12 gives us what

419
00:24:14.795 --> 00:24:19.025
that looks like, what that spiritual worship day

420
00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:20.625
by day would look like in our lives.

421
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:25.125
Look at verse two. It says, do not be conformed

422
00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:29.565
to this world, but be transformed by the renewal

423
00:24:29.705 --> 00:24:30.725
of your mind.

424
00:24:32.085 --> 00:24:34.975
That by testing you may discern what is the will of God,

425
00:24:35.245 --> 00:24:37.815
what is good and acceptable and perfect

426
00:24:41.705 --> 00:24:44.355
because we're dead to sin, alive

427
00:24:44.355 --> 00:24:46.075
to God by the mercies of God.

428
00:24:46.075 --> 00:24:50.515
Because of that, this is now what we can do.

429
00:24:52.275 --> 00:24:54.765
This verse is what we can do.

430
00:24:54.945 --> 00:24:56.405
And notice he says a couple things.

431
00:24:56.855 --> 00:25:00.165
First is that we don't have to conform to the world anymore

432
00:25:02.665 --> 00:25:04.155
because of the mercies of God,

433
00:25:04.155 --> 00:25:05.835
because who he's made us to be.

434
00:25:05.835 --> 00:25:08.835
Because we've given ourselves to the Lord who don't have

435
00:25:09.155 --> 00:25:11.235
to conform to the world anymore.

436
00:25:13.355 --> 00:25:16.765
Like that's the verse. Do not be conformed to this world.

437
00:25:16.825 --> 00:25:19.285
Now that's a passive translation there.

438
00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:21.845
And that's probably the way you've heard this.

439
00:25:21.985 --> 00:25:23.325
If you've heard it described

440
00:25:23.325 --> 00:25:26.405
before, don't let the world squeeze you into its

441
00:25:26.475 --> 00:25:28.725
mold, into its form.

442
00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:32.505
Nothing wrong with that. That's true. It's right.

443
00:25:32.525 --> 00:25:37.035
We shouldn't. But when you actually look at the

444
00:25:37.395 --> 00:25:40.035
original language of this, it could actually be in

445
00:25:40.035 --> 00:25:41.155
the middle voice.

446
00:25:41.655 --> 00:25:43.835
The Greek language has active, passive, and middle.

447
00:25:44.095 --> 00:25:47.075
Middle is where you actually do the action to yourself.

448
00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:50.695
And so the idea here is

449
00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:51.815
that this could actually be

450
00:25:51.815 --> 00:25:53.055
translated a little bit differently.

451
00:25:54.725 --> 00:25:56.335
This might have some more power for us.

452
00:25:56.595 --> 00:26:00.175
Do not conform yourself to this world.

453
00:26:01.825 --> 00:26:04.045
See how that's different? There's a

454
00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:05.285
responsibility there to us, right?

455
00:26:05.285 --> 00:26:08.805
Don't conform yourself to this world.

456
00:26:08.865 --> 00:26:12.205
Now that word conform actually has a, a root

457
00:26:12.265 --> 00:26:15.775
of fashion like that.

458
00:26:15.775 --> 00:26:17.215
You see some way of dressing

459
00:26:17.755 --> 00:26:22.455
and you try to match it even though it's not who you are.

460
00:26:23.275 --> 00:26:26.655
Now, we've all seen this, right? Somebody sees a fashion

461
00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:29.215
trend pop up on social media and so they try to copy it

462
00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:32.295
and it doesn't really match who they actually are, right?

463
00:26:32.355 --> 00:26:34.095
I'm not saying anything about anyone else,

464
00:26:34.355 --> 00:26:36.975
but uh, like you just try something

465
00:26:36.975 --> 00:26:38.775
because they think it might work,

466
00:26:38.915 --> 00:26:41.535
but it's not actually inside you, right?

467
00:26:42.275 --> 00:26:43.325
And so it doesn't, doesn't work.

468
00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:44.565
And we all look at that and think,

469
00:26:44.565 --> 00:26:46.245
that's really sad that that person's trying this.

470
00:26:46.245 --> 00:26:48.125
But they don't. They don't have any concept of that

471
00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:49.685
because it's not inside you.

472
00:26:51.265 --> 00:26:54.845
And so we have to think about this with the idea

473
00:26:56.355 --> 00:26:59.015
of what this author wants translated

474
00:26:59.115 --> 00:27:00.535
Romans 12, two to list to be.

475
00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:05.025
Listen to this. Stop assuming an outward

476
00:27:05.115 --> 00:27:07.345
expression, which is patterned

477
00:27:07.345 --> 00:27:11.985
after this world, an expression which does not come from,

478
00:27:12.165 --> 00:27:15.705
nor is it representative of what you are in your inner being

479
00:27:15.845 --> 00:27:17.505
as a regenerated child of God.

480
00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:24.565
Did you hear that? In other words, it's you are dead to sin.

481
00:27:25.305 --> 00:27:28.645
You are alive to God, all by the mercies of God.

482
00:27:28.665 --> 00:27:30.045
You've been made new.

483
00:27:31.995 --> 00:27:36.615
So stop acting as if you're not. That's what that says.

484
00:27:37.435 --> 00:27:39.975
You are child of God. You've been made new.

485
00:27:39.975 --> 00:27:42.175
You're a new creation, not of the old way.

486
00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:43.655
You're dead to sin. You're alive to God.

487
00:27:43.755 --> 00:27:46.135
So stop living like the world does.

488
00:27:46.475 --> 00:27:51.335
We are to live distinctly Christian lives in opposition

489
00:27:51.335 --> 00:27:53.295
to the way the world that's unbelieving

490
00:27:53.515 --> 00:27:55.415
and doesn't have the transformation.

491
00:27:55.415 --> 00:28:00.285
It's different. So

492
00:28:00.285 --> 00:28:02.925
we are not to morph

493
00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:07.095
into this whatever bottom up standard

494
00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:09.535
that the world puts forward and says, this is important.

495
00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:11.015
This is what we're supposed to be about.

496
00:28:11.165 --> 00:28:13.735
This is what's good and right. No, we're not to do that.

497
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:17.255
Romans 12, two says, we are to be transformed

498
00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:18.855
by the renewal of your mind.

499
00:28:22.295 --> 00:28:23.355
Now, this one is passive.

500
00:28:24.625 --> 00:28:29.235
This is God transforming you and me into his image.

501
00:28:29.455 --> 00:28:31.635
It says, be transformed.

502
00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:36.895
Do not conform yourself to the world. Be transformed.

503
00:28:38.345 --> 00:28:39.445
It, it's different.

504
00:28:42.635 --> 00:28:44.335
Now, the word here in the original

505
00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:45.615
language is metamorphosis.

506
00:28:46.635 --> 00:28:48.615
Now, if you've taken any sense

507
00:28:48.635 --> 00:28:50.975
of science in school at all, right?

508
00:28:51.035 --> 00:28:52.935
You understand this, that it's the concept

509
00:28:53.075 --> 00:28:55.975
of one thing turning into another thing like a butterfly

510
00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:57.495
coming from a caterpillar, right?

511
00:28:57.495 --> 00:28:58.895
They're, they're kind of the same,

512
00:28:58.895 --> 00:29:00.895
but they're totally different, right?

513
00:29:00.955 --> 00:29:04.815
So the transformation that God brings is passive.

514
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.215
He's doing the work on us.

515
00:29:07.715 --> 00:29:11.655
But notice in the text, Romans 12, two, there's an active

516
00:29:12.305 --> 00:29:17.125
sense when it talks about renewing your mind.

517
00:29:21.295 --> 00:29:22.675
See, here's the reality.

518
00:29:22.885 --> 00:29:26.595
Every one of us, we are immersed

519
00:29:28.215 --> 00:29:31.255
24 7 in this

520
00:29:31.305 --> 00:29:33.255
river called the world.

521
00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:38.605
And it influences the way we think, the way we act.

522
00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:43.825
And the only way, way to change that is

523
00:29:43.885 --> 00:29:45.465
to hop out of the river,

524
00:29:48.315 --> 00:29:50.935
to stop letting our minds drift

525
00:29:51.315 --> 00:29:53.935
to worldly fashion trends.

526
00:29:54.195 --> 00:29:58.455
And instead, we've got to renew our minds for the purpose.

527
00:29:58.595 --> 00:29:59.735
God has them to be renewed.

528
00:30:02.795 --> 00:30:05.965
Like we can't think like the way of the world thinks.

529
00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:11.125
We have to have new minds have to think differently. Okay?

530
00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:14.445
So how do we do that? How do we jump outta that river?

531
00:30:14.545 --> 00:30:16.445
How do we get outta that stream of thinking?

532
00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:23.765
Well, two Corinthians three 18 gives

533
00:30:23.785 --> 00:30:25.765
us some encouragement.

534
00:30:28.195 --> 00:30:32.965
Says we all with unveiled face, behold the glory of the Lord

535
00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:36.715
are being transformed.

536
00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:40.835
Same word into the same image from one degree

537
00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:42.675
of glory to another.

538
00:30:43.295 --> 00:30:45.795
And this comes from the Lord who is the spirit.

539
00:30:47.585 --> 00:30:49.165
You wanna know how we are transformed?

540
00:30:49.905 --> 00:30:53.965
We behold the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.

541
00:30:54.345 --> 00:30:55.965
How do we behold the glory of Jesus?

542
00:30:55.965 --> 00:30:57.365
We can't see him in this world.

543
00:30:57.365 --> 00:30:59.285
He's not walking around like he was 2000 years ago.

544
00:30:59.285 --> 00:31:03.845
How do we do that? Well, thankfully two Timothy three, 16

545
00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:07.725
and 17 says, all scriptures breathed out by God

546
00:31:07.985 --> 00:31:12.445
and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,

547
00:31:12.705 --> 00:31:16.245
and for training in righteousness that the man

548
00:31:16.245 --> 00:31:20.325
of God may be complete equipped for every good work.

549
00:31:20.625 --> 00:31:23.765
Here's how we jump outta the river and we land

550
00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:26.765
and we, we sit in this renewal of our minds.

551
00:31:26.835 --> 00:31:29.725
It's by gazing upon Jesus in His word.

552
00:31:30.745 --> 00:31:32.165
That's how he transforms us.

553
00:31:32.345 --> 00:31:33.925
So we're trained, ready, equipped.

554
00:31:34.105 --> 00:31:35.165
We understand things differently.

555
00:31:35.165 --> 00:31:38.805
We're corrected when we're wrong. It's through His word.

556
00:31:39.065 --> 00:31:43.445
God transforms us into the image of Christ through His word

557
00:31:43.545 --> 00:31:45.645
as we treasure Christ here.

558
00:31:46.835 --> 00:31:48.655
That's why this is so important, not just

559
00:31:48.655 --> 00:31:49.775
to have a quiet time every day,

560
00:31:49.835 --> 00:31:51.695
so you're seeing who Jesus is.

561
00:31:55.155 --> 00:31:58.695
So you're seeing who that perfect vertical standard is.

562
00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:02.185
You learn about him, you grow in him,

563
00:32:02.445 --> 00:32:04.865
and then he changes you in that.

564
00:32:07.915 --> 00:32:11.175
That's what then plays out to realize

565
00:32:11.795 --> 00:32:13.575
our form in this world.

566
00:32:16.785 --> 00:32:18.495
Don't conform yourself to this world.

567
00:32:20.325 --> 00:32:23.465
Be transformed by the renewal of your mind.

568
00:32:25.405 --> 00:32:28.745
And as that plays out, you then realize your form.

569
00:32:28.965 --> 00:32:33.585
In this world, we think differently like Christ,

570
00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:34.905
we realize a new form.

571
00:32:35.045 --> 00:32:40.015
The goal here is not just to think differently as much

572
00:32:40.275 --> 00:32:42.055
as good as that is, as helpful as that is,

573
00:32:42.285 --> 00:32:44.015
it's not just to think differently.

574
00:32:44.035 --> 00:32:45.335
The end goal is living it out.

575
00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:47.775
James one says, not just be hearers

576
00:32:47.775 --> 00:32:49.055
of the word, but be doers of it.

577
00:32:49.365 --> 00:32:53.375
It's not just up here theoretical. You are to live out.

578
00:32:53.495 --> 00:32:57.655
I am to live out who I am in him.

579
00:32:59.555 --> 00:33:01.775
Now, just think about it. Actually live it,

580
00:33:01.835 --> 00:33:03.775
not just correct a few bad habits.

581
00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.095
So I'm not as bad as a jerk down the street,

582
00:33:06.475 --> 00:33:09.775
but to actually live a whole new life,

583
00:33:10.725 --> 00:33:12.695
like complete everything different about me.

584
00:33:13.735 --> 00:33:17.295
That's what this says, by the way.

585
00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:19.615
That's one of the definitions of the word realize.

586
00:33:20.675 --> 00:33:22.655
We don't use it that often in that way.

587
00:33:22.675 --> 00:33:23.975
We think about discovering

588
00:33:23.975 --> 00:33:26.215
or awakening to something like, I realize

589
00:33:26.215 --> 00:33:27.375
that that person was in the movie.

590
00:33:27.535 --> 00:33:28.655
I didn't see it before.

591
00:33:28.725 --> 00:33:31.895
Like the word realize actually has a definition

592
00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:35.095
where you realize a profit on a sale

593
00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:40.245
to bring into actual existence

594
00:33:40.345 --> 00:33:43.085
and possession to render it tangible.

595
00:33:43.545 --> 00:33:46.805
In other words, you realize something, you apply it,

596
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.405
it shows up in your life,

597
00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:54.005
it becomes realized in day-to-day living.

598
00:33:56.025 --> 00:33:57.685
So that's what I mean here, church, listen,

599
00:33:57.785 --> 00:33:59.645
as we get into this series, that's what I mean.

600
00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:03.955
If you are a believer, you have been given

601
00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:06.275
a new form in Christ.

602
00:34:07.685 --> 00:34:10.065
Second Corinthians five, if anyone's in Christ,

603
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:11.305
he's a new creation.

604
00:34:11.305 --> 00:34:14.185
The old is gone, the new has come. You have a new form.

605
00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:16.465
So live it out

606
00:34:18.585 --> 00:34:19.885
in the world, live it out.

607
00:34:19.885 --> 00:34:21.645
You don't have to go get away from every.
