00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.140
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.780
I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.580
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.940
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.220
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.860
Good morning, church family.

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.020
My name is Brett McCoy and I am the student ministry director

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.900
here at Henderson Hills. And I've been here for a very long time. Yeah,

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.900
almost 10 months now. So, uh, if those of you,

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.660
if you are unfamiliar with who I am, uh, it's okay. I'll excuse it this time.

11
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.420
But, uh, we are coming up on my, uh, one year, um,

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.460
one year anniversary here. So I started on August 15th,

13
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.540
and it was just this past week where I had my, um,

14
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.700
very informal interview at Starbucks, um,

15
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.180
which is like Henderson Hills North. I don't know if you guys knew that or not,

16
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.940
but, uh, anyway, that was, uh, that was, that was like a year ago, uh,

17
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.900
this past week. So, um, it's been,

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.100
it's been kind of a fun week to look back and, uh, see where we've been. Um,

19
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.420
I do wanna say that, you know,

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.940
I dreamed of this moment of being here, sharing with you guys today.

21
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.780
Um, and I don't mean like it's a dream come true. I mean,

22
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.060
I had a weird dream about it a couple nights ago. Um,

23
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.900
TR Lewis was leading worship. Why? Why?

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.260
Someone had to come up in the middle of my sermon and get something from me.

25
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.460
And it was very, it was really weird. So I hope nothing like that happens, uh,

26
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.340
this morning. Uh, perhaps you're visiting here and you're wondering, Hey,

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.313
why,

28
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.140
why have there been so many different people preaching over the past few weeks?

29
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.300
Uh, and here's the deal. Our pastor, uh, John Wilmuth is on,

30
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.500
uh, sabbatical. And what that means is every five years, um,

31
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.780
our, our pastor lead teaching pastor gets a sabbatical several weeks off to just

32
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.340
relax, reflect, and get refocused.

33
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.620
So if you've been visiting for the past several weeks and you're like,

34
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.420
what's going on here? What's the deal? Um, don't worry,

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.660
pastor John will be back. Or maybe you're like my son Flynn,

36
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.300
when he announced that his sabbatical was beginning, um, and he said,

37
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.660
I think it was something to the effect of, I, I don't necessarily want to go,

38
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.820
but I know that this was a choice that I made.

39
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.220
Flynn looked over at me and he goes, what did he do? It's okay.

40
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.500
He will, he'll be back. Oh, man. Uh,

41
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.500
this morning we're gonna be in Psalm, uh, 58 and, uh,

42
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.780
it's, the title this morning is, uh, is Bad guys.

43
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.060
Good god. All right, bad guys. Good God. So if you're kind of wondering,

44
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.380
uh, where that's coming from,

45
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.540
we're gonna get into a little bit of background from the Old Testament book of

46
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.260
First Samuel Chapter 19. So, uh,

47
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.940
we'll be in a couple different places this morning. Uh, of course, Psalm 58,

48
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.180
but first Samuel, uh, 19,

49
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.460
I would like to give a little background on a scripture.

50
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.460
So especially in the Psalms, when you're reading those, those psalms, you can,

51
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.793
uh,

52
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.980
see and understand kind of where the person is coming from as they wrote

53
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.563
this psalm.

54
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.740
So first Samuel 19 verse 11 through 18.

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.380
That's where we're gonna start this morning.

56
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.780
One Samuel 19 verses 11 through 18.

57
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.140
Saul King Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him

58
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.340
that he might kill him in the morning. But Michael, David's wife told him,

59
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.780
if you don't, if you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow,

60
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.380
you'll be killed. So Michael let David down through the window,

61
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.500
and he fled away and escaped.

62
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.940
Michael took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goat's

63
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.340
hair at its head and covered it with clothes. And when Saul,

64
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.020
when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, he's sick.

65
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.020
Then Saul sent the messengers to see David saying,

66
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.660
bring him to me in the bed that I may kill him. And when the messengers came in,

67
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.700
behold the image was in bed with the pillow of goat's hair at its head.

68
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.260
Saul said to Michael,

69
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.740
why have you deceived me and thus let my enemy go so that he may escape?

70
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.180
And Michael answered Saul, he said to me, let me go. Why should I kill you? Now,

71
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.020
David fled and escaped, and he became,

72
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.940
he came to Samuel at Rama and told him all that Saul had done to him,

73
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.340
and he and Samuel went and lived at Naau.

74
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.020
This is one of the many times that King Saul attempted to kill

75
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.380
David, who was the future.

76
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.740
King David was a loyal subject to King Saul.

77
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.830
Many of the things that David had accomplished served to

78
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.670
benefit Saul in his kingship,

79
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.330
but Saul didn't see it that way. Saul instead saw it as a threat.

80
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.890
He was jealous of David and this story,

81
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.130
Saul sends these men to go and watch David sleep

82
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.970
so that they know exactly where he is gonna be,

83
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.690
and in the morning they're gonna kill him. So Michael,

84
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.570
who's Saul's daughter, by the way, David's wife helps him escape out the window.

85
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.810
Then she puts a statue in his bed,

86
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.730
covers it with goat's hair, puts clothes on it, and puts blankets on.

87
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.090
So when these guys come in, she's like, oh, he can't come out to play.

88
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.500
He's sick, right? And they're like, oh. And so then they go,

89
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.220
their job was to kill him, but then they just leave and they go, tell Saul, oh,

90
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.500
he was sick. He couldn't come out. Saul's like, b bring the whole bed.

91
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.260
And the guys are like, oh, okay. And then, uh,

92
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.220
David escapes out the window and goes to hang out

93
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.500
with Samuel. They go to live at Na off,

94
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.040
which is like a shepherd's camp. Such a relatable story.

95
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.480
We've all been there, right? We've all been there.

96
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.720
Our father-in-law, who's also our boss, hates us, right? Decides,

97
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.600
you know what done with that guy? Let's kill him. You know,

98
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.920
you've probably experienced that before. And then, you know,

99
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.360
our wife helps us escape out the window, right?

100
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.560
Just lowers us down and then puts a statue in our bed,

101
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.720
covers it with goat hair and clothes. And then the guys,

102
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.000
the murder squad who shows up to try to take us out, she's like, oh,

103
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.480
he can't come out. You guys understand, right? It's a, it's,

104
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.240
it's a relatable story. It's something we've all experienced. All right?

105
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.400
All right, well maybe that's not exactly true. Um,

106
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.200
but all of that, joking aside, David here,

107
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.040
he's in a pretty tough spot.

108
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.040
David's in a pretty tough spot and he's experiencing,

109
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.440
he's experiencing a very difficult situation.

110
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.520
And it is against that context that David has written.

111
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.400
Psalm 59.

112
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.440
So turn over few pages in your Bible to Psalm chapter

113
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.643
59.

114
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.400
Again,

115
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.320
that just provides a little context as to where we're gonna be this morning.

116
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.510
What we're gonna do is go ahead and read through the entire Psalm here,

117
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.630
and then we'll come back and, uh, break it down a little bit.

118
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.670
So join me there in Psalm 59, as we read in my Bible,

119
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.430
this is titled,

120
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.390
deliver Me From My Enemies to the Choir Master According

121
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.030
to Do Not Destroy, which just sounds like a metal song. All right?

122
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.670
A MTM of David when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him.

123
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.640
And then we get into Psalm 59 verse one,

124
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.120
deliver me from my enemies. Oh my God,

125
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.720
protect me from those who rise up against me,

126
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.720
deliver me from those who work evil and save me from blood.

127
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.680
Thirsty men for behold, they lie in, wait for my life.

128
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.040
Fierce men stir up strife against me for no transgression

129
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.840
or sin of mine. Oh Lord, and no fault of mine, they run and make ready,

130
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.920
awake, come to meet me and see you Lord,

131
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.800
God of hosts are God of Israel,

132
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.220
rouse yourself and punish all the nations.

133
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.860
Spare none of those who treacherous plot evil

134
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.343
sayah.

135
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.650
Each evening they come back howling like dogs and prowling about the city.

136
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.810
There they are bellowing with their mouths,

137
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.130
with swords in their lips for who they think will hear us.

138
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.970
But you, oh Lord, laugh at them. You hold all the nations in derision.

139
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:27.530
Oh my strength, I will watch for you, for you, oh God, are my fortress.

140
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.050
My God in his steadfast love will meet me.

141
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.650
God will let me look in triumph on my enemies. Kill them,

142
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.650
not lest my people forget.

143
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.770
Make them tarter by your power and bring them down, oh Lord,

144
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.770
our shield for the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips.

145
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.370
Let them be trapped in their pride for the cursing and lies

146
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.690
that they utter consume them in wrath. Consume them till they are no more,

147
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.650
that they may know that the God,

148
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.370
that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth sayah

149
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.010
each evening they come back howling like dogs and prowling about the city.

150
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.890
They wander about for food and growled. If they do not get there, Phil,

151
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.130
but I will sing of your strength.

152
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.650
I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning for you have been to me,

153
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.850
a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress, oh my strength.

154
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.330
I will sing praises to you for you, oh God are my fortress,

155
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.810
the God who shows me steadfast love.

156
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.930
The first thing that I want us to see here is that God is

157
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.690
near the desperate.

158
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.610
God is near the desperate

159
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.800
in the first seven verses. David is showing us some things here.

160
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.890
First off, there is an acknowledgement that God can save him.

161
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.300
David has experienced this type of deliverance before.

162
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.760
If you remember,

163
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.310
David is the guy that fought in battles and faced hardened

164
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.823
warriors.

165
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.310
If you'll remember earlier in the story of David,

166
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.070
we hear of this song that the people sang. If you're unfamiliar with it,

167
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.790
it's a really uplifting song that says Saul has killed his

168
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.030
thousands, and David has killed his 10 thousands.

169
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.670
Who doesn't want a song like that written about him? Right?

170
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.830
Like the people would sing these songs about their kings.

171
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.750
But this was while Saul was still the king.

172
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.950
They would say Saul's killed thousands and David his 10 thousands,

173
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.390
probably the beginning of David's problems with Saul.

174
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:49.110
But David knew that God could deliver him because he had been

175
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.910
in battles before.

176
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.100
David's the same guy who fought the giant Goliath to the death

177
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:04.920
when no one in the world gave him a chance to win that battle.

178
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.200
David knew that God would deliver him.

179
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.440
And if you remember in that story, the people are like, dude,

180
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.640
what makes you think you can go fight this nine and a half foot tall giant?

181
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.440
And David's like, well, when I was watching my father's sheep,

182
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.680
I've killed lions and I've killed bears and I've killed tigers. Oh my,

183
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.000
all right, maybe not that last part. But he said, I've killed lions,

184
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.360
I've killed bears in any other type of animal that tries to come and take me or

185
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.560
take any of my sheep. I have been able to kill them.

186
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.200
God delivered me then and God is going to deliver me now.

187
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.880
And that is this anthem that is repeated throughout all of David's life.

188
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.920
He's been in dire situations before. He has been desperate before,

189
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.000
and he knows that God is near him.

190
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.710
Think about the situations of desperation in your own life,

191
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.180
those moments when you didn't feel like you had anywhere else where you could

192
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.860
go. Where did you go?

193
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.540
James four eight says that as we are submitting ourselves to God,

194
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.540
that if we draw near to God, he will draw near to us.

195
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.100
In Matthew seven, verses seven and eight, in the Sermon on the Mount,

196
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.940
Jesus says, ask and it will be given to you.

197
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.740
Seek and you will find knock and it will be open to you.

198
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.220
For everyone who asks, receives,

199
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.700
and to the one who seeks fines and to the one who knocks,

200
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.540
it will be open.

201
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.620
The idea here is that when we are desperate for God

202
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.380
and we are looking for God, we will find him.

203
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.260
God's not hiding. He's not hiding from any of us.

204
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.220
That's not what he's in the business of doing.

205
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.900
When you and I are desperate for him,

206
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.300
he is near to us.

207
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.740
All you have to do is look for him. He's not the one,

208
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.060
he's not the one that's hiding.

209
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.900
Maybe you're desperate right now.

210
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:31.000
Maybe it's a time when you are sick or a loved one is dealing with

211
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.960
some sort of illness or difficulty.

212
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.560
Maybe it's a difficult time at work and you're trying to figure out what's next.

213
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:42.000
Maybe you're not quite to the end of your rope yet, but you're getting close.

214
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.110
Get desperate. Look for God. Now,

215
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.910
while you are in the midst of this desperate time,

216
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.140
God is near the desperate.

217
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.460
So David spends the first seven verses talking about that idea of being

218
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.660
desperate. But then in verses eight through 11,

219
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.900
David reminds us that God is good at all times.

220
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.300
That's the second point to ponder this morning.

221
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.220
God is good at all times.

222
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:22.060
Look right there in verse eight. But you, oh, Lord,

223
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.820
laugh at them. You hold all the nations in derision.

224
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.060
He spent the first part of this psalm asking God to step in.

225
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.620
He describes the evil that he's facing. He says, the people are evil,

226
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.700
blood thirsty, fierce, treacherous, howling like dogs,

227
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.660
bellowing and sneaky.

228
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.310
And then David starts to describe God.

229
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.490
He says God is so big that he holds entire nations in derision.

230
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.050
The word derision means contemptuous, ridicule or mockery.

231
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.090
It's like looking at someone's plans and laughing.

232
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.490
Several years ago,

233
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.650
there was a guy in the N B A named Debe Mtumbo.

234
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.730
Anybody here know who Mtumbo is? Some of you guys are like, what? De Kimbe.

235
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:14.410
Mtumbo was like a seven foot two basketball player in the N nba.

236
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.330
He played during the, the time when Michael Jordan played.

237
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.530
And a little bit later than that, uh,

238
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.210
Mtumbo is I think second on the all time

239
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.650
leaders of blocking shots.

240
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.890
So people did not get too many shots up over Debe. Mtumbo,

241
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.250
some of you guys are gonna go home and YouTube mtumbo. All right? Um,

242
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.290
you should. All right. It's a thing of beauty. But whenever,

243
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.370
whenever someone would shoot a shot and he would reach up and block their shot,

244
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.730
boom, sometimes knock it outta bounds,

245
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.330
sometimes he would swat it all the way to the other end of the basketball court.

246
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.010
He would do this thing where he would wag his finger.

247
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.090
Some of you guys are like, oh, now, okay, now I got it.

248
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:02.090
He would wag his finger and he would smile and the guy's

249
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.570
smile was huge. And he would have this huge smile on his face,

250
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.650
and he would laugh. He would be like, ha ha ha. No, no.

251
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.570
And he did that to people all the time. And as I read through this passage,

252
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.170
I was reminded of Dec dec, Kimbe, Mtumbo.

253
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.650
I know my brain's kind of in a weird place right now,

254
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.570
but I think in my mind,

255
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.330
that's kind of how it is with God.

256
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.410
When nations are planning things that are going against his will,

257
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.300
only thing is you might get lucky and dunk on Mato

258
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.140
Mambo. You're not dunking on God. All right? It's not happening.

259
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.300
But God would look at our plans or the plans of the nations or any plans that

260
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.740
goes against his will, and he would just laugh like,

261
00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.660
okay, good luck with that. Are you sure? You sure about that?

262
00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.660
That's what God's saying you. Is this really what you're gonna try? Okay,

263
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.340
go ahead. But that's what David's talking about.

264
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.060
He's saying God will laugh

265
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.620
At the things that people try. In Psalm 1 26,

266
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.380
and in Psalm 37 13, God says this,

267
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.300
I will laugh at your calamity and mock you. When terror strikes,

268
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.060
he laughs at the wicked because he sees their day approaching.

269
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.220
So God is good at all times,

270
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.660
even when the nation stands in opposition to his will.

271
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.500
Sometimes I feel like we can relate to that.

272
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.780
God is our fortress and his steadfast love will meet us where we

273
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.633
are.

274
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.260
David also says here that God will let him look in triumph over his

275
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.980
enemies. We know that God did that for David,

276
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.630
and I don't know what that looks like for us, but as followers of Jesus,

277
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.010
just think about for a moment what you have already overcome in your life.

278
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.640
What enemies were working against you,

279
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:23.040
what enemies were standing in the way of God's will for your life.

280
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.440
Sickness, despair, addiction,

281
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.160
family problems, financial issues.

282
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.930
Nothing is too great for God to overcome.

283
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.970
We believe that today God is good at all times.

284
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:47.010
Remember David is saying all this stuff about God when he is in a dark place

285
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.010
and people are after him.

286
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.290
And it might even seem like the bad guys are gonna win,

287
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.630
But David knows better. David knows better.

288
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.870
The third point to ponder this morning is this God is just

289
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.040
to the wicked. God is just to the wicked.

290
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.760
There's another section of verses here, uh, 12 through 15.

291
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.440
He's not only near the desperate, he's not only good at all times,

292
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.600
but he is just to the wicked.

293
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.400
It means that those who stand in opposition to him will be

294
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.080
defeated and will get what's coming to them.

295
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.840
No one is going to get away with what they're doing. You and I,

296
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.640
with the benefit of looking back into history are able to see that yes, in fact,

297
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.940
Saul and his army and his followers did perish.

298
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.940
And in some cases, Saul took other people down with him.

299
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:01.260
David had faith that God was going to deliver him, but also punish the wicked.

300
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.860
It's easy to say that, but sometimes it's harder to come up with those actions.

301
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:14.110
Sometimes it's harder to come up with those actions. But David lived that out.

302
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.230
David demonstrated this, this faith in God,

303
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:24.310
and he never took matters into his own hands. Like in first Samuel 24,

304
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.350
which is an event that took place after this story,

305
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.470
David and Saul were fighting once again with Saul's guys chasing

306
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.710
David and his men. And then all of a sudden, mid battle,

307
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.430
Saul has to make a pit stop. King Saul's gotta go to the bathroom

308
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.890
again, middle of the battle, not the ideal time, but whatever. All right,

309
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.730
so Saul goes into a cave and goes in and starts using the restroom.

310
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.770
That's the cave where David is. Some of you guys remember that story.

311
00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.570
And as as Saul is using the bathroom, David's men are like,

312
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:07.570
oh, bro, this is your chance. Go take him out. Like,

313
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:12.610
now, could you think of a better time? And David's like,

314
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.490
I, I, nope. Not gonna do it.

315
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:22.370
And so what David does is he cuts off a piece of Saul's robe while he's going to

316
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.010
the bathroom. Ick. All right? And he picks up that piece of his robe.

317
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.210
And after Saul finishes, he goes outside and he's hanging out with his army.

318
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.490
And David walks out and he is like, Hey Saul,

319
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.020
check this out. That's a piece of your robe, bro.

320
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.540
He's like, I could have ended you right there. And I didn't do it

321
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.290
because David had the faith that God was gonna handle it.

322
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.230
God was gonna handle it. Now,

323
00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.870
the application of this one is a little difficult for some of us to live with.

324
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.910
I may say that I believe that God is going to be the one who delivers judgment,

325
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:11.470
but I might have a hard time showing that I believe it when I've been

326
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.590
wronged. What do I wanna do?

327
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.030
Start flapping my gums about it. Start talking about it. Oh,

328
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.230
you're not gonna believe this.

329
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.030
Tell whoever will listen to how I've been treated unfairly.

330
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.030
This is not a demonstration that I believe that God is going to deal with it.

331
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.790
It's like I want to take those matters into my own hands.

332
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.310
If we really believe it,

333
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:39.070
it means that we realize that God is going to judge the ungodly in the book of

334
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.430
Romans chapter 12, verse 19, when talking about the marks of a true Christian,

335
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:48.940
a true follower of Jesus. Paul says this, never avenge yourselves,

336
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.620
but leave it to the wrath of God. For it is written, vengeance is mine,

337
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.020
I will repay, says the Lord.

338
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:02.140
So David was actually confessing a behavior that is attributed to a

339
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.060
Christ follower.

340
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.460
So live in such a way that you believe that God will be

341
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.380
just to the wicked. It is not our job.

342
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.193
Woo.

343
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.500
That's a tough one.

344
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.700
And then the fourth and final point to ponder this morning is that

345
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.900
God is a refuge for his people.

346
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.160
God is a refuge for his people.

347
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.130
The last two verses in Psalm 59,

348
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.810
verses 16 and 17, those verses say this one more time.

349
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.170
I will sing of your strength.

350
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.970
I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning.

351
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.370
For you have been to me,

352
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:56.090
a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress, oh my strength.

353
00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.690
I will sing praises to you for you, oh God are my fortress,

354
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.690
the God who shows me steadfast love.

355
00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.010
David once again brings it back to a focus on God's

356
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.690
character. You can't go wrong when you're focusing on who God is.

357
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:22.120
David describes God as a refuge for his people. He talks about God's strength,

358
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.680
his steadfast love, his availability as a fortress,

359
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.520
a refuge strength, and so on.

360
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.180
This is interesting because in verse 16,

361
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.500
David refers to this in the past tense,

362
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.313
did you see that

363
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.670
you have been to me a fortress?

364
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.670
He's counting on a God that has already been there for him,

365
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.950
God who has been there in the past.

366
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.873
And then,

367
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.830
and then he's telling us at the end that he has faith

368
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.630
because God will be there again in the morning emphasizing that God

369
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.150
will see him through the dark night because of who God has been.

370
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.510
David has hope for the present and the future.

371
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.790
He's going to tell people about it.

372
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.840
He's going to sing about the goodness of God. In this demonstration,

373
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.440
David is telling us that he has a reason to sing and

374
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:28.840
will continue.

375
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:37.000
Not only is that who God was to David,

376
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.440
but that continues to be who He is to us.

377
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.900
God is the place where we can run to for protection.

378
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.700
God is the one who will deliver us.

379
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.710
God is the one who has been there in the past,

380
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.710
and he is the one who will continue to be there in the future.

381
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.630
He does not abandon His people.

382
00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.440
No matter what you have felt, no matter what you've been dealt,

383
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.800
God has not and will not abandon you.

384
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.490
And I,

385
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.050
I want you guys to grasp that today because there may be some people here who

386
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.450
really need to hear this.

387
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.760
You're here for a purpose today.

388
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.570
God loves you and he wants you to be part of his family.

389
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.650
And today he might be calling you to salvation.

390
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.970
Maybe you don't know Jesus.

391
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.010
Maybe you are not a part of his family.

392
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.610
God is calling you to that today.

393
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.560
Maybe he's reminding you of that today.

394
00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.600
Maybe you are a follower of Jesus,

395
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.120
but you feel like you are far from him.

396
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.760
Perhaps because of a situation like this in David's life

397
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.210
that is no fault of his own. Maybe that's where you are,

398
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.010
through no fault of your own.

399
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.250
Are you where you are perhaps and you feel like,

400
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.570
I don't know why this is happening.

401
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.330
Maybe part of it is to help get you to that desperate place where you will

402
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.850
seek God and draw near to him.

403
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.080
God wants to be your refuge. Let him be that today.

404
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.950
Whatever it is, just know that you are loved

405
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.730
and just a moment we're going to pray and we are going to sing.

406
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.830
And as we wrap up our service today, we're gonna sing.

407
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.110
We're gonna sing some songs, we're gonna have a time of giving.

408
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.390
But when we wrap up this service,

409
00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:54.510
we are going to have people around the outside here who want to pray for you.

410
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.790
They're gonna have lanyards on

411
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:02.050
and they are going to offer up an opportunity for you to go to them and say,

412
00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:06.730
Hey, would you just pray for me? Like I need to be reminded of, of who God is.

413
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.770
I need to be reminded of this refuge. I'm dealing with some stuff right now.

414
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.560
And if you will go and you will do that,

415
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.840
they will pray and they will lift you up to the Lord.

416
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.060
You can pray with them or you can just let them pray for you.

417
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.510
That's what's gonna be happening here at the end of our service,

418
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.110
after we take an opportunity to worship together today.

419
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.910
If you're sick and you need healing,

420
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:39.150
let us pray for you physically, spiritually,

421
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.063
mentally,

422
00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.950
Just like the scriptures talk about in James,

423
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.510
draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
