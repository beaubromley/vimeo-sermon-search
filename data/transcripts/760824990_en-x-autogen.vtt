00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
Well, good morning to you. I trust your

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.300
enjoying the cooler weather this morning kind of nice wouldn't it?

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.300
Love this time of year.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.600
If you have your Bibles with you, we're going to be in Psalm 51

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.900
today.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.900
Taking a break from our study in Micah.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.700
If you are new to Henderson Hills, my name is Aaron Ferguson.

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.700
I'm one of the elders here.

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.400
And it's my pleasure to study Psalm 51 with

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.000
you this morning.

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.500
I must admit. I'm a little uncomfortable teaching behind

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200
a table. I usually like to have a Podium or something I

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.900
can stand behind.

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400
Especially after what happened to me just a few weeks ago.

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.600
I got home after church and the

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.100
Fly was open.

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.700
Yeah.

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.700
How many is that happened to in here?

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.500
Oh, I'm the only one. Okay. Well you guys

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.100
are lying.

21
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.500
So mad at myself.

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.600
The problem was I had been with people all morning

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.100
and nobody said a thing.

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.400
I'd even stood down here to pray

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.500
with people. No one approached me and now I

26
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.900
know why.

27
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.200
You know scared to death to see that down there,

28
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.300
but I was so mad at myself. I got home. I you know

29
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.500
for guys an open fly is like rookie mistake.

30
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.700
I thought I had mastered that technique and anyway through

31
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.400
the jeans in the closet. I was

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.900
so mad at myself.

33
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.400
But I didn't think anything about about it until a few days later. Wednesday night

34
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.300
was church. I put the same jeans back on I come

35
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.700
through the back door. The auditorium did a

36
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.000
quick check.

37
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.000
My Zipper was down again second time.

38
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.300
Now I start to go and fix the problem. But as

39
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.100
soon as I did a church member walks up with a question.

40
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.900
Yeah.

41
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
And so what do you do in that moment? I'm just

42
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.000
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

43
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.400
awkward three minutes there

44
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.300
ran back into the bathroom fixed the problem came back in

45
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.100
and as we sat and stood in the church service my zipper

46
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.700
made its way down again third time. That's

47
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.600
when it dawned on me.

48
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.500
I am not the problem here. There's a design flaw.

49
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400
in the genes

50
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.300
So I got home. I wanted to throw those jeans on my grill

51
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.400
and light them on fire, but

52
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.000
I didn't do that. I threw him in the Donate pile and they're going to

53
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.200
be someone else's problem.

54
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.400
So if you shop at thrift stores and you

55
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.200
just recently purchased some jeans you might want to check your

56
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.700
zipper.

57
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.200
So that's why I like to stand behind something.

58
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.100
Well, that's probably more than you wanted to know about me this

59
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.800
morning, but I am teaching about transparency and

60
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.400
confession.

61
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.900
Which is just openly admitting your shame and that's what

62
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.300
David is going to do in Psalm 51 this

63
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.500
morning.

64
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.100
And so if you have your Bibles there will be in just

65
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.400
a minute in Psalm. 51 Psalms are

66
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.000
just songs.

67
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.000
Just poems put to music. There's 150

68
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
of them. We know that it's taken us what three years

69
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.200
to get to Psalm 51.

70
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.400
But we know David has written 75 of

71
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.700
them at least and they're just transparent looks at

72
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.400
his life from the highest of highs to

73
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.700
the lowest of lows, which is Psalm

74
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.400
51 now.

75
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.800
Psalm 51 is very similar to six other what's called

76
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.300
penitent Psalms.

77
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.400
And I've listed there them for you on your notes at the top there. I

78
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.900
would encourage you to read the penitent Psalms sometime this

79
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.200
week and just compare them to

80
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.300
Psalm 51.

81
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.400
Now, what does it mean to be penitent? We don't use that word a

82
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.800
lot. It just means to express.

83
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.900
Sorrow for sin or guilt.

84
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.400
And that's what David is going to do here in Psalm 51,

85
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.700
raise your hand if you've ever sinned and needed forgiveness.

86
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.200
Yeah, everybody's hand should be up. We all are broken

87
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200
people and we need forgiveness. What

88
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200
do you do when you sin and you?

89
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.500
You mess up you offend god with something you've

90
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.800
done. Well, you cry out to God and penitent.

91
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.000
prayer

92
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.800
well before we dive into Psalm 51, I want to look at the context what

93
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.700
was happening in David's life that he wrote this

94
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.400
what was what was great sin in

95
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.800
his life prompted Psalm 51, and so

96
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.700
There should be at the top of your Psalm a little introduction to

97
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.100
the psalm. If not, this is what mine says.

98
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.400
Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came to

99
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.600
him

100
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.600
After he had gone into or committed adultery

101
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.200
with Bathsheba.

102
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.400
There it is. He gives us the context.

103
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.500
For Psalm 51 adultery with Bathsheba now.

104
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.900
I appreciate that. He said that but he's

105
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.400
not telling the whole story.

106
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.200
And so I do think we could learn a little bit more

107
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.500
if we saw the whole story. So keep your finger

108
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.600
in Psalm 51, if you would let's go to Psalm. Excuse

109
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.400
me. Second Samuel chapter 11.

110
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.400
Let's find out what the rest of the story is here adultery with

111
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.800
Bathsheba is just the beginning.

112
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.500
second Samuel chapter 11

113
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.900
if you like to connect passages, I would encourage you to

114
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.300
There in Psalm 51 to write second Samuel 11 and

115
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.700
when you get to second Samuel 11, you might write Psalm 51.

116
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.700
This is the backdrop for Psalm 51.

117
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.600
second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1

118
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.100
in the spring of the year the time when kings go out

119
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.100
to battle David sent joab that's his military leader.

120
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.400
And his servants with him and all Israel and they ravaged the

121
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.200
ammonites and besieged rabba.

122
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.500
But David remained at Jerusalem.

123
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.100
Now here's his first problem. He's all alone. He's not

124
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.900
where he should be should be with his men.

125
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.500
in battle

126
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.200
verse 2. It happened late one afternoon. When David arose from

127
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.700
his couch was walking on the roof of the King's house.

128
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.500
That he saw from a roof from the roof a

129
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.500
woman bathing in the woman was very beautiful.

130
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.500
And David sent an inquired about the woman and one

131
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.200
said is this not Bathsheba the daughter of a lion the

132
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.900
wife of Uriah the hittite.

133
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.300
Now time out. That's David's out right there. This is

134
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.500
a red flag. This lady is married.

135
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.800
you know, the Bible tells us God will not allow us to be tempted beyond

136
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.500
what we are able but with the Temptation he

137
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.700
provides a way of

138
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.400
Escape here's David's Escape. He didn't take

139
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.500
it.

140
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.400
So what does he do verse 4 David sent Messengers and

141
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.900
took her?

142
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.300
And she came to him and he lay with her.

143
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.200
And then she returned to her house and the woman conceived and she

144
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.700
sent and told David I'm pregnant.

145
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.900
Oh, so the adultery now has a consequence.

146
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.500
And what does David going to do next verse 6 David sent

147
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.500
word to joab?

148
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.600
Send Me Uriah the hittite and Joe absent Uriah to

149
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.800
David and when Uriah came to him David asked how Joad was

150
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.300
doing how the people were doing how the war was going?

151
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.300
And David said to Uriah go down to your house and wash your

152
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.300
feet now that's code for go spend time at

153
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.300
home with your wife. He was trying to cover his tracks.

154
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.200
But verse 9 Uriah slept at the door of the King's house

155
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.400
with all the Servants of his Lord and did not go down to his house.

156
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.400
And when they told David Uriah did not go down to his house. David

157
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.300
said to Uriah have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go

158
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.300
down to your house? And Uriah said to David the ark?

159
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.500
That's the Ark of the Covenant.

160
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.300
and Israel and Judah dwell in booths

161
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.700
or tents

162
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.600
and my Lord joab and the Servants of my Lord are camping in the Open Fields.

163
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.400
Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink and

164
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.000
lie with my wife?

165
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.400
As you live, I will not do this thing. He's an

166
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.000
honorable man, and this has to just be burning David.

167
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.700
Inside here that he won't go home to be with his

168
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.500
wife. So David said to Uriah remain

169
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.300
here today also and tomorrow I will

170
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.600
send you back and so Uriah remained in Jerusalem that

171
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.200
day in the next.

172
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.400
And David invited him and he ate in his presence

173
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.400
and drank and so that he made him drunk again. He's trying

174
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.600
to cover his tracks. He's trying to

175
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.300
to get your riots to go home to be with

176
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:46.800
his wife.

177
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.300
In the evening, he went out to lie on his couch with the Servants

178
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.400
of his Lord. He did not go down to his house. He's an honorable

179
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.600
man.

180
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.800
And in the morning David wrote a letter to joab and

181
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.600
sent it by the hand of your right.

182
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.500
In the letter, he wrote Set Uriah in the Forefront

183
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.300
of the hardest fighting then draw back

184
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.800
from him that he may be struck down and die.

185
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.200
All right, he's crossed another line here and he's ordered the

186
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.100
murder of this innocent man. Skip

187
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.800
on down to verse 26 when the

188
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.300
wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her

189
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.000
husband was dead. She lamented over her husband.

190
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.100
And when the morning was over David sent and brought her to

191
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.500
his house and she became his wife and bore him a son.

192
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.500
Hopefully again trying to cover his tracks and

193
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.600
cover up the pregnancy.

194
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.200
He thought he had got away with it. But it says this the thing that

195
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.300
David did had

196
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.300
displeased the Lord

197
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.500
Well what happens next God sends a prophet Nathan to

198
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.700
David if you'll turn to chapter 12 just verse

199
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:54.900
1.

200
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.300
The Lord sent Nathan to David. He tells him a story

201
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.500
to sort of appeal to his conscience brick his

202
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:02.700
conscience.

203
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.800
The story was about a rich man who stole a

204
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.500
poor man's land.

205
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.400
skip down to verse 5

206
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.000
David's anger was greatly kindled against

207
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.500
the man.

208
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.300
And he said to Nathan as the Lord lives the man who

209
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.800
has done this deserves to die.

210
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.500
And he shall restore the lamb forefold because

211
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.100
he did this thing and because he had no pity.

212
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.400
And Nathan looks at David says to David you are

213
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.100
the man.

214
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.300
this had to just

215
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.100
smack David in the nose

216
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.600
Thus says the Lord the god of Israel. I anointed you King over

217
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.800
Israel. I delivered you out of the hand of Saul. Why

218
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.300
have you despise the word of the Lord to

219
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.800
do what's evil in his sight?

220
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.100
You have struck down Uriah the

221
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.200
hittite with the sword and have taken his wife

222
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.400
to be your wife.

223
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500
And then in verse 13 David says to Nathan I

224
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.800
have sinned against the Lord.

225
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.700
This is the context of Psalm 51. Finally

226
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.900
David sees he has

227
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.100
Done what's evil in the side of the Lord, you know before we go back

228
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.300
to Psalm 51. I think there's some good observations we can make

229
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.200
from this story.

230
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.900
Just about our own sin. And I think it's going

231
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.700
to help us to understand or appreciate Psalm 51

232
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.900
even more. So, let me just make a few brief observations about

233
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.600
Sin from the context here in

234
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.500
second Samuel number one. No one is

235
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.100
without sin.

236
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.400
No one is without sin. You

237
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.600
all raised your hand just a minute ago. We've all been

238
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:43.900
there.

239
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.000
No one is without sin not Kings. Not you

240
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.500
not even me.

241
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.700
Everyone is capable of terrible wrongdoing.

242
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.300
No matter who we are and I love that about the Bible. It

243
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.600
does not gloss over.

244
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.500
You know, this is a superhero in the Bible David

245
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.200
and look what he's done. The Bible is very

246
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.400
transparent with his life.

247
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.700
No one is without sin number two.

248
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.300
While you and I think that our sin may

249
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.700
be hidden the truth is God knows it.

250
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.300
God knows it and he will bring it to light.

251
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.300
Now you may be able to fool other people and you

252
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.700
may even be able to fool yourself, but you cannot fool God.

253
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.800
God knows what you're doing.

254
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.900
Or what you have done.

255
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.600
number three

256
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.700
when we or I tolerate one

257
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.200
sin.

258
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.000
We just open the door to other sins.

259
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.800
David lusted after Bathsheba. He

260
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.900
coveted another man's wife committed adultery.

261
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.500
He tolerated those sins and

262
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.400
as a result, he ends up committing other sins

263
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.100
to hide that sin. It just turns into a sin snowball.

264
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.300
And that's the way it usually works with sin.

265
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.900
When you tolerate one, it just opens the door to others.

266
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.600
The fourth observation is this I can easily identify other

267
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.300
sins, but I'm often blind to

268
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:14.900
my own.

269
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.400
David spots the the evil of the man's action.

270
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.600
in Nathan's parable

271
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.400
But he couldn't even see his own actions as evil.

272
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.000
We can easily spot other people's sins. We were sometimes blinds

273
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.500
who our own.

274
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.400
Fifth observation is this my sin

275
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.400
always affects other

276
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:39.700
people.

277
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.300
My sin always affects other people. Sometimes we

278
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.100
think I'm not hurting anybody.

279
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.200
With what I'm doing I'm sinning. I know it

280
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.000
but I'm not hurting anybody else. That is untrue.

281
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.700
David's sin hurt a lot of people here Bathsheba

282
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.700
the child that

283
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.100
is going to be the result of this adulterous Affair.

284
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.700
He affected joab Uriah is

285
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.100
dead.

286
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.500
The ammonites his family. We're going to see even affects all

287
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.000
the whole Kingdom of Israel.

288
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.400
Your sin does not just affect you. It's

289
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.400
like a ripple effect that affects everyone around you

290
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.500
whether you know it or not whether you believe it or not.

291
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.100
The six observation is this while God forgives me?

292
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.500
Of my sin. He still allows me to experience the

293
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.300
consequences.

294
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.900
David is going to be forgiven.

295
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.600
But he condemns the man in the story that Nathan told

296
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.200
fourfold that man should pay fourfold. You

297
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.300
know, what happens today, but you keep reading the story.

298
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.300
He loses four Sons.

299
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.700
God allowed him to experience the consequences of

300
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.700
his sin, even though he forgave David of his

301
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.200
sin.

302
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.600
That's what I mean by there's much more to the story than what David writes

303
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:02.800
here.

304
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.100
Adultery with Bathsheba. There's a lot

305
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.500
going on here, and he has sinned greatly. Let's go

306
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.800
back to Psalm 51.

307
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.000
What David has done obviously is awful.

308
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.500
The Lord calls it evil.

309
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.600
But before you and I Judge Too, harshly

310
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.100
we have to point those same fingers back at ourself.

311
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.700
Every one of us is capable of terrible

312
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.400
wrongdoing just like David.

313
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.400
Now you say I haven't committed adultery. I

314
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.300
haven't murdered anyone, but you know what?

315
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.700
Our sins are just as odious in the eyes of God as

316
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.500
David sins and gee, you

317
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500
know, Jesus equates lusting after people.

318
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.800
with adultery in your heart

319
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.200
pornography is a plague on

320
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.800
this country. We are committing adultery in

321
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.300
our hearts, even though you may not carry

322
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.300
out the physical.

323
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.400
adulterous relationship

324
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.800
Jesus even relates anger and hatred

325
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.100
for someone to murder

326
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.800
ever hated someone ever wished them evil. Wish

327
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.300
them wrong.

328
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.900
What about lying stealing?

329
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.400
cheating

330
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.400
worshiping people other than God

331
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.800
Dishonoring your parents coveting Pride greed.

332
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.200
Jealousy Envy

333
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.900
Drunkenness, foul language, I mean I could

334
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.300
list a page of sins. We've

335
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.500
all been there. We've all committed these same

336
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.200
things that David has done. So let's

337
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.300
not judge him too. Harshly. We're in the same boat with him.

338
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.500
But what do we do? We're just as rotten as

339
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.300
David. What do we do?

340
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.200
I've got good news for you. This might be the most important thing. I tell

341
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.600
you this morning God receives sinners.

342
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.000
God receives sinners

343
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.100
He is Holy. He is perfect. He's pure

344
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.500
he's all good. He can do no wrong.

345
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.200
You and I are very much otherwise.

346
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.800
We are none of those things and you know that and yet

347
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.100
God receives sinners.

348
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.100
There's this huge gap between us but he receives us. What does that

349
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.200
mean? We have an audience with

350
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.100
the creator of Heaven and Earth we have an audience with

351
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.000
The only moral being in the

352
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.300
universe he is willing to listen to us

353
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.800
night or day.

354
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.000
He receives Sinners what? Okay, so what do we do?

355
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.000
We pour out our heart to God like Dave it's

356
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.600
going to do in Psalm 51.

357
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.100
We cry out to God and penitent prayer. So let's do

358
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.400
that. Let's just read verse by verse Psalm 51

359
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.900
and let's see what David does here.

360
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.500
I wish there were.

361
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.900
There was more organization to this Psalm really

362
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.300
struggled with.

363
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.000
How do we proceed?

364
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.500
Through Psalm 51 he there is no organization

365
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.300
to this Psalm. I what I'm about to share with you is

366
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.100
just kind of what I see him doing but

367
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.100
He just lays it all out there transparent confession.

368
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.300
He just pours his heart out to

369
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.600
God, but I think we can make some sense out of what he does.

370
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.600
First thing he does is plead for mercy.

371
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.400
Plead for Mercy verse 1.

372
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.100
Have mercy on me o God, according to

373
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.300
your steadfast love according to

374
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.900
your abundant Mercy blot out my transgressions. He

375
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.000
just pleads for mercy.

376
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.100
You know as Sinners we deserve God's Wrath.

377
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.800
We deserve God's judgment. We deserve the consequences that

378
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.700
are coming to us.

379
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.700
We deserve eternity in Hell separated from

380
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.000
him.

381
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.900
We know that.

382
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.200
But praise God, he's a god of

383
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.200
abundant Mercy. He doesn't give us what we deserve.

384
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.400
That's what David is saying have mercy on me.

385
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.700
Oh God. What? Why doesn't he give us what we deserve because

386
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.000
of his steadfast love he

387
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.200
loves you.

388
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.000
He wants a relationship with you.

389
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.500
He sent his son to pay the penalty for

390
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.900
your sin. He loves you that much.

391
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.700
God receives Sinners and he's merciful

392
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.400
to us just cry out

393
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.500
to God and plead.

394
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.900
For his Mercy there is hope for Sinners

395
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.200
because we have a merciful god.

396
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.300
He pleads for Mercy. What's the second thing? He does he

397
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.100
prays for forgiveness?

398
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.100
Naturally you offend god with your sin. You're going to pray for

399
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.600
forgiveness. Continue there in verse 1.

400
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.300
According to your abundant Mercy blot out

401
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.500
my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity.

402
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.100
Cleanse me from my sin.

403
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.700
three times in three different ways David asks

404
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.900
for forgiveness

405
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.800
I love that term blot out my transgressions. We

406
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:21.900
don't.

407
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.100
Quite understand that today we might say erase.

408
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.600
My transgressions hit the delete button.

409
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.500
On my transgressions, they didn't have erasers back then they didn't have delete

410
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:35.900
buttons.

411
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.900
What they had was ink.

412
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.100
And what he's doing is he's given a poetic picture

413
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.300
here of God is recording all of

414
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.400
your transgressions. He's got them written down.

415
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.700
God take your ink and just pour it

416
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.300
out over my transgression so you can't see.

417
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.300
the record of my wrongdoing anymore

418
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.900
blot out my transgressions Wash Me

419
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.600
thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse

420
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.400
me from my sin.

421
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.600
I love poetry.

422
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.900
He he's using transgression iniquity sin

423
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.000
kind of as the same thing, but there is a difference here.

424
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.300
Sin has to do with our actions Lord cleanse me

425
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.600
from my actions remove them from your memory

426
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.500
from my memory.

427
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.800
Cleanse me from my sin, but he uses the word iniquity

428
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.500
that has to do with who we are as a

429
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.200
person. We are depraved.

430
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.000
individuals rotten

431
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.600
corrupt

432
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.500
He uses the word wash me that word is scrub

433
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:39.800
me.

434
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.300
Make me a new person.

435
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.300
So blot out my transgressions just cover them

436
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:47.600
up.

437
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.400
Cleanse me from all my sinful actions just take

438
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:51.800
them away.

439
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.200
And wash me scrub my heart make me a new

440
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.200
person. I don't want to be a rotten person.

441
00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.800
anymore

442
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.700
You know, it's important to note here. God is the only one who

443
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.000
can do these three things.

444
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.000
He's the only one that can do anything about your sin your

445
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.300
spouse can't help you your family can't help

446
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.500
you. Your friends. Can't help you your elders can't

447
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.500
help you with this.

448
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.300
You can't do anything about this only God

449
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.000
can

450
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.100
cleanse you from your sin. Go to God and penitent prayer.

451
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.600
That's what David is doing here. So he's pleading for Mercy. He's

452
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.200
praying for forgiveness. What's the third

453
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.500
thing? He does he confesses his sin and his

454
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.200
shortcomings.

455
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.400
He confesses his sin and his shortcomings verses 3 through 6.

456
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.700
He confesses his sin in his shortcomings sin

457
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.400
what we have done.

458
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.200
Shortcomings who I am as a person watch

459
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.500
the two in these verses

460
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.800
verse 3 for I know my transgressions. I

461
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.700
know what I've done.

462
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.400
My sin is ever before me.

463
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.100
It just weighs me down. It's on my mind

464
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.500
night and day what I've done wrong. He's confessing.

465
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.600
What he's done against you, I have sinned

466
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.600
and done. What is evil.

467
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.500
In your sight. He's confessing.

468
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.400
His sins his actions when he says I

469
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.700
know and I know what I've done he is.

470
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.700
You could say owning up to his.

471
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.700
Wrongdoing he's not blaming it on anyone else

472
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.300
but himself.

473
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.400
you ever done that blame your wrongdoing on

474
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.100
somebody else if they hadn't done that I wouldn't have done this or

475
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.100
Find a grown up this way. I wouldn't have acted that way. No, no.

476
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.300
You and I must take ownership of

477
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.300
our own sin and not blame it on

478
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.300
anyone or anything. That's what David is doing

479
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:56.400
here.

480
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.400
verse 4

481
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.600
God you are you may be justified in your

482
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.500
words blameless in your judgment.

483
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.800
But behold, I was brought forth and iniquity and in

484
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.100
sin did my mother conceive me?

485
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.200
Behold you Delight in truth in the

486
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.600
inward being inside of me and you

487
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.400
teach me wisdom in the secret heart. What David is

488
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.500
doing here is he's comparing himself to God God you are

489
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.400
just you are blameless you Delight

490
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.200
in truth and wisdom, and I'm none of

491
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.600
those things.

492
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.400
God you are up here and I am down here behold.

493
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.100
I was brought forth in iniquity in sinned

494
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.600
in my mother conceived me. I've been rotten since

495
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.000
birth.

496
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.000
God you are this and I am this.

497
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.200
confess

498
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.700
The great gap between you and God I have nothing

499
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.400
I can bring you nothing Lord.

500
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.600
I'm rotten.

501
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.800
I'm sinful. I'm ashamed.

502
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.500
and what I've done

503
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.500
I love again the transparency of

504
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.100
the Bible David defeated Giants.

505
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.500
David defeats all of his enemies on the battlefield, but

506
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.800
he can't defeat his own sinful nature.

507
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.800
Only God can do that.

508
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.400
God you're up here. I'm down here. I am nothing.

509
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.400
I've defeated Giants. I'm nothing.

510
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.500
I have defeated all my enemies and yet I'm still nothing compared to

511
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:32.800
you.

512
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.400
See yourself for who you are in light of

513
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.500
who God is confess your sin

514
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.500
in shortcomings.

515
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.700
What's the next thing David does here pleads for

516
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.700
Mercy he prays for forgiveness. He confessed

517
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.100
his sin in shortcomings. Now, he kind of turns the

518
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.200
corner a little bit and he professes his desire to be restored.

519
00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.300
God I want to be restored. I want to be a

520
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.500
new person.

521
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.100
Watch how he says this verses 7 through 12.

522
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.800
Purge me he says with hyssop

523
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.300
and I shall be clean his hip is

524
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.500
a plant in the Old Testament

525
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.000
that they used as a paintbrush.

526
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.800
You remember when they applied the blood over the doorpost in

527
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.700
Egypt that was with hyssop the paintbrush?

528
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.100
And later priests would use it to sprinkle you with blood.

529
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.600
When you made a covenant.

530
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.900
When you were being forgiven of your sin, Lord?

531
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.300
Sprinkle me with blood Purge me and make

532
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.200
me clean. That's the picture. He's given us here.

533
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.800
Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

534
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.400
Let me hear joy and gladness.

535
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.000
Let the bones that you have broken.

536
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.600
Rejoice these are all poetic terms. Let me

537
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.400
You have broken my bones. I feel the weight of

538
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.200
my sin God. I want to be.

539
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.000
I want to experience that. Joy and gladness again.

540
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.000
Hide your face from my sins blot out

541
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:10.900
my iniquities.

542
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.800
Create in me a clean heart. Oh God renew or

543
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.100
right Spirit within me. I want to

544
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.200
be a new person.

545
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.000
I don't want to do this again.

546
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.600
skip down to verse 12

547
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.100
restore to me the joy of your salvation uphold

548
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.400
me with a willing spirit.

549
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.300
You know unconfessed sin you let sin

550
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.400
go on and you tolerate it in your life. It just

551
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.700
begins to weigh you down.

552
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.800
It steals your joy.

553
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.400
Takes away your happiness your your gladness.

554
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.200
He says it makes you feel like

555
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.600
you're crippled. You got so much weight and Stress

556
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.500
and Anxiety on you. You just you cripple

557
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.500
yourself. My bones are broken.

558
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.700
How do we

559
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.600
how do we free ourselves from that we we confess

560
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.300
all these things?

561
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.400
And we say Lord. I want to be a new person again, please

562
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.600
please help me.

563
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.400
Just feel David sincere plea for

564
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:16.900
help here.

565
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.000
Let's skip verse 11 for a reason.

566
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.600
Let's go back to verse 11 cast me not away from your presence take not

567
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.900
your Holy Spirit from me.

568
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.800
David you can tell it's very concerned about losing

569
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.600
the spirit.

570
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.200
If you know the story of King Saul King Saul had the spirit

571
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.600
of God on him and later. God took it from him.

572
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.600
In the Old Testament, we see the spirit.

573
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.100
Indwelling people throughout the Bible, but it's

574
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.800
temporary.

575
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.300
Kind of jumps from here to there.

576
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.000
This is much different in the Old Testament than it is. The New Testament. David's

577
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.200
concerned that the same thing that happened to Saul is

578
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.600
going to happen to him. God, please.

579
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.100
Don't take your Holy Spirit from me like you did with

580
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.300
King Saul don't cast me away from your presence. I

581
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.200
still want to be useful.

582
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:09.800
to you

583
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.500
now, please hear this you and I in the

584
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.700
New Testament the Holy Spirit indwells us

585
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.300
permanently.

586
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.200
John Chapter 14 verse 16

587
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.000
Christ is leaving. He sends the helper.

588
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.500
To indwell us forever. He says

589
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.900
you and I don't have to worry about verse 11. Nothing

590
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.300
can separate you from the love of

591
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.400
God. You have the Holy Spirit in you

592
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.300
permanently. So we don't have to worry

593
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.200
about that. But our fellowship with God has been

594
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.800
broken by our sin and God seems distant

595
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.700
to us, even though he's right there. He seems distant because

596
00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.500
we have hindered our fellowship with him because

597
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.300
of our sin.

598
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.500
What's the fifth thing David does here?

599
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.500
He expresses his repentance.

600
00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.100
He expresses his repentance.

601
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.300
Repentance is just a change.

602
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.300
a change in heart a change in Attitude a change

603
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.300
in actions you're going one way when you repent

604
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.500
you turn around and go completely the opposite way and I'll

605
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.800
just be honest with you if you

606
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.300
Pray, a prayer of forgiveness without repentance.

607
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.600
You're just saying a bunch of words.

608
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.500
You're basically saying God, excuse me, instead of

609
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.200
God, forgive me. Excuse me, God I'm going

610
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.200
to do this again. I know.

611
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.900
Wait, wait, we have to have repentance.

612
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.500
As a part of our prayer God, I

613
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.000
don't want to go down the same road again. I want to

614
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.200
go down a different Road. I want to be a different person. I don't

615
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.000
want to do that again.

616
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.300
It's not excuse me. It's

617
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.400
forgive me repentance. I'm going to change.

618
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.500
So notice how David changes he begins

619
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.600
to see life on the other side of forgiveness.

620
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.200
Look at verse 13 through 17. Then

621
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.900
I will teach transgressors your

622
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.500
ways and sinners will return to

623
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:12.800
you.

624
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.300
Deliver me from blood guiltiness o God of my salvation.

625
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.800
And my tongue will sing aloud at your righteousness.

626
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.200
Lord open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise

627
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.600
David wants to use his

628
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.000
failure as a way to glorify God after

629
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.200
the Forgiveness after the restoration

630
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.400
Aren't you glad God uses imperfect people to do his work?

631
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.500
He's the god of Second Chances third chances

632
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.700
fourth chances if he just used Perfect People

633
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.200
you and I would never get a chance to be used by

634
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:51.500
God.

635
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.000
But he doesn't do that.

636
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.500
Whatever. God has saved you from whatever God

637
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.500
has done in your life use it to tell other people. I

638
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.300
was rotten.

639
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.000
And I'm still rotten except for Christ.

640
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.300
And here's what he's done in my life. He can do the same thing for you. That's

641
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.200
what David is saying.

642
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.700
I will teach transgressors your ways.

643
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.600
I'm gonna change the direction of my life.

644
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.700
verse 16

645
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.300
for you will not Delight in sacrifice, or I would

646
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:23.500
give it.

647
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.900
You will not be pleased with a burnt offering.

648
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.100
The sacrifices of God are a broken

649
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.200
spirit and a broken and contrite heart o God,

650
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.700
you will not despise.

651
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.100
What he's talking about here is a change in his

652
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.800
worship.

653
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.100
If you carry sin in here and you never

654
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.400
let God deal with it.

655
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.400
You and I are just going through the motions saying the

656
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:50.900
words.

657
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.500
We're here because this is what we do on Sunday.

658
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:56.700
God

659
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.200
is he doesn't want you just to go through the motions. He wants

660
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.200
to deal with your sin what you're doing.

661
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.200
He wants to restore that relationship between you and he

662
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.200
In other words he wants to you to be broken.

663
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.100
And contrite the word contrite here is humble.

664
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.900
Be humbled before the Lord.

665
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.500
Let him deal with what you've done let him

666
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.700
deal with who you are.

667
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.700
Don't come in and out of here and not leave restored

668
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.500
in your relationship with

669
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.100
the Lord. Otherwise, you're just going through the motions.

670
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.200
rituals

671
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.200
so just what we do and David saying

672
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.100
I would give you a sacrifice, but you wouldn't take it.

673
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.700
Does he not like sacrifices? Yes, he does. It's a

674
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.100
sign of worship, but it's just going through the

675
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.900
motions unless you repent of what you've done and

676
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.700
you come to God with a broken and humble spirit.

677
00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:58.900
How's your worship been?

678
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.900
Is it cold?

679
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.400
and distant

680
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.000
is it sincere?

681
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.900
and genuine

682
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.700
and humble and broken

683
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.400
can tell where you're at with the Lord just by

684
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.200
gauging your worship.

685
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.800
finally

686
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.200
David ends 18 and 19. He asked God

687
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.500
the bless others despite his sin

688
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.300
remember?

689
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.000
Sin is a ripple effect. We affect others

690
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.500
with our sin whether we know it or not, whether we

691
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.900
believe that or not and he's concerned that he has affected.

692
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.200
The nation as a whole because the King has done what

693
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.800
he's done. The nation is not going to be

694
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.200
Blessed so look at Verse 18.

695
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.500
Do good to Zion in your good pleasure.

696
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.200
Don't?

697
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.500
Base your favor on God's people he says.

698
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.400
because of me

699
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.300
Please do good.

700
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.100
To Zion to Jerusalem build up the walls of Jerusalem. Then

701
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.300
you will Delight in right sacrifices and

702
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.600
burn offerings whole burn offerings and

703
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.800
Bulls will be offered on your altar again.

704
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.400
He's talking about worship. Don't allow what

705
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.100
I've done to hinder your favor on others.

706
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.800
This is just a

707
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.400
a heartfelt sincere

708
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.700
cry out to the Lord

709
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.900
penitent prayer

710
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.700
God receives sinners

711
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.600
and I got better news God redeems.

712
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.300
sinners

713
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.700
how do we know that?

714
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.700
We are forgiven when we confess our sins like David has

715
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.800
done listen to First John 1:9.

716
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.300
You're familiar with this.

717
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.600
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to

718
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.500
forgive us our sins and to cleanse

719
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.700
us from all unrighteousness if we

720
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.300
confess.

721
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.300
repent

722
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.900
or humble before the Lord transparent

723
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.600
He's faithful to forgive us and cleanse us

724
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.500
from all unrighteousness. If you back up to verse 7, he

725
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.200
says this the very end the blood of

726
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.700
Jesus is what cleanses all sins.

727
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.800
Listen, it's not David's prayer.

728
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.400
That forgave David there's no.

729
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.900
There's no formula. There's no right words.

730
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.800
That you have to say.

731
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.600
For God to forgive you David was forgiven because

732
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.600
God is merciful.

733
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.000
And God forgives and he loves.

734
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.400
us

735
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.500
and he forgave David because of Christ.

736
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.100
The same is for you you and I there's no certain words.

737
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.200
There's no formula. We just

738
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.400
throw ourselves before a merciful god and say

739
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.500
I am rotten.

740
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.500
But because of Christ I'm asking that you forgive me

741
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.700
blot out my sins.

742
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.400
Purge my heart

743
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.600
Scrub me.

744
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.100
Make me new because of Christ we know.

745
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.700
that God forgives us because of our

746
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.000
sincere confession

747
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.300
I want to ask you a question as we close.

748
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.100
Gonna do something a little different today.

749
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.600
I just want to ask you are you aware of the sin in

750
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.300
your life today right now?

751
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.500
Are you aware?

752
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.000
Of the ways that you are offending God.

753
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.300
Those of you are not Christians you don't know.

754
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.700
Christ as your savior

755
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.800
one of these days you're going to have to stand before God and

756
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.500
answer for your sins.

757
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.000
And without Christ that picture is not going to

758
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.300
be pretty.

759
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.800
You will spend eternity separated from God.

760
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.500
Don't leave here today and be our prayer

761
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.600
that you come to Christ.

762
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.700
And you know him as your savior.

763
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.200
I realize most of you though have given your life to

764
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.100
Christ. Are you aware of the sin in your life

765
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.000
and how it has?

766
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.900
Broken your fellowship with him.

767
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.200
You don't lose your salvation because you sin your sin

768
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.900
is Forgiven past present and future. We know that.

769
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.400
But your fellowship with God may be hindered.

770
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.700
broken clouded

771
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.100
can you hear God's voice right now in your life?

772
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.900
Are you sensitive to his Spirit? Can you?

773
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.500
discern his will

774
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.400
for your life

775
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.800
Are you experiencing the joy?

776
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.500
Of your salvation. If not, there's probably sin in

777
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.900
your life that you've not dealt with.

778
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.700
Don't leave here today.

779
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.300
Without dealing with your sin.

780
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.500
What are you hiding?

781
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.700
What are you ignoring?

782
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.100
What are you tolerating that you shouldn't be?

783
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:19.900
cry out to God

784
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.200
In penitent prayer he receives sinners.

785
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.100
And he redeems sinners.
