00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:12.000
here you

2
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.000
well, good morning.

3
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.300
That was okay.

4
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.600
I think you can do better. Good morning.

5
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.100
That's better.

6
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.400
So it has been a week, hasn't it?

7
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
I think spring is coming.

8
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.600
I think it's coming this week.

9
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.100
Sun's out today, which is a big win.

10
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.600
It's not 50 degrees outside. I don't think it's supposed to be this week. So

11
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.400
that's a big win.

12
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
It's been a big week and it was a big week for OBU.

13
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.000
thanks to all of our Henderson Hills friends who

14
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.800
joined about 200 others who came

15
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.500
out yesterday and helped

16
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.000
us clean and

17
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
clean clean debris around the campus clean debris

18
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
all through our our facilities

19
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.500
and God has done an

20
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
unbelievable work. I've got to tell you in a week

21
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200
and I've said it before this past week,

22
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.700
but what a difference a week makes some

23
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.400
of you need that kind of renewal in your life.

24
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.100
If you don't know last week, I think

25
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.700
I can't even remember. I feel like I'm in a Time Warp. I don't know who I

26
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300
am or where I am. Really? It's been such

27
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.300
a crazy period of time since April 19th,

28
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.100
but on April 19th, we were

29
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.400
hit with a tornado and the tornado went directly through campus.

30
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.000
And it hit our kind of

31
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.200
one of our iconic buildings. It impacted all 47

32
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.100
major buildings all 167 structures

33
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.800
across our campus 1.2 million

34
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.400
square feet 200 Acres.

35
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.400
and when the tornado hit

36
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.800
We had about a couple hundred students and

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.500
faculty and employees as well

38
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.000
as a couple of homeless folks.

39
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.800
Who were Sheltering at the neighboring?

40
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.200
Church

41
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.000
And that the Pastor said if a tornado

42
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.400
comes run to Riley chapel, and

43
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.700
they'll let you in they'll take care of you.

44
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.600
and sure enough we had a couple of homeless folks and

45
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.500
their dog

46
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.600
in Raleigh with us and God preserved all

47
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.800
lives no lives lost no injuries.

48
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.300
So it's a miracle because we

49
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.700
had four or five major structures or buildings structurally

50
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.300
damaged. And so,

51
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.500
you know looking at

52
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.700
our seniors you got to understand our seniors

53
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.300
started.

54
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.900
In 2019.

55
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.100
freshman year

56
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.500
and if you remember anything about that Academic Year 2019-2020.

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.200
fall 2019

58
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.600
spring 2020. Does anybody remember what

59
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.800
happened in Spring 2020?

60
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.100
Yeah pandemic. Do you remember the world shut down

61
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.600
the wheels fell off the world?

62
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.000
So I think about our seniors.

63
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.200
freshman year pandemic

64
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.100
senior year tornado

65
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.300
So our goal was to get everybody back on

66
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.000
campus to finish the semester.

67
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.000
And have a meaningful graduation and normalcy.

68
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.800
And to do that it took about on

69
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.400
April 20th and 21st.

70
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.600
about 450 volunteers

71
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.900
it took about 200-250 contractors.

72
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.700
We had three or four roofing companies out covering

73
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.900
our roofs drying in before the storms that

74
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.400
were coming on Sunday and Monday.

75
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.300
And we had to fill and dry in

76
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.900
all vertical openings where we're talking about walls blown

77
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.900
out or whether we're talking about wall penetrations or

78
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.500
you know doors

79
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.200
blown off or Windows blow. Now, we

80
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.800
had to do all that and then we had to do the moisture mapping.

81
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.900
Because if you know anything about tornadoes or hurricanes,

82
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.500
they pick up a lot of things in their

83
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.400
wake and a lot of water and you don't know where that water's

84
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.600
been or what it's been over. So it's

85
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.200
categorizes class 3 water which is

86
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.800
like sewage water

87
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.800
So you have to have every space tested.

88
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.300
and clean professionally

89
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.800
For OBU, that's a few thousand rooms

90
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.200
for 5,000 rooms.

91
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.400
And I've got to tell you.

92
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.300
We had teams working around the clock.

93
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.700
And I was able to say to our our entire campus

94
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.900
and our bison.

95
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.800
Nation really

96
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.900
that

97
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.800
Not only would students be allowed to come back to campus they came

98
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.700
started coming back yesterday

99
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.900
We're having in-person classes tomorrow.

100
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.600
Yeah, it's a miracle.

101
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.300
and

102
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.000
why would we do this?

103
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.700
Why would we work so hard for this?

104
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.400
Is it for the buildings? No buildings are

105
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.800
a tool.

106
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.900
Buildings are a resource.

107
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.500
We do it because God has given us the charge to invest in

108
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.800
people.

109
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.400
The next generation of leaders this group right over

110
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.800
here or wherever you are. I think it's over here, right?

111
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.300
This is the generation that's going to be taking care of

112
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.500
us. This is the generation that's going to be our doctors

113
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.600
and our lawyers. This is a generation that's going

114
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.300
to be our cybersecurity experts and we need those more

115
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.200
and more every day.

116
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.600
This is a generation as we found out at OBU who

117
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.500
are going to be our Structural Engineers our civil engineers our

118
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.200
electrical engineers. This is a generation that

119
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.100
is going to make our world tick.

120
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.200
more than that

121
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.100
Under God, this will be the generation.

122
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.100
That leverages all their life.

123
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.600
all for Jesus

124
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.000
That's the potential.

125
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.900
And our vision is to see an

126
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.700
entire generation.

127
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.600
raised up

128
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.800
in every sphere of life and equipped

129
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.100
to go into their world and make a difference for the

130
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.400
Lord.

131
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.600
in every sphere of life

132
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.600
and that's why we did what we did and that's I just

133
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.300
believe that's the potential of this generation.

134
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.800
I believe it.

135
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.500
And you see hints and indicators of this this

136
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.600
generation standing up and saying yeah, that's what

137
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.400
I want to do with my life. I don't want to waste my

138
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.800
life.

139
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.300
Fill the stadium was yesterday. Some of

140
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.000
you may have gone.

141
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.500
My son was in Norman. I mean I'm telling you.

142
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.000
What God's doing right now with this generation is

143
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.900
unbelievable. There was a Revival at Asbury

144
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.200
University.

145
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.500
And it wasn't just at Asbury. Do you know we had Revival

146
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.100
at OBU?

147
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.800
Do you know that we had Saul Revival movements breaking out

148
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.000
all across the nation?

149
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.500
Just the story a few stories at

150
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.100
OBU. Here's the reality. We had folks who

151
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.000
were far from God and yes, we've got plenty of students who are

152
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.000
far from God at OBU.

153
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.600
They're there because the world class education what we're

154
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:02.800
seeing is.

155
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.300
Their light was turned on.

156
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.800
They repented of their sins and they came to Jesus.

157
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.600
And the Lord saved them that happened at

158
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.600
OBU. We saw students laying down things that

159
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.600
they shouldn't have ever picked up in the first place.

160
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.300
And then they picked up the things of God and their

161
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.300
lives were changed.

162
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.000
We saw addictions broken.

163
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.900
suicidal thoughts and ideations broken

164
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.500
There's there's something that's happening in amongst this generation

165
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.000
that we can only pray is of

166
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.800
movement of God.

167
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.200
and one of the things that you find about a movement of God

168
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.200
This is one of those key markers of a movement of God.

169
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.400
There's confession of sin.

170
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.900
And there's not just kind of surface level repentance.

171
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.100
There's deep repentance and a turning back

172
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.100
to God and that's really what I want to talk about today.

173
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.400
I want to talk about dark stars.

174
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.200
Deep Cries and divine grace

175
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.500
and I believe that what happens

176
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.800
when we encounter God's word is our

177
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.400
lives can be changed and then our Our

178
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.200
Lives can be leveraged for the glory of God in this

179
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.800
world. That's what can happen.

180
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.900
And I think that's what God is doing right now.

181
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.400
I don't know why he's doing it the

182
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.100
way he's doing it.

183
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.500
But I don't care God's business is his business. Our responsibility

184
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.900
is just kind of get on the train and hang

185
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.100
on.

186
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.400
So we're looking at the Book

187
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.500
of Joel we work through chapter

188
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.900
one.

189
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.900
Today we're going to work through most in

190
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.300
your English Bibles of chapter 2.

191
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.400
Verses 1 through 27 and then next week. We're

192
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.100
going to go through 28 to 32.

193
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.300
But let's walk through chapter one and

194
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.600
and we're breaking it down into a few sections. So

195
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.400
I'll highlight those for you chapter 2 verse 1

196
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.200
blow a trumpet in Zion sounding alarm on my

197
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.600
Holy Mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for

198
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.700
the day of the Lord is coming. It is

199
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.000
near a day of darkness and Gloom a day

200
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.400
of clouds and thick Darkness. You'll see this language of

201
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.500
the coming day of the Lord begins in verse 1. It'll

202
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.800
show up again in verse 11.

203
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.600
Like Blackness there is spread upon the mountains a great

204
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.500
and powerful people.

205
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.500
They're like has never been before nor will

206
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.500
there again be after them through the years of all generations. What

207
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.300
is about to be described as an invading Army of

208
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:50.900
the North?

209
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.000
Okay, and this invading Army it

210
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.300
kind of sounds like the Locust plague in chapter one,

211
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.100
but this invading Army what happens in

212
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.000
the next few verses is Joel is

213
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.000
describing what the enemy Invasion

214
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.500
looks like.

215
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.500
Verse 3 fire adapt devours

216
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.400
before them and behind them a flame burns. The land

217
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.800
is like the Garden of Eden before them, but behind

218
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.400
them it's a desolate Wilderness and nothing escapes

219
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.400
them their appearances like the

220
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.500
appearance of horses. Like war horses. They run.

221
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.300
As with the rumbling of Chariots they leap on the tops of

222
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.700
mountains like to crackling of a flame of fired

223
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.400
barring the stubble like a powerful Army drawn up

224
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.900
for battle before them. People are in

225
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.100
anguish all faces grow pale.

226
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.500
And this Army says in verse 7 like Warriors, they

227
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.700
charge like soldiers they scale the wall. They March

228
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.300
each on his way. They do not swerve from

229
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.600
their paths. They don't jostle one another each marches

230
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.400
in his path. They burst through the weapons and are not

231
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.300
halted. This is a powerful Army and what you're looking at here is

232
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.500
an actual depiction of what would happen

233
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.200
in an ancient near Eastern onslaught of

234
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.000
a city. It happens this way.

235
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.400
Verse 9 they leap upon the city they run upon the walls. They climb

236
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.500
onto the houses. They enter Through the Windows like a thief

237
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.400
the earthquakes before them the heavens tremble

238
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.500
the Sun and Moon are darkened and here is

239
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.200
where the stars don't shine anymore the

240
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.200
Stars withdraw.

241
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.100
They're shining dark stars.

242
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.200
Look at verse 11 you might want to highlight this or

243
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.400
underline it the Lord utters his voice before his

244
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.500
army. Now. Here's what we need to understand about this

245
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.000
this enemy invasion is not somehow outside

246
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.700
the authority of God.

247
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.400
And that made trouble us and I'll talk about this in just

248
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.600
a minute. But the reality is all the

249
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.000
things that are going on in the world are somehow not

250
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.500
outside the sovereignty or

251
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.800
the Authority or the rule or the rain.

252
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.200
of God

253
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.000
God is strong.

254
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.900
And God is mighty.

255
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.700
In passages like this what we find is because it's

256
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.500
his army. Something is going on here

257
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.400
in the day of the Lord.

258
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.500
God is judging sin.

259
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.100
And it's easy for us in the church to say. Oh all those

260
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.300
Sinners out there God go get them. But here's the reality.

261
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.000
It's his own people.

262
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.200
Who are corrupt from the inside out?

263
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.400
And God true to form and true to

264
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.600
his nature. He said hey, if you rebel against

265
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.800
me people of Israel. Guess what I will discipline you

266
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.100
and that's how we should understand. This. This is a

267
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.200
Divine discipline for sin. How

268
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.500
do we know I would encourage you to go back to your Bibles and read

269
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.900
Deuteronomy 28.

270
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.500
And when you read Deuteronomy 28, you'll understand.

271
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.300
That Israel is not just a free Society to do what they

272
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.300
want to do. God has called them for a purpose and

273
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.500
that purpose is to be a kingdom of priests and a

274
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.600
holy nation so that the world might know

275
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.100
through this particular people.

276
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.000
How God is God of all Nations the god

277
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.100
of Israel the god of the Covenant is

278
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.300
also the cosmic lord of the universe.

279
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.500
And through this particular people the whole world would

280
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.400
be built be blessed. The reason that's important for

281
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.000
you and me.

282
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.200
Is you and I our lives are in that story, too.

283
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.500
When Jesus came who is a child of Israel?

284
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.500
In fact, he's the king of Israel.

285
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.400
When he came he called you and I

286
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.600
for a purpose not just to be free wheeling and

287
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.300
live our lives like we want. Hey, I'm free. I can do whatever

288
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.200
I want. Yes, we can.

289
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.500
But God has called us to something more.

290
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.800
He's called us to his purposes.

291
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.100
He's called us.

292
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.500
To declare the Praises of the one who's called us

293
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.400
out of Darkness into His Marvelous

294
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.700
Light. So the world might know

295
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.800
the beauty the truth the

296
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.500
goodness of our God.

297
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.800
So when it says here in verse 11 that God

298
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.500
is marching before his army.

299
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.300
This enemy invasion is not outside the control of

300
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.000
God in fact.

301
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.200
God said this would happen.

302
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.100
Verse 11. He who executes his

303
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.200
word is powerful. That's God himself for the day of the Lord

304
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.600
is great and very awesome and circle this

305
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.200
phrase who can endure it

306
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.000
will come back to that question in a minute.

307
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.300
Verse 12 we have a turn. This is a new section.

308
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.900
From the focus on the day of the Lord to response

309
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.300
of the day of the Lord yet even

310
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.300
now declares the Lord return to me with all your heart with

311
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.400
fasting with weeping with mourning range your

312
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.500
hearts. Not your garments return to the Lord your God for

313
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.300
his gracious.

314
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.100
And merciful slowed anger abounding instead

315
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.500
fast love and he relents over disaster.

316
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.500
Who knows whether or not turn on relent and leave a blessing

317
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.400
behind him a grain offering a drink offering before the Lord your

318
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.100
God blow the trumpet in Zion consecrate

319
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.500
a fast call us all of assembly gather

320
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.700
the people consecrate the congregation assemble the

321
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.000
elders gather the children even nursing infants let

322
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.400
the bridegroom leave his room in the

323
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.500
bride her tree chamber between the vestibule and

324
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.700
the altar let the priests the Ministers of the Lord weep

325
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.200
and say oh God spare your people.

326
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.800
Oh Lord and make not your heritage or approach a

327
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.700
by word among the Nations. Why should they say among

328
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.100
the people's where is their God?

329
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.200
Here's another section then versus 18 through 27.

330
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.000
verses 18 through 27 focus on the restoration

331
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.800
of God

332
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.300
Then the Lord became jealous for his land and had pity on

333
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.700
his people the Lord answered and said to his people behold.

334
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.400
I am sending you grain wine and oil and

335
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.200
you will be satisfied and I will know more make you

336
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.600
a reproach amongst the Nations. I will

337
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.600
remove the Northern or far from you and drive him into a parched in

338
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.400
desolate land his Vanguard into the Eastern Sea and

339
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.800
his rear guard into the Western Sea and the stench

340
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.500
and foul smell of him. Will rise for he has

341
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.800
done great things.

342
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.000
verse 21

343
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.200
fear not Oh Land be glad and rejoice for the

344
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.600
Lord has done great things fear. Not

345
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.300
you Beasts of the field. I love the fact that God is talking to

346
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.000
animals here.

347
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.000
Maybe that's just me.

348
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.500
He's talked about the animals of the field in chapter one now. He's

349
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.200
saying hey guys, don't be afraid.

350
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.400
It you don't have to be afraid that you're not gonna have any more food. Look what

351
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:04.800
he says.

352
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.400
Fear not you beast of the field for the pastures the

353
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.200
Wilderness or green the tree Bears its fruit the Fig

354

Tree and the vine give their full yield be glad o children

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.100
of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for is giving you

356
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.100
the early Reign for your Vindication. He has poured down

357
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.300
for you abundant rain the early and the

358
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.100
latter rain as before the threshing floor shall be

359
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.700
full of grain the that shall overflow with wine and oil. I

360
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.700
will restore to you the years that the swarming locusts. Hey,

361
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.200
we've got a return of the locusts.

362
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.400
Chapter one right now. It's back. I'll restore

363
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.200
to you the years the swarming Locust has eaten the hopper the

364
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.500
Destroyer the cutter the migrate Army, which I sent

365
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.300
amongst you you shall eat in plenty and

366
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.500
be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God who has

367
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.200
dealt wondrously with you.

368
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.700
And my people shall never be again put to shame.

369
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.000
You shall know.

370
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.500
That I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the

371
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.000
Lord your God and there is no one else and my people shall never

372
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.100
again be put to shame.

373
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.500
So I just want to offer three brief Reflections from this passage

374
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.600
of scripture that will help us understand what it

375
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.200
means to engage our God.

376
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.500
What it means to live well before God, here's the

377
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.700
first thing that we need to realize from this passage.

378
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.800
number one God disrupts a corrupt

379
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.200
world

380
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.600
God disrupts a corrupt world. Now

381
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.100
this goes back to what I was saying about the day of the

382
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.600
Lord you remember in verses 1 and 11 this phrase the

383
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.300
day of the Lord the day of the Lord is imminent. It's

384
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:44.800
near

385
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.200
what we need to understand about the day of the Lord this event.

386
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.100
Where God reveals himself in Justice and mercy, here's what

387
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.800
we need to understand about the day of the Lord.

388
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.800
The day of the Lord is God's way

389
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.700
of saying no.

390
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.800
to the wrongs

391
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.200
that exist in our world.

392
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.800
Now I want you to think about this.

393
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.400
Have you ever had this question man?

394
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.800
What is wrong with this world?

395
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.200
Watch the news or you read a feed

396
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.600
on your on your media on your platform your device.

397
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.800
You read and you just oh my goodness. What is going on?

398
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.200
What is wrong with this world?

399
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.200
I mean this world is jacked up.

400
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.700
What is wrong? This is ridiculous.

401
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.500
And there's this intuitive sense that things are.

402
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.500
Out of joint you remember Hamlet, right?

403
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.500
The world is out of joint o cursed spite.

404
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.500
Well Hamlet knew.

405
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.000
What we do.

406
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.800
Our world is out of joint.

407
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400
Here's the difference though.

408
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.000
What Hamlet did is he said you know?

409
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.300
The world is out of joint occurs his spot that I was ever meant to set

410
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.300
it right. He took the world's problems on

411
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.000
his shoulders and he says I can fix this.

412
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.800
Here's the reality.

413
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.000
What's fundamentally broken and wrong with the world? We can't fix?

414
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.100
Do you know why?

415
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.000
We created the problem.

416
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.400
sin

417
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.800
And the reality is we need a radical intervention of

418
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.100
God.

419
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.100
To set the world, right?

420
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.000
The day of the Lord, is that radical intervention?

421
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.000
Where God shows up?

422
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.500
And says, yeah rape murder

423
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.200
exploitation greed. No, that's not

424
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.000
the order of the day.

425
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.200
No, that's that's not that's not gonna be the way it's

426
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.500
gonna be. I didn't make the world that way that's not

427
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.300
the way it's going to be for eternity disease.

428
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.100
When your body turns against you, no.

429
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.000
It's not always gonna be that way.

430
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.500
The day of the Lord is the radical intervention of

431
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:13.800
God

432
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.700
into the order of today where he sets wrongs, right?

433
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.300
The day of the Lord is an event in which God is revealed in

434
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.900
judgment. And/or salvation for Israel and/or

435
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.100
the Nations and accordance with the justice and the mercy

436
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.300
of God another way to say this.

437
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.500
Is the day of the Lord is the coming of God into the

438
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.400
world for salvation. You might be saying what

439
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.000
are you talking about? He for salvation verses 1

440
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.400
through 11 is all about an enemy invasion. Is

441
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.900
that salvation? Yes.

442
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.500
Why because it's purging the world of

443
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:50.900
sin?

444
00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.700
And anytime God shows up to purge instead of

445
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.000
sin.

446
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.700
It is a creation of firming action. It is

447
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.800
God saying I'm going to wipe out.

448
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.500
the disease

449
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.000
so that renewal and life can come back.

450
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.400
So it's an action of God its salvation into this world,

451
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.400
which also implies judgment.

452
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.500
So that God can instill his reign.

453
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.700
Well, we know about this day of the Lord is that

454
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.000
wrongs are set, right and Injustice is

455
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.100
judged by God the tears of the

456
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.200
world are washed away.

457
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.400
Why because God wipes away the

458
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.100
oppressors?

459
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.200
Only God can do this.

460
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.400
It's a radical intervention of God into our

461
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.600
world.

462
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.400
Now what we see in verses 11 is it's not

463
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.000
far off. In fact, the language of the text says it's great and

464
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.500
it's imminent it's near

465
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.000
These adjectives are repeated throughout the Minor

466
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.700
Prophets that imminent and great and terrible

467
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.100
and near day of the Lord.

468
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.300
It's fearsome.

469
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.100
And it's especially fearsome for those who have

470
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.100
turned their backs on God.

471
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:07.900
Why?

472
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.200
For those who fear the lord the day of the Lord is

473
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.300
a day of Refuge.

474
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.300
But for those who rebel against the lord, it's a

475
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.600
day of Terror.

476
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.600
So

477
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.500
in verses 2 all the way through 10, we

478
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.000
have this picture of the enemy invasion.

479
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.300
And the enemy Invasion follows what you would expect when

480
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.100
you think about ancient near Eastern battle plans surrounding the

481
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.100
series City laying Siege to

482
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.600
it. And then at the invasion itself going through the windows

483
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.100
and the doorways and how those would all

484
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.700
be set within the city walls of the city.

485
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.400
And so the question then arises in

486
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.200
verse 12. Oh my goodness who is

487
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.000
going to be able to endure in the day of

488
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.400
the Lord?

489
00:24:59.600 --> 00:24:59.900
Who?

490
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.400
Well, I'll get to that in just a second. But here's the

491
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.300
first thing that I want us to really grab hold of

492
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:08.700
from.

493
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.300
This picture of dark stars. And for those

494
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.800
kinds of those of you who are thinking gosh are

495
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.200
really the sky and then everything going to

496
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.300
turn dark and the star is gonna turn dark in the sun and moon

497
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.400
is what what any time in the Old Testament or

498
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.500
the New Testament when you have God stepping from

499
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.000
Heaven to Earth to intervene and set things right?

500
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.900
the World Turns topsy-turvy

501
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.700
why creation responds to its creator?

502
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.100
And so what you're seeing here is creation responding to

503
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.400
the Creator when he comes to vindicate

504
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.000
the righteous and judge the wicked.

505
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.800
What can we see from this passage?

506
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.900
particularly verses 1 through 12

507
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.000
listen to me.

508
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.000
Here's what you need to take to the bank. And so do I.

509
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.600
The wrongs of our world will not always be normal.

510
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.600
Injustice will not always be

511
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.200
normal

512
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.800
We won't have a need when God comes near

513
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.200
and makes all things new we won't have a need

514
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.300
for a district attorney.

515
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.200
If you're a district attorney in the room, we're grateful for you.

516
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.800
But there's going to come a time.

517
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.100
When you're not going to need a prosecutor.

518
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.000
You're not going to need a human judge. Why?

519
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.400
Because the Divine judge will have set all things, right.

520
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.300
Injustice won't be the order of the day because God will wipe it

521
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.800
clean. That's what the day of the Lord.

522
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.200
shares

523
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.200
Now, why is this important? I'll tell you why let me

524
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.800
get real personal.

525
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.300
City of Shawnee the tornado that we just

526
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.600
experienced went straight through the city. I'm part of a leadership planning to

527
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.600
get the city back not just normal, but

528
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.200
thinking forward about where our future is

529
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.600
and where we need to go. And what's the opportunity here

530
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.600
again? Miraculously, no lives lost no injuries.

531
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.300
But we were in this big kind of war room

532
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.500
kind of planning meeting on Friday. And one

533
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.500
of the things that came up with all these subcommittees and

534
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.200
you know planning groups. We need to make sure

535
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.000
that we have a committee that addresses fraud.

536
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.300
Now you might be thinking well, why would you I mean we're Emergency Services.

537
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.400
Okay, you know clean up

538
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.200
and economic development. Okay.

539
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.700
fraud

540
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:43.700
yeah.

541
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.700
You know you had folks.

542
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.500
Not many but you had folks.

543
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.100
Going to Residents who

544
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.500
had trees on their houses.

545
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.600
And with charging them four to 14,000 dollars

546
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.300
to remove a tree.

547
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.600
When Samaritan's Purse and Oklahoma Baptist disaster relief

548
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.400
are doing it for free.

549
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.500
Now, what do you say about that?

550
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.500
I understand tree relief and all that is expensive I

551
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:14.900
get that.

552
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.200
But what we saw amongst some Bad actors in

553
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.800
our society.

554
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.600
They were exploiting.

555
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.300
The vulnerable to make a

556
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.400
buck.

557
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.000
now

558
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.900
that gets in my nerves.

559
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.500
That flat out makes me mad.

560
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.200
And I look at that and I think man these people have been through so much.

561
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.700
And now we have to deal with this.

562
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.500
God is this how you made the world the day of the Lord says no.

563
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.700
God didn't make the world for that.

564
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.200
That is wrong. And listen to me.

565
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.800
There is in this world such a thing as right.

566
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.100
and wrong

567
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.200
and the beautiful thing is it's not terribly ambiguous.

568
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.600
Why?

569
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.000
God is showed us. What is right and what is

570
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:13.300
wrong?

571
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.900
And you might call me old-fashioned or antediluvian.

572
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.900
I am a PhD I'll use that word, right?

573
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.400
You might think me too narrow too

574
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.000
small minded, but here's what I would say.

575
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.300
Why is it that we recognize when things are

576
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:34.600
wrong?

577
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.400
Because intuitively God has built

578
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.600
the world according to a grain of the universe.

579
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.400
Where there is right and there is wrong and when

580
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.500
we see exploitation, we know that's wrong when we

581
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.800
see rape or murder. We know that's wrong. We see greed uncontrolled

582
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.500
greed. We know that

583
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.200
is wrong why because it is

584
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.400
wrong.

585
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.600
The day of the Lord reminds us when God turns

586
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.300
the lights off.

587
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.100
Because he's coming to intervene. Here's what

588
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:09.700
we need to understand.

589
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.100
The wrongs of this world won't always be normal

590
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.600
God's gonna set it, right?

591
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.600
You can take it to the bank.

592
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.300
The day of the Lord says no to the wrongs of

593
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:25.600
our world.

594
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.800
And I want you to think about this.

595
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.500
The day of the Lord is a concept that sets a pattern for

596
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.300
how God intervenes in our world the day

597
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.100
of the Lord shows up in the Minor Prophets. It shows up in the book of

598
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.100
Isaiah. It shows up amongst other places, but you know what

599
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.000
happens when Jesus comes in 2000

600
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.400
years ago and he appears and and

601
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.600
born and he ministers he

602
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.700
dies on a cross.

603
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.200
his victoriously resurrected, you know what that

604
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.500
is described as

605
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.600
the intervention of God in the world

606
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:02.900
today

607
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.600
remember in Matthew what happens to the

608
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.200
world when Jesus dies on that cross?

609
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.700
the sky turns dark

610
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.700
There's earthquakes why.

611
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.700
because creation response

612
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600
to its creator

613
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.300
Sin, and wrong is not the

614
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.400
order of our day.

615
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.700
The New Testament recognized when Jesus came and

616
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.400
when he's coming again, it's going to be the day

617
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.100
of the Lord.

618
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.400
The New Testament follows the Old Testament pattern it

619
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.300
when God shows up.

620
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.600
It's a day of judgment and salvation

621
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.000
at the appearing of Jesus our Messiah.

622
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.500
So the day of the Lord in the New Testament is transformed

623
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.400
into as Paul likes to describe it or

624
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.200
others like to describe it the day of Jesus Christ.

625
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.400
or the day of Christ in Philippians 1 or

626
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:01.800
2

627
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.600
or in 1st Corinthians verse 1 chapter 1

628
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.400
verse 8. It is the day of our Lord Jesus Christ would

629
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.300
Jesus would come again? The thought of

630
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.500
the New Testament writers was that he would have two functions number

631
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:14.800
one?

632
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.300
He would judge the world and would pronounce judgment on

633
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.400
human beings who rebelled against him. We know this from acts

634
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.200
17. We know this from second Timothy 4. We know

635
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.700
this all through the New Testament. Jesus is

636
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.800
going to come to judge the quick and the dead.

637
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.200
second

638
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.900
As Savior Jesus is going to transform our bodies vindicate

639
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.200
the righteous and make all things new. That's what

640
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200
Jesus is going to do.

641
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.600
So when you're talking about the day of the Lord Jesus Christ is

642
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.600
the same function God Appears in judgment and salvation.

643
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.600
He's going to vindicate the righteous and

644
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.700
he's going to judge the wicked.

645
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.100
He's going to say no to the wrongs of our world.

646
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.400
And he's gonna make everything right?

647
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.000
That's the day of the Lord.

648
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.500
The day of the Lord tells us the wrongs of our world will be set to

649
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.200
rights and God in Christ will make all things

650
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:11.500
new.

651
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.000
But that brings us back to verse 12 doesn't this is the second

652
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.200
Reflection from this passage?

653
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.500
Remember verse 12. What does it say?

654
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.600
Who can endure it?

655
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.800
Who can endure the day of the Lord?

656
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.300
Well, that's where we get the Deep Cries of the

657
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.500
title of our talk today.

658
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.500
The second Reflection from this passage is God desires

659
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.900
our repentance and prayer.

660
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.200
When you look at verse 2 chapter 2 verses 12

661
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.000
through 14, you see this language the language of return return.

662
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.800
God desires our repentance.

663
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.800
Look at the text. It says get even now declares

664
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.600
the Lord return to me with all your heart with fasting

665
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.300
with weeping with mourning ringe your hearts. Not your

666
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.700
garments return to the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful

667
00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.200
slow to anger abounding and steadfast

668
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.100
love and he relents over disaster. Now, some will say

669
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.600
well, there's no real explicit mention of sin. So this probably isn't

670
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.500
talking about repentance. Well, actually it is

671
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.300
The reason is there's probably five good reasons

672
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.800
why this is really talking about repentance, even though no explicit

673
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.600
sin has been mentioned number one.

674
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.300
Anytime you're talking about this Locust or enemy Invasion. It

675
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.500
reminds us of Deuteronomy and Leviticus and

676
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.200
Covenant curse. So that when we

677
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.400
see or hear Locust plague the memory is oh, yeah that's happening

678
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.000
Covenant curse for Israel. The second reason is

679
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.800
because the language and Joel 115

680
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.900
alas or in Hebrew. It's aha right?

681
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.100
Not like aha Eureka found it,

682
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.300
but that's more what it's going on.

683
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.500
This indicates surprise not

684
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.800
surprised but rather Terror at God's judgment over

685
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.900
sin in other texts in the Old Testament.

686
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.600
You also see in chapter in Chapter

687
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.400
2 here this language that shows up in 12

688
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.300
to 14 is The Exodus 34 language

689
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.200
and it indicates God's covenant of commitment

690
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.500
to his people after they've committed sin and I'll

691
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.400
unpack that in just a minute.

692
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.700
Which means that after God's people repent?

693
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.600
of sin

694
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.000
God reaffirms his Covenant character with them.

695
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.500
Fourth reason the language here is

696
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.800
very similar to what you find in Jeremiah and

697
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.200
Jeremiah is always talking about repentance. So

698
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.100
again, just looking at cortex. We're drawing

699
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.500
from the Old Testament the language that he's

700
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.400
talking about is probably repentance.

701
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.000
And then very clearly in verse 13 who knows

702
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.500
God May relent over disaster that

703
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.200
language that phrase in verse 13 relenting over

704
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.500
disaster and Punishment and sin is the

705
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.500
same language used in the Book of Jonah.

706
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.500
to describe what happened to the ninevites after

707
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.400
They repented of their sin.

708
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.400
Jonah was upset about that. He was kind of a racist if

709
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.600
you want to know the honest truth.

710
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.800
So all those reasons tell us that what's going

711
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.800
on here is repentance. God desires

712
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.800
repentance and verse 13

713
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.800
pictures that in a very interesting way.

714
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.200
Look at what it says. It says ring your

715
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.700
hearts.

716
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.300
Not your garments not have you ever thought about

717
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.200
what that would mean Rend your hearts that mean you reach inside

718
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.600
yourself and rip your heart open.

719
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.700
First of all, that's gruesome.

720
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.900
We don't want to do that. I wouldn't encourage that.

721
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.500
No, it's a metaphor.

722
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.500
And the metaphor works because in the

723
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.100
ancient world whenever catastrophe catastrophe with

724
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.400
strike or God's people were supposed to repent they

725
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.500
would often strip and rip their

726
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.200
their clothes and they would sit in

727
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.000
ashes and throw ashes on themselves to show their repentance.

728
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.700
Now what's interesting here, is that rending your

729
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.600
hearts and not your garments tells us that there

730
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.900
might have been some people who were doing some showy action.

731
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.500
They were ripping their shirt. They were ripping their cloak. They

732
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.400
were rending their garments and

733
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.200
probably throwing ashes on themselves and sitting on the ground

734
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:24.400
and

735
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.300
a bit making a big show.

736
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.300
But what God doesn't want from us.

737
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.900
Is a big external show.

738
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.900
He wants inner transformation of the

739
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.100
heart.

740
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.200
Now some of us in this room know what it's

741
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.700
like whenever in our we're talking to God, maybe you're bargaining with

742
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.400
God this morning.

743
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.200
Maybe you're saying Lord. If you just make this deal

744
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.400
go through. I'll say 50 Hail Marys. I'll give all my

745
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.400
money to the poor. I'll come to church. I'll be

746
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.100
a good boy. I'll be a good girl. I'll do the right thing. I'll be

747
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.600
a good person. I won't hurt anybody. I won't defraud

748
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.500
anybody. I'll do this. I'll do that. I'll do the other and really

749
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.500
what we're doing is bargaining with God on our terms.

750
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.000
Not God's terms our terms.

751
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.200
God we're in a business deal and I'll do this if you do

752
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:17.300
that.

753
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.800
That's not what this is talking about.

754
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.400
There's no external show that we can put on for God

755
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.100
for us to impress him.

756
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.300
What God wants who can endure the day of the Lord what God

757
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.700
wants is inner transformation of the heart Rend

758
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.800
your hearts.

759
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.500
Not your garments now some of us in this generation. I

760
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.300
work with college students every day. And

761
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.100
this is the kind of place where

762
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.800
some of our our College folks might say well God

763
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.600
didn't care what we do. God just

764
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.200
cares about our heart.

765
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.400
You know, I didn't care what I do.

766
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.200
I mean, I love him. We're good.

767
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.900
me and God

768
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.200
good.

769
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.100
Here's the flip side what I'm saying

770
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.200
about show right? God didn't care about what we

771
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.100
do. Yes, he does.

772
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.500
Why because our actions oftentimes reveal

773
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.300
our hearts?

774
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.400
So if you come to church on a Sunday.

775
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.100
That's great.

776
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.700
That's wonderful.

777
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.100
But it's not so you can check a box and say you're a

778
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.100
good person or a good Christian.

779
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.200
The reason we come here.

780
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.500
is because from the deepest core of

781
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.400
our being

782
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.600
God in Christ has transformed Our

783
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:42.800
Lives.

784
00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.400
And our desire is to worship Him.

785
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.000
And what happens when we worship him and have that

786
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.200
inner transformation of the heart all of a

787
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.600
sudden life seems change.

788
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.000
I'll never forget whenever I was a

789
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.100
One of a my son played Pop Warner football

790
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.100
when we lived in Wake Forest North Carolina, and I was one of

791
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.400
the coaches for my son's Pop Warner football team and and it

792
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.300
was a great team. Actually a lot of those kids went D1

793
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.500
playing the one I see him

794
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.700
on Saturdays great great kids.

795
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.100
And one of the kids on that team.

796
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.300
We got to know his parents a little bit and his parents

797
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.300
looked great on

798
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.900
the outside beautiful wonderful cool people from

799
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.100
New York.

800
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.300
moved down to Wake Forest

801
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.300
and you know Jill and I you know, we're hanging on

802
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.600
by a thin thread most of the time in life. And so we're like look

803
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.000
at Adam and Jill says to

804
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.200
the our friend Christy. She said that you guys are

805
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.200
unbelievable. You guys look like you've got it all together. I don't know how you

806
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.300
do it. Are you have a faith Journey or

807
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.200
anything? No. No, we don't, you know.

808
00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.900
Wow, that's amazing. I don't know how you do it.

809
00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.200
And the more we got to know them the more we saw

810
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.700
there was another story behind the story that that was there

811
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.900
on the outside, right?

812
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.600
If you were to kind of relate this to something like be real

813
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.500
or something like that.

814
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.600
They needed a real

815
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.700
be real for their life.

816
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.700
Because what was going on on the outside was airbrushed and

817
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.000
photoshopped and everything else.

818
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.200
What was really going on in their family was pretty pretty

819
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:26.800
horrific.

820
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.200
And through the process of about a year. We got

821
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:31.800
to know them.

822
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.400
Through the process of about two years. We saw God do a

823
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.800
miracle in their life. God save the husband.

824
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.400
Then he saved the son.

825
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.200
And he saved the daughter or the wife and then

826
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.000
the other son.

827
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.600
And the reality is their life was radically transformed

828
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.500
and so my friend Doug. He said

829
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.600
he's I don't I don't know how to process this what

830
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.700
I'm not tell you. I'm like, okay.

831
00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.200
He said, you know, I was watching the show

832
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.700
on HBO.

833
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.400
And I've been watching the show for years. I think it was something like Game

834
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:05.700
of Thrones.

835
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.800
And he said they're the scene came up.

836
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.300
and I just got this real uneasy feeling

837
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.500
I shouldn't be watching this.

838
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.500
And I said really?

839
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.000
He said yeah, what happened?

840
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.400
I said I'll tell you what happened Doug. The Lord has gotten

841
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.500
hold of your life and he's changing your desires and it's changing your actions.

842
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.700
And sure enough seeing the life transformation in

843
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.200
that family through the powerful work of

844
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.000
God is unbelievable.

845
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.500
Why because God doesn't just care about our hearts.

846
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.600
Our hearts then bleed over into our hands.

847
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.000
God cares about our hearts

848
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.400
and our hands it's not our hearts, but not our hands.

849
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.500
It's not our hands but not our hearts God cares about

850
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.900
both but it's the right order, isn't it?

851
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.100
Rend your hearts not your garments

852
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:07.300
Don't just make it external show of things if your heart's not in it likewise listen.

853
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.300
If you know you say your heart's in it, it better results

854
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.400
in something in your life.

855
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.100
Think about Jesus, right?

856
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.800
Do you remember what happened when he visited Zacchaeus?

857
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.700
Jesus didn't say Zacchaeus. I'll come to your house if

858
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.300
You give all the money to the poor and you you know,

859
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.200
give money back with interest with those

860
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.400
who you've defrauded. He didn't say that did he?

861
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.000
What did he see? He sees Zacchaeus and he says Zacchaeus. I'm

862
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.700
gonna have a meal at your house today.

863
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.500
And Zacchaeus went and joyfully received him.

864
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.000
and then after he encount

865
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.900
ers this I'm gonna give all my money the poor or whatever defraud all

866
00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.800
those people defrauded. I'm gonna give them back with interest.

867
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.600
When you look at Jesus, it's never a well.

868
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.400
I'll love you if

869
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.400
it's just I love you.

870
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.900
I want to change your life.

871
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.600
I want to forgive you of your sins.

872
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.800
And then when that happens your life

873
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:18.800
changes.

874
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.200
God cares about our hearts and our hands.

875
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.400
This phrase rinsed your hearts not your

876
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.800
garments return to me return to me. All this

877
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.000
language is telling us that inner transformation

878
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.400
of our hearts brings out outward devotion.

879
00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.800
So why do we go serve the poor?

880
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.300
Not to be good little boys and girls.

881
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.900
Because Christ compels us.

882
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.700
the love of Christ compels us

883
00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.500
Why are we ethical in our business?

884
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.400
Not so that we can Pat ourselves at the back and say well

885
00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.500
I'm so much better than you.

886
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.500
No.

887
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.700
Because the love of Christ compels us

888
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.000
it motivates our action.

889
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.400
What happens when we Rend our hearts what happens when

890
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.200
we experience that inner transformation?

891
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.400
Verse 13 tells us this covenantal language. You

892
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.300
see in Joel 13. We see God as gracious

893
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.800
and merciful slow to anger abounding and steadfast love relenting

894
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.300
over punishment. Do you know that language?

895
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.300
God's people already know it comes from Exodus chapter 34 verses

896
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.500
6 and 7. You can see it there on the screen where God is

897
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.200
merciful that language the underlying

898
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.100
words in the figure that you see here on

899
00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.600
the screen. Abounding is steadfast love for thousands for giving iniquity

900
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.000
transgression and sin that underline language

901
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.600
indicates. What's not real? What's

902
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.700
not reiterated in Joel's reception of The Exodus Passage?

903
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.000
Or we see here and this is interesting.

904
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.400
This language in Exodus 34 shows

905
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.200
up after God's people have experienced that

906
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.600
inner transformation. What happens is God shows up as a

907
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.400
god whose gracious and merciful.

908
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.300
Slow to anger abounding and steadfast love and mercy.

909
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.400
What you find here?

910
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.800
Is God in Exodus is all

911
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.400
of those things Joel picks that language up as

912
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.500
gracious merciful slow to anger relenting over

913
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.800
punishment. This is who God is.

914
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.200
The phrase relenting over punishment as I've said is

915
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.800
unique to Joel.

916
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.500
It's about mourning and fasting coupled with this turn

917
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.800
to God repentance and repentance in

918
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.400
prayer. If you turn to God in prayer

919
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.300
and fasting and weeping, then you'll see who God

920
00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.000
is. Who is he that

921
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.400
prayer repentance

922
00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.400
prayer is about relationship through prayer. God becomes our source

923
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.400
of Hope in a very real way in prayer. We find God Alone

924
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.900
provides possibility of transformation. This

925
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.800
is who God is

926
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.500
in his grace and in his Mercy

927
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.400
God responds to our repentance when we

928
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.700
Rend our hearts not our garments.

929
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.200
God transforms us and delivers.

930
00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.800
When God's people pray from the heart, we see God transform the

931
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.300
inner person and the world around us.

932
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.400
The world around us. Yeah, how do we know this goes to our third reflection?

933
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.700
Third Reflection from this passage is God delivers mercy

934
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.300
and renewal.

935
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.400
Is God Only a God who wants to judge and condemn?

936
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400
No, he's not.

937
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.400
In this passage particularly verses 18 through 27,

938
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.500
we see that God turns our tragedies into triumphs

939
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.700
Look at the screen here, you'll see all the tragedies listed

940
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.000
in chapter one. Check this out. You see this all the

941
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.400
tragedies of chapter one Locust versus

942
00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.400
one four Army one six. No

943
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.300
new wine or grain or

944
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.300
oil one five.

945
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.000
10 or 18 there's no offering or libation

946
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.800
offering to the Lord. There's a morning land. There's a

947
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.800
groaning Beast. You can see it withered land withered crops

948
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.400
drought mourning people Joy is all dried

949
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.200
up. That's the tragedy that we see in God's people

950
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.300
But is that the end of the story?

951
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:27.900
No.

952
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.800
Look at the Divine triumphs. God works on Israel's

953
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.100
behalf in verses 18 through 27.

954
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.200
Where before there were locusts now, there is a restoration from the

955
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.400
Locust plague in Chapter 2 where there's an army

956
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.400
verse two verse 20 God drives

957
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.200
the northerner way where there was no grain wine or

958
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.200
oil now. There's a restoration of grain up wine and

959
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.600
oil where there was no offering or libation. Now,

960
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.200
there's abundance of grain wine and

961
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.900
oil where there was a morning land. Now, you have this language fear not.

962
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.300
Oh soil where there were groaning

963
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.400
beasts. Now, there are fear not obese to the field where there

964
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.500
were withered land and dry crops. Now, there's a fertile land

965
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.300
where there was drought. There's early and latter rain.

966
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.100
where there are morning people

967
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.700
Now there's joy and no more shame. Do you see?

968
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.700
What the text is telling us?

969
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.500
When we repent when we turn to the Lord, we trust

970
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.900
him when we find our shelter in him. This

971
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.000
is what happens God turns our

972
00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.400
tragedies into triumphs and

973
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.500
only God can do that.

974
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.300
Yes.

975
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.000
I've seen this personally.

976
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.400
in the past week through pain and

977
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.000
a lot of confusion

978
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.400
you can see pictures there on the screen of

979
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.000
What our campus looked like it was?

980
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.600
It was bad. You know that was our business center

981
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.100
a wall was blown out there. You can

982
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.200
see Raley Chapel at Rayleigh. Chapel was

983
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.400
significantly impacted now that's patched up.

984
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:14.500
You can see or even our apartment complexes. You

985
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.600
can see that they've been impacted

986
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.900
and then Shawnee Hall our oldest

987
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:23.000
and most significant academic building Shawnee

988
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.100
Hall was impacted. Here's what she needed to know.

989
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.300
As I began this message listen to me class is starting

990
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.700
with students on campus on Monday.

991
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.900
Now if God can do that in a week

992
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.100
What do you think God can do in your life in a month?

993
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.600
We think God can do in your life in a year.

994
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.100
As you live a life of devotion or repentance to

995
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:46.200
him.

996
00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.900
Who can endure the day of the Lord? I'll tell you who.

997
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.200
those who run their hearts

998
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.700
those who repent of their sin and those who trust in

999
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.800
the renewal of God. See God is good.

1000
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.900
God is merciful.

1001
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.700
And what we need to understand about the God that we worship.

1002
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.500
We see this in Jesus. He likes to take Wayward

1003
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500
things and bring them home.

1004
00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.100
He likes to take broken things and mend them.

1005
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.500
He likes to take us battered.

1006
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.200
And make us better. Why?

1007
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.700
So then we'll know who God is.

1008
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:22.800
I got to tell you.

1009
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.200
Is very personal?

1010
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.400
I'm a

1011
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:29.900
exhausted

1012
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.300
confused. I don't understand.

1013
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.200
But this is what I can tell you.

1014
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.700
I know God better today.

1015
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.000
Because of the triumphs that he brings through tragedy.

1016
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.900
I know him today better.

1017
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.400
Than I would isn't it interesting at the end of this section here versus 25

1018
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.200
through 27, you know the language that

1019
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:52.600
shows up.

1020
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:55.900
Then you will know.

1021
00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.400
Then you will know.

1022
00:51:59.200 --> 00:51:59.900
That I'm God.

1023
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.200
I'm in the midst of Israel.

1024
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.800
A lot of times we want to escape the hard things of life.

1025
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.500
You don't have to escape them.

1026
00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:14.100
Walk through them with God and discover. He

1027
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.400
is all we need.

1028
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.900
dark stars Deep Cries

1029
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:22.600
divine grace
