1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.400
Good evening.

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.200
As evening thank you

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.700

we would love to be able to get back with you and say welcome. So tonight

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.300
we continue our series on what

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.500
is our role as the culture begins

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.300
to change in a manner that we don't completely see

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.200
where it's going or we don't always agree where it's going but tonight

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.400
is refreshing night because you're

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.200
gonna get to meet some people that frankly I'm kind

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.900
of falling in love with these people and my my

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.600
part here is just to remind us that we understand

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.400
that we are created in the image and likeness

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
of God which gives us incalculable worth in

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.200
the side of all and so everyone should be treated as if they

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.300
are created in the image of God because

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.400
They are.

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.400
And as soldiers of Jesus Christ in the Gospel Kingdom

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
of the Gospel, we are here to

25
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.500
Bear one another's burdens. We're here to come alongside one

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.200
another and to encourage and support one another and we're going

27
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.500
to learn better how to do that tonight. And so we're going to start with

28
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.400
one of our elders you guys know, Joe Williams and Joe's

29
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.200
got a little testimony and a challenge for us

30
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
before we start our panel discussion. So Joe.

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.300
Thanks, Phil.

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.600
Again, my name is Joe Williams. I'm an elder here. I've been

33
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.000
an elder since 2005. I was

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.100
a sophomore in high school.

35
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.500
When I heard that Martin Luther King Jr.

36
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.900
Had just been killed.

37
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.900
I was with one of my high school teachers.

38
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.100
Whose comment was well one less troublemaker?

39
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500
I think I agreed with him.

40
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.300
For too many years.

41
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.500
My attitude has been I'm not a racist.

42
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.600
So it's not my problem.

43
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.700
The Civil Rights bill was passed in 1964.

44
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.300
And it's illegal to discriminate.

45
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.200
So wouldn't you say then that our society is appropriately colorblind.

46
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.000
I guess I thought that racial issues were pretty much

47
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.800
overblown.

48
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
And that black people just need to chill

49
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.800
out.

50
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.200
But a few years ago, I was talking to a young pastor.

51
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.500
A friend he was young man originally from Tennessee who had

52
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.600
relocated up to Minneapolis.

53
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.300
And as a result of the racial tension in the Minneapolis area, he went

54
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.700
on a civil rights tour.

55
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.800
of the South with a group of pastors

56
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.500
these pastors were half about half black

57
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.100
and about half of them were white.

58
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.100
I asked him how that went. And he said

59
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.400
it really changed his perspective. And I said well,

60
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.300
how's that what stood out?

61
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.800
He mentioned that they had a stop. It stopped

62
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.400
at several places through the South.

63
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.600
But they stopped at the 16th Street Baptist Church in

64
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.300
Birmingham, Alabama.

65
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.500
We're in 1963 a bomb went off.

66
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.100
And four black girls were killed.

67
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.500
He related that as they stood around the memorial.

68
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.400
He was stunned as the black pastors.

69
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.500
began to weep

70
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.800
see it was personal for them.

71
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.700
In a way, that was really eye opening for my friend.

72
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.200
My friend told me that he realized that those weren't for little black

73
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.500
girls.

74
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.600
They were four little girls who were killed whose

75
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.000
only crime was going to Sunday school.

76
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.900
That made it personal to me.

77
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.900
Because I was a dad who took little girls to

78
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.300
Sunday school.

79
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.000
And made it personal to me for the first time.

80
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.200
And as it looked into it, I learned that no one was arrested for

81
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.600
that crime until 45 years. Later.

82
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.600
and so

83
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
my mind got to Reeling I said well ask my

84
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.900
friend. How could I learn to understand this shared personal

85
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.500
experience?

86
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.200
of our black friends

87
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.500
He mentioned a book by Pastor John Perkins.

88
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.700
Let Justice roll down.

89
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.700
I recommend that book it's on a resource list that we have there at

90
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.900
the back.

91
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.300
There's a man I work for work with from Kansas City. He's

92
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.200
a black gentleman who owns car dealerships. He's

93
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.100
founded Ministries.

94
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.500
He's a Bible vocational pastor.

95
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.900
He was born up in Guthrie.

96
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.400
We're open Wichita graduated from Langston University.

97
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.300
And he shared with a small group of us a few years ago.

98
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.400
At a time when he was he's really distraught over

99
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.800
ongoing racial violence.

100
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.700
He said I was one of the first black police officers

101
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.500
in Wichita.

102
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.300
He said I'm not a big guy.

103
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.300
So I know how scary it is for a policeman to confront a 240

104
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.300
pound violent drunk who's been beaten on

105
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.800
his wife.

106
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.200
And he said but and I know what it is as a black man to get

107
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.200
stopped and thrown up on the hood of a car for no good reason at all.

108
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.400
He said we talk about reconciliation, but

109
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.700
How do we reconcile that which was never consiled in

110
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.100
the first place?

111
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.500
Well, the answer of course is through Jesus Christ. Amen.

112
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.800
As a Believer I am precious in a sight.

113
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.300
And you are too.

114
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.700
And so are our black brothers and sisters.

115
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.600
We Are All Made In His Image

116
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.000
It raises questions in my mind.

117
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.300
Should I be concerned to learn?

118
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400
that a child born in a particular zip code in Oklahoma City

119
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.500
as an 18-year shorter life expectancy.

120
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.800
Than a child born in another zip code in Oklahoma City.

121
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.700
Should I be concerned if a great majority?

122
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.200
Of children in that neighborhood can't read by the time they're in

123
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.700
the third grade.

124
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.000
And may never learn to read.

125
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.200
Am I supposed to do something about that?

126
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.500
Or we supposed to do something about it.

127
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.300
Well, Jesus say

128
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.100
Matthew 5 Matthew 25:40

129
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.900
says in the king is Jesus.

130
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.000
We'll answer them.

131
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.600
Truly I say to you.

132
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.300
As you did it to one of the least of these my brothers

133
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.300
you did it to me.

134
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.400
I'm really excited.

135
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.200
That we're joined here this evening by some folks who are doing

136
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.000
something about it.

137
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.400
And I pray as we sit at their feet tonight that

138
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.600
we learn from them.

139
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.700
So I'll turn it back over to Phil to do the next introduction. Pardon

140
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.000
me julita prayer. Oh.

141
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.500
Heavenly Father

142
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.600
we just come before you.

143
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.400
knowing that we fall short

144
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.500
knowing that

145
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.800
you love.

146
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.600
all people

147
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.200
and that we are called.

148
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.600
challenged to do the same

149
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.400
and father and knowing that we are blessed.

150
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.300
As we reach across the perceived boundaries that

151
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.500
seem to divide us.

152
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.300
so father we ask tonight that you would just open our hearts

153
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.200
to to hear things that may be hard to hear

154
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.400
hear things that may be exciting to hear father but

155
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.500
things that will

156
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.000
Line with the gospel.

157
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.300
For that is the answer. You are the answer

158
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.100
dear Jesus. Thank you in Jesus name I pray

159
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.400
amen.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.400
John Mark Hart the pastor and have him share a

182
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.200
little about their story and then he'll introduces a comrades.

183
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.800
I want to first. Thank my friend Joe for what

184
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.400
you just shared brother.

185
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.900
I've known Joe. I can't remember when we met but for a number of years. I

186
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.800
hadn't heard you share all that story and

187
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.300
I think on talking about some of

188
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.500
the difficult challenging issues that we're talking about tonight you going first?

189
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.000
And sharing with humility and honesty about your own

190
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.100
journey is just so powerful.

191
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.200
And I've been reading in James lately, which says

192
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.300
God opposes the proud but give grace to the humble. Do

193
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.900
you feel like we need some more humble in America?

194
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.100
and there's a lot of Shame there's a

195
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.600
lot of anger but part of how we do things in the body of Christ James one also

196
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.300
says let every person be quick to

197
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.400
hear slow to speak slow to

198
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.300
anger and I think just the opportunity now to embrace

199
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:36.700
the

200
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.700
a humility of listening humility of speaking even sharing weaknesses and

201
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.500
growth and your own blind spots is awesome. James

202
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.100
also says confess your sins to one another and pray for

203
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.300
each other so that you may be healed.

204
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.400
So that just sharing honestly about your own journey and everyone listening is

205
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.500
great. That's great. Where you start Joseph? Thank you for sharing with vulnerability.

206
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.000
So I'm supposed to tell a little bit about our story Redemption Church

207
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.300
is the church. We work on in South Oklahoma City we and

208
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.200
I have several generations of family history

209
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.200
in South OKC.

210
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.300
and

211
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.000
my dad grew up in South OKC went to

212
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.600
Grant High School and didn't know the Lord when he was a

213
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.800
senior in high school. He was struggling spiritually and

214
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.500
getting in to a lot of trouble and and just didn't

215
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.900
know God and was trying to figure out what life was about and actually one

216
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.200
night. He went out to buy drugs, but it was too cold

217
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.300
so he couldn't find anyone in and turn on the TV there was

218
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.700
a preacher you may have heard of named Billy Graham preaching on TV and saying

219
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.200
what he always says Jesus died on the cross for your sins and you

220
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.200
must be born again and my dad was like that's what I need. I need forgiveness. I

221
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.200
need a new start and that was the big what led to

222
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.300
me getting to grow up in a home that was filled with the Gospel of Jesus

223
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.300
Christ and many many years later.

224
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.000
I was at OU and through a long series of events. I went

225
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.500
to the whole thing since the Lord was calling me to

226
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.800
plant lead to team that was planning a church and felt

227
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.300
called to do inner city Ministry work.

228
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.800
I'd been doing that kind of I'd grown up in the inner city in Texas and a

229
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.200
multiracial environment and had been doing

230
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.600
that kind of been a part of that kind of ministry most of my life and felt called

231
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.600
to do that work and we're hoping that inner

232
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.600
city missions and Ministry preaching the gospel making disciples loving

233
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.400
our neighbors could be something not only that we do locally but

234
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.700
a way that we train people and that environment to go to the Nations learn

235
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.000
how to do missions locally in order

236
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.300
to learn how to do missions globally and felt like

237
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.100
the Lord was directing to Oklahoma City teamed up

238
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.300
with Chansey. He was one of eight people that came and helped us plant at that time. It was Christ

239
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.600
Community Church. We'll talk about the name change in a second, but

240
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.300
Um felt directed to a specific neighborhood and South

241
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.300
Oklahoma City and subsequently found out

242
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.000
it was the neighborhood my dad grew up and came to the Lord and I didn't know that.

243
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.800
And but the neighborhood had changed since then.

244
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.400
So when my dad grew up in South Oklahoma City, it was

245
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.400
known as the rep was that this was the poor white

246
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.200
part of Oklahoma City.

247
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.400
And of course black folks were institutionally segregated on

248
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.500
the east side northeast side at this point and the north

249
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500
side was more affluent. And that was the Dynamics

250
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.100
of what I grew up in but a few years after he graduated from Grant as

251
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.500
many of you will remember finally in

252
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.500
Oklahoma City Federal desegregation laws

253
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.500
were enforced and busing started happening. It was a very difficult

254
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.200
time of transition, but a lot of people from the East side,

255
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.000
Where bus to the South Side in fact, some of my friends are a pastors on

256
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.100
the east side now Pastor Derek Scobee Ebenezer Baptist Church

257
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.200
told me the other day that he was bused down to Roosevelt where

258
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.200
Chauncey leads ministry right now in our neighborhood on the South

259
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.200
Side. So as that started happening, we also started having more

260
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.400
people black people moved to the South Oklahoma City and it

261
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.300
started triggering a phenomenon that happened all over

262
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.500
the United States that historians call

263
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.000
white flight.

264
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.500
People were leaving and maybe it's because

265
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.500
they were racist or maybe not so much. Maybe they're

266
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.700
just making a they're people that were already struggling financially and

267
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.700
they're making a sort of got to take care of my family calculation

268
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.200
that they're you know, supply and demand if a minority

269
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.400
Community moves into a neighborhood the majority Community doesn't

270
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.300
want to live there anymore property values are going to drop and so people started

271
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.700
moving out and and that is

272
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.500
what happened property values drop school started struggling

273
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.200
to a much higher degree and then over the course of

274
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.600
decades there started being a lot of immigration into South,

275
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.100
Oklahoma City.

276
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.200
And mostly first generation immigrants from Mexico

277
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.300
some coming from through, California on the way.

278
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.400
And that those Latino communities were rebuilding

279
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.200
really what had been a abandoned.

280
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.500
There's a lot of

281
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.300
Poverty and struggling realities in South

282
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.000
Oklahoma City, which was really a part of that Legacy of racism. But

283
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.700
the Latino Community came and was rebuilding very entrepreneurial

284
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.700
family-oriented wonderful neighbors, but also

285
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.000
at the same time there was ethnic tensions and

286
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.500
there were racial tensions as some of those folks that came through California brought some

287
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.300
game culture with him. And if you were around 20 years ago

288
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.400
in Oklahoma City, you probably remember things on the news about gang shootings. And

289
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.600
that's when we lost Crossroads mall and you know, just a lot of tragic violence

290
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.500
that was happening at that time.

291
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.100
And so by the time I came

292
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.700
was called by God back to the place where he found my dad.

293
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.200
what had been the poor white part of town had become

294
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.000
the very poor multi-ethnic part of town about 60% Latino,

295
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.500
but lots of black folks

296
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.700
lots of poor white people Vietnamese Native

297
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.300
American really diverse community and we

298
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.300
since God calling us to go into that community and preach the

299
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.300
gospel and make disciples and love our neighbors and

300
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.100
John Cena and six have our closest friends and chances

301
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.300
are living there teaching at Santa Fe South but we

302
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.500
moved into that neighborhood and and part of what we

303
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.500
knew was like there's a long history of Brokenness here and

304
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.500
we know Jesus he's the solution. He's

305
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.500
the answer, but also we need to come with a posture

306
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.000
of humility recognizing we are not the answer.

307
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.600
And we need to build a lot of relationships and learn this

308
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.600
community and we started moving into some apartment complexes

309
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.800
up and down Southwest 59th Street those communities were more majority

310
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.400
black and probably lower-income white

311
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.100
folks is the second largest group and and the Tina folks mixed in

312
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.000
with that. We started moving into those apartment complexes building relationships

313
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.400
starting Evangelistic Bible study sharing the

314
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.000
gospel people started responding to the gospel and we

315
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.100
were actually really intentional about we're not

316
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.400
going to try and start a lot of Mercy Ministries programs as if

317
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.400
we know what the solution is in this community we're going

318
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.500
to try and do is share the gospel meet neighbors listen to

319
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.400
one another and trust that as Jesus is going

320
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.000
to reconcile us and then as a reconciled community

321
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.200
living out what Galatians 3 says in Christ,

322
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.200
there's neither Jew nor Greek either slave nor free no male

323
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.300
and female, but you're all one in Christ Jesus as we live out that

324
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.100
reality God's Gonna teach us how to

325
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.500
do what Galatians 62 says which is bear one another's burdens

326
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.400
and so fulfill the law of Christ and so at

327
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:07.500
first

328
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.200
I was happening just in really organic ways as people were coming

329
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.300
to know the lord. It's like hey Grandma, Carol just got evicted who can open their home

330
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.100
for Grandma Carol to stay with her for a couple months or Joey

331
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.400
wants to go back to school at o Triple C. Let's pass

332
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.400
the hat to pay his fees that he owns them so he can get back into school

333
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.600
but over time.

334
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.500
All the things Jesus talks about and models as far as loving our neighbors

335
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.400
holistically. We just started

336
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.100
seeing over and over certain issues that would pop up again. And so we just

337
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.100
started different Ministries a Chauncey leads a great schools Ministry Outreach team

338
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.400
that's doing gospel Ministry and supporting teachers and supporting kids

339
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.300
of the 16 schools in our

340
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.000
17 Schools elementary schools in our neighborhood some like that a few

341
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.400
years ago. We saw the data that about 90% of

342
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.300
kids and correct me if I get the data wrong or y'all can

343
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.500
just assume these are estimates, but it's about

344
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.900
90% of kids in third grade. We're reading below.

345
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.300
A grade level in third grade and the problem with

346
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.600
that is there's a lot of correlations between third grade

347
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.700
reading level and going to graduate high school. And

348
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.300
then there's a lot of correlations between dropping out of high school and

349
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.200
ending up in jail. So there's this sort of

350
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.900
invisible pipeline between underfunded Intercity schools and

351
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.900
overcrowded jail systems. And

352
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.300
so that is a thing and as the

353
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.400
people of God, we've got to be Salt and Light in that area. So how do we step into

354
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.800
that through advocacy through service your church

355
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.200
you may or may not know ministries of Jesus really helped us

356
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.300
get off the ground Christ Community health Coalition Hilltop Clinic,

357
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.200
which is doing phenomenal work providing free

358
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.300
care for lots of people without insurance and providing affordable care

359
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.800
for people that are on soon to care. That's a very high quality. So addressing those

360
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.000
needs was just kind of growing organically out of

361
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.100
it. So I'm about to stop talking now, but what I would say at this point

362
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.700
is not very long ago.

363
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.500
We had been praying Lord. We need to be more effective at bilingual

364
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.900
Ministry in reaching our Latino brothers and sisters and one

365
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.300
of our partner churches that we've been working with

366
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.300
for a long period of time Rancho Village Baptist Church, which at

367
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.100
this point was a mostly Latino Spanish-speaking but bilingual Church

368
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.000
reached out to us and said hey,

369
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.600
We need leadership. We we don't have

370
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.400
a pastor right now. We love what you're doing. We maybe

371
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.100
we should start worshiping together and see if God wants to lead us to

372
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.400
unite. So Christ Community Church then merged with

373
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.300
Rancho Village Baptist Church, and now we're Redemption Church

374
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.100
and it's just beautiful to see there's probably about seven or eight

375
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.100
ethnicities most Sundays in our congregation. We're doing everything bilingual in

376
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.600
English and Spanish and it's just a powerful picture that the gospel

377
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.200
really does have the problem to bring the power to

378
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.400
bring people together. And then as we learned to love each other and listen

379
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.300
to each other in relationship God's people really have an

380
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.200
opportunity to be light. So I was supposed to tell our story and you should never tell

381
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.200
a church planter tell a story in 10 minutes because I was probably 14 or

382
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.700
something. So but I'm supposed to introduce these brothers. So Chancey Shiloh

383
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.100
brother from another mother we've been walking together for a long

384
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.100
time. He's awesome. He loves Jesus. He's a black

385
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.400
man who speaks Spanish and can seamlessly blend with

386
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.500
any ethnic group. He's like the perfect missionary guy

387
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.700
to help with what we're doing right now and Jared Stevenson

388
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.800
another great.

389
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.800
And I've got to get love to work with good friends

390
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.500
strong brother and he's like the inner city youth Whisperer

391
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.100
whose discipling a mentoring all these kids all over the South Side.

392
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.400
So welcome these guys.

393
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.600
Thank you, John Mark more honor than I deserve honestly

394
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.700
always appreciate you brother. Yeah, always well.

395
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.800
I've been

396
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.300
tasked with giving a brief bit about my

397
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.300
testimony. And so I want to share a few things. Obviously.

398
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.800
There's a lot of things that God has done in all of our Lives. Amen. There's so

399
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.800
many more if we can tell stories for ages but a

400
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.800
couple things that I think are relevant this afternoon

401
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.500
this evening are the so my

402
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.300
dad. I guess my dad. My dad came

403
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.800
to Christ in south Louisiana. And so he

404
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.700
grew up basically living his home

405
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.400
with living basically sharecroppers down in

406
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.400
south, Louisiana, and he would

407
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.300
go to school from basically from

408
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.100
October through about March or April because he was

409
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.300
the oldest brother and his family and so he had to work the field. So

410
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.100
as soon as harvest starts he's out working and yeah,

411
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.200
he still was able to graduate like third in his

412
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.900
class from from high school.

413
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.300
As the oldest brother he was supposed to stay

414
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.100
behind and work the fields. We graduated from

415
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.600
high school, but he sold a sow and three piglets to pay for

416
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.400
his first semester to Grambling State University up

417
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.900
in grammling University. I'm

418
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.300
going to Louisiana so into

419
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.200
HBC you graduated three and a half years was an accounting major

420
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.300
and then moved to Dallas my mother grew up in

421
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.200
East Texas Nacogdoches, Texas, and she was

422
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.100
in the Piney Woods out east and

423
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.700
she grew up her father was

424
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.800
Native American and white and her mother was black

425
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.000
and she grew up did

426
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.800
great in school. And then she entered into

427
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.700
Stephen F Austin State University and when

428
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.500
she entered into SFA she was in the first African-American

429
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.900
class that they let into the university that

430
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.500
the president University was fairly Progressive.

431
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.400
And so he he knew that in East Texas

432
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.600
they would be some pushback.

433
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.600
If he let blacks come into the school, so he

434
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.200
reached out to an African-American Pastor a couple

435
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.700
towns away and said hey, would you come take some classes this summer?

436
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.500
We're letting in some African-Americans next fall.

437
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.400
But if you come in this summer, I'll have an excuse that we will

438
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.300
ask me. Why are you letting African Americans know our College? I'll

439
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.000
say we've had African-Americans in our College. What are you

440
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.100
talking about? So this pastor came into classes that summer and

441
00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.400
my mom got to be in the first black class to go through and she

442
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.300
told some stories about that one of those that were

443
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.400
I think it pretty relevant is she's in a course in which

444
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.200
she was the only African-American which upon most of her course. She's an education

445
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.400
major and the professor used the inward

446
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.000
during class and everybody looked at her.

447
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.500
The professor clearly did not like my mother and didn't want her

448
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.200
and her in his class and then

449
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.200
subsequently gave her a D in the course.

450
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.200
My mother was a tenacious Fierce Jesus

451
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.500
follower. So she

452
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.200
signed up for that exact same Professor. The next

453
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.500
semester made us see in his class got her

454
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.000
bachelor's degree and then got a master's degree from that same institution and

455
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.600
then moved to Dallas to teach teach elementary

456
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.500
school my mom and dad met there in Dallas.

457
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.500
They then moved

458
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.100
to Alaska moved back to Texas back to Alaska. I had

459
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.500
my twin sister and I went back to deck to Texas into a majority white

460
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.200
neighborhood out in Lucas Texas.

461
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.100
Just east of Plano Texas. If you know Plano and I grew up

462
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.900
there going to private schools part

463
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.400
of a Southern Baptist

464
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.500
Church out in the country and that's where I gave my life

465
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.500
to Jesus. So I grew up listening to pastors

466
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.700
from I'm sure prices

467
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.200
that you know, because I know that I mean North Dallas was like the

468
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.700
Hub of evangelicalism back in the 90s the mecca.

469
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.800
Yeah, exactly exactly. I

470
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.300
Promise Keepers back and take the stadium. So we all work. So as we

471
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.600
all know so that was home.

472
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.200
And grew up got a heart to share the gospel heart to

473
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.200
love Jesus. I went to a massive Plano High School.

474
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.600
And really I got a heart there to reach high

475
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.800
school students for Jesus fast forward to Oklahoma.

476
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.100
I got on scholarship to come to University of Oklahoma

477
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.500
got here and I was sitting in a class called

478
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.200
black white relations and in America

479
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.800
taught by a professor named George Henderson, George

480
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.300
Henderson was the third black professor that OU

481
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.000
hired. In fact when he came on campus the first day to go

482
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.100
teach his first class. He walked up to the what's now the

483
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.000
price College of Business and one of the students who was going to be in his class

484
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.300
looked at him and saw his skin color and said you got

485
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.200
to get out of here man, because the professors coming and then

486
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200
he walked in and talked to class.

487
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.300
At that time Norman. We're still a sun downtown so he couldn't live inside the

488
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.400
Norman City Limits, but he helped to integrate that University. And

489
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.100
in that class. He posed a question for me

490
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.500
that changed my life. It's what Dr. Brenda Salter

491
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.000
McNeil would call a catalytic event that changed

492
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.600
my perspective on it shocked me

493
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.400
out of my normal.

494
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.800
And that was the ask the question to this this class,

495
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.700
which is majority African-American.

496
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.300
But I was with African-American with

497
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.300
an Alma Latina like a brown soul with a

498
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.600
majority white background.

499
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.300
And he said when you see a police officer, what

500
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:51.400
do you think?

501
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.200
and my response was

502
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.400
well, obviously it's now safe wherever we are is now a

503
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.900
safe place to be.

504
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.300
And the one of the guys in my group who is

505
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.200
from Houston, Texas. He said man, I'm getting out of here because it

506
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.200
just got scary if the police showed up. It just got

507
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.700
scary.

508
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.500
and I was like

509
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.400
What are you talking about?

510
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.500
You weren't an AP classes in a white Southern and

511
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.600
white Suburban High School in Texas. What are you talking about?

512
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.300
And it took me on a journey that actually

513
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.400
didn't go straight to the African-American experience because

514
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.100
subsequent to that. I got hired on at Santa Fe South Charter High

515
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.700
School teaching with Mr. Adrian Savage over here. Got to watch I got

516
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.800
to watch him. He's an excellent teacher.

517
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.100
And I was faced with the reality that a lot of my students

518
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.200
were not only my students and not only

519
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.200
Hispanic many of them were undocumented. In fact Santa Fe South used

520
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.700
to extend their Christmas break from two weeks to three weeks because

521
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.100
they knew that students are coming back from Mexico and they wouldn't make it across the

522
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:53.500
first time.

523
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.600
And I when I was in AP economics in

524
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.300
high school, I took a test on where I fell in the political spectrum and

525
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.000
I was the I was the only black kid in the class and I was the furthest on the right.

526
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.800
And so all of my politics aligned with the

527
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.400
Republican Party.

528
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.300
But my students.

529
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.200
Had issues and I loved my students.

530
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.200
They invited me to their quinceañeras. They give me carne asada. They fed me

531
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.400
enchiladas Verdes like these were my kids. These are my family. And so

532
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.200
when one of my kids is that

533
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.100
cross country practicing is a phone call from his mom saying I'm not going to

534
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.400
see you again guys got deported.

535
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.200
Or when I'm talking to to my

536
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.800
senior in high school I've had for for four

537
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.500
years and he says or for two years and I say hey, what

538
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.200
are you gonna do next year is that I don't know probably gonna go work on concrete. It's

539
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.600
like we just like we're not gonna go to college like shall I

540
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.200
want to go to college? It's not gonna give me papers not gonna

541
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.600
be able to get a job.

542
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.600
So I'm gonna do that.

543
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.800
And I watched Hope being taken away from kids.

544
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.100
Because of their background experience that they didn't

545
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.500
have any control over and it shook me.

546
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.100
to say

547
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.900
I've got to be involved in in this because my kids really

548
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.300
matter.

549
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.400
And then after helping plant Christ Community Church actually meeting John Mark.

550
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.200
He began to show me that not all black people

551
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.600
were like me.

552
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.200
And that my heroes weren't the only black people who

553
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.800
are alive.

554
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.600
And it took me on a journey of this whole idea of racial reconciliation.

555
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.400
That is given me I'm still learning about what

556
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.600
empathy really means.

557
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.400
that empathy isn't just

558
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.300
Agreeing that you could have that perspective but trying to actually see

559
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.500
what it might feel like to be in this person's shoes.

560
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.200
And then to walk out what Jesus says about

561
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.800
loving my neighbor.

562
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.200
That's a little bit of my story. I took I took pastures. Thank

563
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.700
you. It's Jared.

564
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.500
I know he's already been introduced. But this is my brother from another mother

565
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.200
so all of us and we used to

566
00:28:59.200 --> 00:28:59.500
live together.

567
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.900
Yeah, so my journey is a

568
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.200
little bit different than chances and

569
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.000
that is wonderful. And I love me and

570
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.700
walking alongside him and John Mark

571
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.300
and you know my I have a

572
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.700
beautiful wife. She's not here today and she's

573
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.000
white.

574
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.300
I have two little kids

575
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.900
one three years old the three

576
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.300
year boy named rashan, and then I got a six year

577
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.000
old girl named Ayana.

578
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.200
They were half white half black.

579
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.400
I grew up in Broken Arrow,

580
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.300
Oklahoma and Broken Arrow,

581
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.000
Oklahoma is majority White.

582
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.200
My parents both of them didn't have

583
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.200
a father in their life.

584
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.900
my story starts

585
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.000
with

586
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.600
some pain sometimes

587
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.500
my grandmother was a

588
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.200
Beautiful woman a strong black woman like

589
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.600
your mother it's a that's

590
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.200
a really beautiful story man. I you know some of those things you shared

591
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.800
I didn't even know that bro the okay. Yeah,

592
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.200
man, that's what a beauty about

593
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.200
like coming and hanging out and doing things with your friends.

594
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.200
You learn stuff. It's awesome anyway, but I my

595
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.800
grandmother was a strong black woman and she

596
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.200
during the time

597
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.900
in which you were in classroom

598
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.000
with Dr. Martin Luther King died. She was

599
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.700
awesome in a classroom crying.

600
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.200
And she grew

601
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.200
up and she always had a motto which

602
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.000
is like wherever there's white people there. I am also

603
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.400
she passed that on to my my mother

604
00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.100
my grandma used to walk down the streets.

605
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.200
She used to work for the county clerk office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

606
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.500
She'd walk down streets and she'd pick up change off the

607
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.300
ground because she was so poor. She can she couldn't pay for

608
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.400
the parking downtown, but she knew that she needed to

609
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.400
provide for her family.

610
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.100
As she grew up.

611
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.400
She kept on leading us all to Jesus.

612
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.400
She took us to a church of Christ called North Peoria Church

613
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.000
of Christ on the north side of Tulsa. And

614
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.300
that's where I grew up. That's where I was introduced

615
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.700
to Jesus at 10 years old. I was baptized in

616
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.600
the name of Father Son and the Holy Spirit and came

617
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.000
no Christ. But as

618
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.700
you know, sometimes the way

619
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.100
that we grow is not always in a straight line.

620
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.300
Sometimes it's not

621
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.800
in a straight line is sometimes it's here and

622
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.000
there and up and down and in when

623
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.700
it comes to Breaking generational chains.

624
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.700
It is not so not straight line all the

625
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.800
time. It can be in Jesus. But sometimes

626
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.500
it's not like that and for my family that was

627
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.100
not the case see when I became a teenager.

628
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.300
life started getting hard

629
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.800
The my family is a relationships are coming apart.

630
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.700
They were breaking apart. There was some

631
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.200
things that happened that made it to where we didn't know if

632
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.900
we were going to stay together as a family.

633
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.100
The same things of the past

634
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.100
that were handed down were happening to

635
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.600
our family again.

636
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.300
and and God somehow

637
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.500
made a way for us and he kept

638
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.900
us and there's forgiveness and Reconciliation

639
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.900
in the household and it was really beautiful. And

640
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.700
so I got to stay with my parents and they

641
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.400
kept working it out and I grew up

642
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.400
with my parents and then

643
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.000
I will so somehow got good at basketball. I don't know

644
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.000
maybe being six four years also kind of helpful, too and

645
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.500
And so I started playing basketball and and got

646
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.500
really good and got a scholarship.

647
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.300
And my mom used to keep saying this thing to me over and over

648
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.800
again. Hey, wherever there's white people there you are also and

649
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.600
I couldn't quite understand what she

650
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.600
was meaning by this but she was really dogging about that. See

651
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.200
she had left the north side of Tulsa for

652
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.000
the specific reason that John Market brought up earlier. The schools

653
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.500
were very good where she

654
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:32.800
was from

655
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.600
she wanted her son to be educated in the best schools

656
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.600
that she could possibly get her kids into and so

657
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.600
she did and she would do anything possible to

658
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600
do that. So she went and got a hood home.

659
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.200
And and started renovating that

660
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.300
working night and day, you know with with her with

661
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.500
my father and they worked so hard to do

662
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.500
that and I I

663
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.100
ended up from there kind of

664
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.500
being able to receive some of that blessing. They pushed

665
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.900
me through I got to college and there they

666
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.500
were like man, there's my son he made it. He's in

667
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.000
college. He's about to get his degree and then my

668
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.600
life changed.

669
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.700
I ended up meeting Jesus my senior

670
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.400
year of college and he changed my life

671
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.200
drastically. He's and then

672
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.800
he sent me on a journey that led me to South OKC living

673
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.800
in a low-income apartment complex and

674
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.400
everything that I worked really hard

675
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.300
for to get upward Mobility is now squashed.

676
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.300
I'm now in the southwest side, Oklahoma City.

677
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.100
And God is calling me

678
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.800
to go a different way, but also a

679
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.000
way that leads to life.

680
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.500
and that you know,

681
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.700
that's that's been my story every every

682
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.300
step of the way and it's really beautiful to see this

683
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.200
and to think about this in this way, which is this

684
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.300
I've had a lot of opportunities to be angry.

685
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.300
My what my mom went through

686
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.600
sometimes my dad went through sometimes. Yeah fired from

687
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.300
a job that he did nothing wrong one time and

688
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.200
it was really frustrating for him.

689
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.300
And then they were the boss found out that he got fired and reinstated

690
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.700
him as a whole long thing and it was about racism.

691
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.400
My brother in high school,

692
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.800
he's a freshman and I was

693
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.000
I was a senior and I was you know,

694
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.600
kind of a big guy and had a big friend and I heard some

695
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.900
some noise about somebody calling my my brother and

696
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.500
inward.

697
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.300
And I get upset.

698
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.300
But every step of the way when my mom was doing and when my

699
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.400
grandma was doing was planning seeds that that is not the

700
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.100
way to live.

701
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.800
That is not the way to life.

702
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.500
And so when we heard some some

703
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.300
quotes of James 1:19.

704
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.500
Be slow to anger.

705
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.900
That's a learned skill. That's just

706
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.500
learned skill.

707
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.500
And you know, the the next verse is

708
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.800
really important to James 1:20 says the

709
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.700
anger of man does not produce the

710
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.800
righteousness of God.

711
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.200
my friends

712
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.500
the race conversation needs us to be

713
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.200
people who are humble and who are

714
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.300
slow to anger and also who do not choose the

715
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.300
way of anger and I guarantee because what

716
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.800
the scripture says is true is true that

717
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.200
it will produce the righteousness the opposite effect

718
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.100
of what anger will not do it will produce the righteousness

719
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.800
of God.

720
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.700
And so I am just a big advocate of

721
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.800
that and I've been so so blessed every single step of

722
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.700
the way to even when I do get angry to

723
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.300
have people like Johnson that people like John Mark

724
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.700
Listen to Me Slowly encourage me

725
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.500
and then say Hey, listen, this is

726
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.100
that's not the way and I've had that my whole

727
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.100
life and ultimately I know that it's been Jesus in my

728
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.900
life doing that every step of the way. And so that's been my story but

729
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.700
Well, you are you're encouraging us tonight, and I am very

730
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.400
excited because if you didn't notice, there's only

731
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.100
one young lady on our panel and we finally get to

732
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.900
hear from Tasha and so Tasia and sorry I've

733
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.000
been calling I've been

734
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.600
calling. I've been calling canadra lots of

735
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.700
different names, but I finally got that one down, but taste

736
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.700
it. We're very excited to hear from YouTube.

737
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.300
do just

738
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.400
that get real short and sweet.

739
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.700
I'm messing

740
00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.500
around but I want to focus in sharing

741
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:02.300
my testimony with what reconciliation unaware

742
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.400
looks like when it

743
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.700
goes to stepping into other communities.

744
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.600
I was born and raised on the east side of Oklahoma City

745
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.900
and for fun.

746
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.500
We would go to canadrice side

747
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.900
of town the west side of town and we would get on the bus and

748
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.500
it was called super Saturdays. There was

749
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.300
a church that would come pick us up at the corner, but

750
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.500
they would hit different Corners

751
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.400
in this particular community and they would transport us

752
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.600
to the south side of Oklahoma and all we

753
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.000
did according to me at that time was played

754
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.200
in a lot of candy and

755
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.500
took lots of candy home with us which for

756
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.400
us was a treat and

757
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.300
I didn't realize that that time that

758
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.300
it was seeds being planted.

759
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.000
of racial boundaries not existing because

760
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.400
it was taking time to

761
00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.300
get to know people that care for

762
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.200
us that don't look like us when I was

763
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.200
raised in a community of just from the

764
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.600
East side only people that look like us so naturally

765
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.600
having that experience not at a

766
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.300
not as a child really having the Insight of what

767
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:20.100
this is doing for me, but as I grew up subconsciously

768
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.700
understanding that, you know,

769
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.400
not that there's not race or not

770
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.000
that there's

771
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.300
a lack of like, you know,

772
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.400
people say we don't see some people say we don't see color but

773
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.800
there are differences that are

774
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.200
apparent I I grew up in settings

775
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.500
that

776
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.600
As I travel through life and hearing some

777
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.700
of the experiences that they've had I had experiences but

778
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.300
I didn't have those experiences until I was an

779
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.000
adult because my parents were a

780
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.900
dad to assisted Pastor

781
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.500
my mom. They always kept us in church, but they

782
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.200
born in the 50s. They knew what

783
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.600
was out there that they didn't want us to experience. So we

784
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.300
were in assists sheltered but I

785
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.800
didn't have those experiences directly. My

786
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.200
experience was like I

787
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.400
was the child to say that you're racist that like

788
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.100
no and he's like you'll see when you

789
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.400
get older or you're you're naive. You don't know what

790
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.200
you're talking about. And I and I would we would have those

791
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.000
conversations because it's normalized for

792
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.800
us to talk about experiences and

793
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.600
how it affects us whatever the impact

794
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.200
was. So I wanted to share what it

795
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:41.700
looks like.

796
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.100
To have those experiences but

797
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.300
have the love of Christ that is taught

798
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.400
in our home. Yes. We have pain that can

799
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.200
put us at risk of having Prejudice. But we

800
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.100
also have the hope of impacted community

801
00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.700
that trans that transcends a

802
00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.500
lot of those things and inadvertently plant

803
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.400
seeds.

804
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.700
That we that grow as we get older and

805
00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.400
not being aware. So that was just like a brief

806
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.700
part of how those little

807
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.700
trips to Super Saturdays and Candy led to

808
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.500
not

809
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.800
emphasizing so much

810
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.300
of our experiences or my

811
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.200
parents experiences to the point where I say. No, I don't want

812
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.300
it. They stay over there. We stay over

813
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.300
here because we're good over here and we'll figure it out, you know,

814
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.800
because reconciliation doesn't look

815
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.300
like that. It's it takes us

816
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.800
back to segregation and separating and

817
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.500
causes us to be offended and that is

818
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.300
just the opposite of what the word

819
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.800
of God teaches us. And so I just wanted to share that.

820
00:41:59.300 --> 00:41:59.700
Thank you, Jason.

821
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.500
We should have more women on this group, but getting

822
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.500
amend in the well, so

823
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.700
I'm gonna and if you could load this first question, the

824
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.300
first question is kind of a softball. What do

825
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.300
we members of Henderson Hills Baptist Church

826
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.500
Disciples of Jesus Christ. What do we need to know?

827
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.800
About having an open and honest dialogue about race and discrimination.

828
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.600
Let me

829
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.300
I'll start us off. So I'm looking

830
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.800
for my I'm a written process. I wrote some things out. So.

831
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.100
The question what do we need to know about having an open honest dialogue about

832
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.000
race and Reconciliation? There's

833
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.100
there's really and I'll try to make

834
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.200
this brief. There's three things. I'm thinking about one of them is that any kind

835
00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.000
of dialogue is going to move with the speed of relationship?

836
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.500
It's hard to move the speed of relationship.

837
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.800
And it's not going to move faster than that.

838
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.300
And which means to the second thing which means probably gonna get kind of uncomfortable.

839
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.800
Which I didn't talk about race ethnicity even

840
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.600
saying race.

841
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.200
There's debate about what that even means.

842
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.100
And and some of that is is based

843
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.200
on how much melanin you have in your skin. Would

844
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:25.700
you think about race?

845
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.100
And so I think being able to even dialogue and get the

846
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.100
same even get the same vocabulary about what we're even talking about.

847
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.600
We'll take relationship.

848
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.000
Think that's the first thing and the second thing is it will take it's movies

849
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.300
to relationship which may not be a fast enough for

850
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.300
so we'll get uncomfortable and and there's

851
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.100
a phrase my mom used to say all the

852
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.200
time was people don't know how much you care how much you know until they

853
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.500
know how much you care. I'm sure you've heard that before.

854
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.300
And I think a lot of us because of our human nature.

855
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.600
We walk into situations thinking that

856
00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.900
our perspective is the normal.

857
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:01.900
perspective

858
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.000
and

859
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.100
and it's not

860
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.100
It may not be it may be in the part of the country that we're in.

861
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.300
It may be in our family, but it may not be the perspective that

862
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.500
that is normal for someone else and I

863
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.300
think the reason relationship is really important is

864
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.200
I've got to be able to love somebody enough.

865
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.700
That when my feelings get hurt and my perspective

866
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.900
gets interrupted. I don't leave the relationship because

867
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:29.500
I love them.

868
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.400
And so I think those things I think are really

869
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:33.500
important.

870
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.800
So Chancellor you would say that.

871
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:40.900
our relationship

872
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.600
correlates with our offendability and if we're easily offended

873
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.700
in a relationships over and so the Futures is

874
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.400
not good. Yeah, I think that's right. And I think there's there's

875
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.700
something else I would say that goes on with that. We just said Phil is that is that

876
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.900
When you enter into this into this space.

877
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.400
A lot of marginalized people don't want

878
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.100
to have open honest conversation with people from the majority of

879
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:05.300
culture.

880
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.900
Because they've been hurt too much. Yeah.

881
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.100
Or their parents were or their grandparents were or their aunt

882
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.300
and uncle were and they've got stories that validate that and

883
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.500
so until people know that you actually really

884
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.200
do care from both sides. I mean,

885
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.500
I think on the on the other side,

886
00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.800
I think a number of white people walk around with

887
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.900
a lot of guilt afraid of an angry

888
00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.500
black person coming at them if they express

889
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.200
what they really think.

890
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.700
And the only way to change that is relationship.

891
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.200
to believe someone to trust someone enough

892
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.500
to get down into the room.

893
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.800
Because you get anything to add about that.

894
00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.600
All right here.

895
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.300
I think just picking back off of what

896
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.500
you said about, you know things being uncomfortable.

897
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.400
It's going to be uncomfortable and it's not uncomfortable on one

898
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.500
side. Like you mentioned. It's on both sides, but when we're

899
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.800
working through emotions, we have to come and

900
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.200
try to connect we have to come from a place of

901
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.300
curiosity. So it's almost like when we're talking to her

902
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.600
child and our child is telling us something or they're feeling

903
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.900
a lot of emotion and they're really passionate. We

904
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.800
we Overlook the passion or

905
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.300
what they might be presenting to us.

906
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.600
And we ask questions of curiosity. Like where is

907
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.600
this coming from what happened to build

908
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.700
empathy and to you know, bring about

909
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.500
you know relationship. So one of

910
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.200
the things that I think is important is to come from a place of

911
00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.400
curiosity and understanding or wanting to understand someone else's

912
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.200
experience so that

913
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.000
they're more comfortable to even open up and say more

914
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.000
Um, and this is really hard to say,

915
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.600
but I think it's important to not

916
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.400
take it personal because sometimes

917
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.100
when we talk about these things, it's it

918
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:09.400
may feel like oh like you're saying

919
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.000
I did it. I didn't do it like any and you

920
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.200
get into a place where you defending or there's a fence there.

921
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.500
So not taking it personal

922
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.400
but kind of opening your eyes to

923
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.500
Being able to talk to yourself and say I I didn't

924
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.800
do this, but I'd like to know how I can help to change

925
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.500
The Narrative of what is

926
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.800
out there now so and being

927
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.600
and being reflective like how can you contribute

928
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.600
to changing the narrative and

929
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.700
being able to have the conversations just not in within

930
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.500
your community, but how can you step outside of that

931
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.300
community? So that's a little bit of what

932
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.500
I feel like is you know, so the

933
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.500
if you could shape the narrative differently.

934
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.500
And you knew that you weren't going to be offending.

935
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.500
A new white friend if you could never how

936
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.500
would you shape that differently?

937
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.800
Like I know I know that.

938
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.000
We as flawed human beings we'll talk differently in

939
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.600
certain circles than we will in other circles. How can

940
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.200
we how can we do better? How can we talk honestly in

941
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.300
circular? I want to give John Market an opportunity

942
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.500
because he's a he's lived this out.

943
00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.800
I'll talk white people to white people.

944
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.800
Here's an observation as as people were sharing stories.

945
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.100
Did you hear how many moms and dads and grandparents came up?

946
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.000
And what we're dealing with is generational trauma

947
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.000
rooted in sin generational sin.

948
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.600
And the Bible has so

949
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.500
much to teach about that.

950
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.600
And what we find is that God's love

951
00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.000
is steadfast and he brings healing

952
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.400
generationally, we could talk about a lot of examples. Okay,

953
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.600
let's talk about the Patriarchs in Genesis real quick.

954
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.600
Abraham and Sarah and

955
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.100
Hagar have some issues there's some polygamy

956
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.300
issues some favorite wife favorite cut child issues that

957
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.100
gets passed on to Sibling Rivalry that

958
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.300
becomes fratricidal Strife meaning these people might kill each

959
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.000
other Isaac and Ishmael and it escalates next Generation.

960
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.900
We get Jacob and Esau there's favoritism

961
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.100
and there's rivalry and it escalates the

962
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.400
Next Generation. Jacob's got some favorites and they literally sell

963
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.400
them into slavery because they decided to be merciful instead of

964
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.600
killing him. So the sin is getting passed on and the trauma

965
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.600
is getting passed on generationally, but also each one

966
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.100
is slowly learning each generation is learning how to walk

967
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:48.400
with God.

968
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.800
And by the time you get to the fourth generation of that family of Patriarchs you

969
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.700
get in Joseph one of the most Godly righteous

970
00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.600
humans in the Bible who out of

971
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.600
radical humility and restorative justice

972
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.100
and Grace says what you intended for

973
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.500
evil God intended for good. I'm gonna forgive and because of his Mercy healing

974
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.100
is possible, but it was a generational trauma that

975
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.500
took generations and that means we really need to take seriously.

976
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.500
Generations to heal and that means we need to take seriously First Corinthians 13:4.

977
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.700
Love is patient.

978
00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.200
And the question is as white people.

979
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.900
I think one of the things we struggle with is we don't want to deal with our own necessarily

980
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.300
complicity in all of that. I mean,

981
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.500
I started my story one generation back, but I'll tell you.

982
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.900
for most of my early life

983
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.100
Growing up as a poor white kid in an inner

984
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.100
city community in Texas.

985
00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.400
I took pride in there may

986
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.100
be a lot of ways in which I'm shamed in this culture, but at least we're not

987
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:46.600
racist.

988
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.600
And my parents worked hard for everything that they had.

989
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.400
And it wasn't until I was I don't know maybe 30 and

990
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.100
my grandfather was 90 that I heard him. Tell the story of how our people came to,

991
00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:56.400
Oklahoma.

992
00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.300
Because they were small-scale farmers in Arkansas who had a few

993
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:00.600
slaves.

994
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.800
And when they lost those slaves after the Civil War, they couldn't

995
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.200
keep the farm up. They lost the farm and became destitute and came

996
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.600
to Oklahoma for a greater opportunity and that kind of messed up my family narrative.

997
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:15.400
And so the thing is, okay. Maybe it's not my fault,

998
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.600
but it is my responsibility.

999
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.400
Looking towards the future and as we're dealing

1000
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.300
with those generation issues. There's there's predictable things that can happen.

1001
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:24.700
I mean

1002
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.100
Here's one of the things as we're talking about our trauma offense. That's

1003
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.400
one of the predictable things if we're talking about in the body of Christ the historian

1004
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.300
Mark Knoll wrote a great book called God and race in

1005
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.300
American history. And one of the things he observes is that if you look at Baptists in

1006
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.800
America, you can look at historically black Baptist nominations historically

1007
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.400
white Baptist denominations, and we have the same doctrinal statements.

1008
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.400
with theologically agree

1009
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.400
But we've disagreed about race historically and that has played its

1010
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.000
way out politically how we think about what moral issues should

1011
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.600
be talked about in the public sphere and what

1012
00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.200
moral issues we have a responsibility to talk

1013
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.500
about and it's affected party alignments.

1014
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.300
Such that and one of those denominations if you

1015
00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.500
self identify as a republican, you won't get kicked out if your

1016
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.100
past review that but you might get marginalized and the other denomination if

1017
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.100
you self-identify as a Democrat, you won't get kicked out,

1018
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.700
but you might get marginalized. I'll let you figure out which one is which on how that goes.

1019
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:19.900
and

1020
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.200
Sometimes what starts happening is?

1021
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.700
if we start trying to move, okay, Jesus said

1022
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.200
or the Bible says we're all one Christ is our peace.

1023
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.100
He tore down the wall of hostility and we're quoting all the Bible. So let's come together.

1024
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.700
We start worshiping together and praying together and talking about unity and

1025
00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.400
Reconciliation and then somebody starts talking about

1026
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.800
a justice issue. That seems non negotiable to them.

1027
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.300
and they quote some Bible verses on it from Isaiah 58 and

1028
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.900
Amos 5 and James one and

1029
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.500
and they're being biblical.

1030
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.100
But to somebody else it sounds like you just

1031
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.800
got political.

1032
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.000
And here's the thing that is going to happen.

1033
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.000
That is going to happen and what often happens then is.

1034
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.300
So now I thought I could trust this person as a real Christian, but actually

1035
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.500
they're political and they probably thought the same thing.

1036
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.400
Until that conversation is just a different different alignment. And

1037
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.000
that's the moment where I'm not up here to like sort out how we should

1038
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.200
deal with all those policy issues. But that's the moment where we have

1039
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.700
to decide is our common relationship with

1040
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.500
Jesus enough for us to keep trusting. This

1041
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.100
is a brother in the Lord and keep thinking I have something to

1042
00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.300
learn from them and their experience even if we may not

1043
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.900
sort out that political difference this generation.

1044
00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.700
Mmm, thanks. I think that's some of the patients death.

1045
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.100
Thanks for jumping in so I didn't keep talking. No. I told

1046
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:41.700
him I would and every day usually my

1047
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.400
wife. I want to go back to something you said.

1048
00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.600
It's not my fault, but it is my responsibility.

1049
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:49.400
that

1050
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.800
if we could how could we live that out Jared you and

1051
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.400
I Tulsa and Tulsa had

1052
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.000
a really ugly race for at the 20s and it's been

1053
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.400
playing out now for way too long. But what does

1054
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:05.600
it look like?

1055
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:09.900
for white communities

1056
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:14.100
to realize that it's not their fault, but

1057
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.400
it is their responsibility what I love your story about candy

1058
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.400
and super Saturdays and it's

1059
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.700
so simple, but it was profound. And so

1060
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.400
Jerry, what do you think? What could why

1061
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.000
people to do is take responsibility to build relationships.

1062
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:31.700
Yeah.

1063
00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.500
There's a verse of Philippians. It says let us not

1064
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.800
look to our own interests, but also to the interests of

1065
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.100
others.

1066
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.300
And I really feel like a lot of our

1067
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.200
issues deal and stem from a problem

1068
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.600
that is really deep.

1069
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.100
very historic

1070
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.700
goes back to the very beginning. It's Pride.

1071
00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.700
That's right. It's pride and the the

1072
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.500
self-preservation tactics are

1073
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.300
innumerable.

1074
00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.300
They just incredibly normal and

1075
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.300
I would.

1076
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.400
I would even go as far to say that a lot

1077
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.200
of the issues are just the fact that we don't want

1078
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.500
to be confronted in our error.

1079
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.500
We oftentimes like to live as

1080
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.000
if

1081
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.100
life is just okay.

1082
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.100
As it is, especially when it's going well.

1083
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.100
But the problem is is

1084
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:39.500
that the needs of my neighbor are actually my responsibility.

1085
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.800
and when I look to the other

1086
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.700
side of the town

1087
00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.300
and somebody else's kid is struggling. Do I

1088
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:50.000
say man?

1089
00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.300
Those parents they need to get their acts together.

1090
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.200
They need to figure it out.

1091
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.300
They should be working three and four and five jobs like

1092
00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.400
my parents did.

1093
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.200
Or do we go man?

1094
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.000
That kid is struggling. How can I

1095
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.400
get in a fight and help?

1096
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.900
And I think that's part

1097
00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.700
of our issue is kind of

1098
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.100
a flipping of the script getting out of

1099
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:23.300
self-preservation mode getting out of self-protecting mode and

1100
00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.000
thinking of people as people to love as

1101
00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.300
true neighbors and those

1102
00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.500
they're interests or even greater than my own. That's a

1103
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.300
high calling y'all.

1104
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.200
Can you imagine that somebody saying that to you could do matching the

1105
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.000
Apostle Paul walking up to you and saying Hey, listen that person's

1106
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.400
interest over there next to you. It's more

1107
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.200
important than your own interest.

1108
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.400
Give up yours and seek theirs.

1109
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.500
It is it it's an incredible thing,

1110
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.300
but if we can get to that place, I think

1111
00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.600
we could really solve a lot of those issues.

1112
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.400
Also, once we get in those conversations, we're

1113
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.500
not trying to win an argument.

1114
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.200
We're not trying to win a battle.

1115
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.500
We don't wage war against flesh and blood.

1116
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.700
We we wage war against powers and

1117
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:20.300
principalities guys. This has been generational and

1118
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.100
who do we think

1119
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.500
was behind all of it?

1120
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.800
And the grander scheme of things it was the

1121
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.300
powers and principalities the rulers of this air

1122
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.500
and this age, but Jesus Christ is

1123
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.300
actively working against it.

1124
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.900
And to bring victory in the name of Jesus and will

1125
00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.800
we be on the side of Truth and walk alongside

1126
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.200
Jesus as he's reconciling the world

1127
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.900
is a real question, but it's gonna look like dying the self.

1128
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.600
That's been my answer. Amen. Yeah. Amen.

1129
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.400
So Chauncey what did John Mark Hart

1130
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.100
do to win your relationship?

1131
00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:05.600
That's a really good question. Yeah. Well, let

1132
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.800
me tell you that's real

1133
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.100
there were

1134
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:12.200
I think there were a number of things.

1135
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.500
the first time so

1136
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:19.700
jump workroom is better than I do the first time we met I

1137
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.400
remember more the second time we met.

1138
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:22.500
and

1139
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.400
it was in a Bible as literature class at the University of Oklahoma.

1140
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.700
And I don't remember everything about that class public. I

1141
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.500
didn't do much to the homework in a Bible study

1142
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:33.600
class.

1143
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.500
It fast enough praise the Lord, but I

1144
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.600
do remember the professor saying something.

1145
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.200
about

1146
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:48.200
about whether or not the New Testament was all got

1147
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.400
inspired something like this and John

1148
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:55.500
Mark called him on it very in a very like masterful educated scholarly

1149
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:57.700
way and the professor recanted

1150
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.600
what he said like in class. It was like this dude knows

1151
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.600
description third time.

1152
00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.400
We got time together. We were sitting over Phoenix Oklahoma

1153
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.900
campus it was over in Kate Center.

1154
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.800
And I think democ might have been trying to recruit me to help in that nonprofit. He

1155
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.400
was working with he didn't say that outright, but

1156
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.800
I think they might want to happening, but he did give me some advice.

1157
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.600
and he said this he said never

1158
00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.400
settle for a nominal Ministry

1159
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.800
never settle for a nominal Ministry

1160
00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:34.300
Ministry that's in name only we're saying we're

1161
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:34.900
doing a lot of stuff.

1162
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.100
But we're not actually doing what we're saying. We're doing don't ever settle for that.

1163
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.100
That was that was number three.

1164
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.700
the fourth time we talked

1165
00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.100
Was when we talked about maybe planting the church together.

1166
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.600
and at that time I was I've been

1167
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.700
teaching on the south side for

1168
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:58.000
five years four and a half years.

1169
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.300
And if you've never taught you don't know what it's like if you

1170
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.900
have to you know what it's like and I was pretty burned out.

1171
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.100
And I had gone back to a father figure of mine in Norman and he was

1172
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.200
I was finding some healing there.

1173
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.300
And John Mark asked me to jump on this on this ship.

1174
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.300
To go go go do Mission and I was thinking I am

1175
01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.500
burned out a mission man.

1176
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.400
But I thought was praying the Lord said you go and

1177
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.700
I'm gonna heal you as you go mmm.

1178
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:33.100
And that first summer the

1179
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.400
second summer of the church the church

1180
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:34.600
plant.

1181
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.700
We hosted a bunch of guys to come and move

1182
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.400
into the south side and live in

1183
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.300
our homes and go out and do ministry and before that Summer

1184
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.100
started. I'm working out to me and he said hey.

1185
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.200
We're gonna be doing a lot of ministry this summer. We got to press out

1186
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.900
people at home. Then the apartments we got

1187
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.700
to get in the neighborhoods.

1188
01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.000
He said but I know.

1189
01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.700
That you work your tail off all year long.

1190
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.200
So I really think this summer should be a time of rest

1191
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:04.700
for you.

1192
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.200
If you want to come out to the code block parties feel free, but you should

1193
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.500
really rest because you're a teacher.

1194
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.200
What I'm saying, is that John Mark saw me.

1195
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:16.500
and

1196
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.100
without

1197
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.700
my initiative he just cared for my soul.

1198
01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.100
And as like what a 31 year old he shepherded my heart

1199
01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.200
28 year olds with that. He separated my heart.

1200
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.100
And so I think both God told me to follow him. That was

1201
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:32.300
helpful.

1202
01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.800
But also he earned that.

1203
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.100
by just

1204
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:37.900
by just loving me.

1205
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:39.900
and so I think

1206
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.500
I think then when it came to other issues I trusted

1207
01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:44.600
him.

1208
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.000
You know.

1209
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.200
I care for him. Yeah, I

1210
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.500
gotta

1211
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.200
tell you I gotta tell you about the first one. This is really short film the first

1212
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.600
one he doesn't remember it. It was a college Ministry party. There

1213
01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.400
was a dance party Chauncey was the best dancer there

1214
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.700
and the coolest guy there and I thought this guy is awesome. And

1215
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.300
that's the whole story.

1216
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.100
Amity believes that John Mark was the better dancer.

1217
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:14.900
so

1218
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.000
this is the last question because I want us to

1219
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.100
spend some time together praying.

1220
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.100
but

1221
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.900
we love to look at Revelation 7 because

1222
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.400
it's a picture of the church together every

1223
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.800
nation every tribe every tongue and it

1224
01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.300
says a great multitude that no one can number from every

1225
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.600
nation from all tribes and all peoples and all languages will

1226
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.900
be standing Before the Throne and before the lamb.

1227
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.700
in perfect Unity

1228
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.300
But until that great day.

1229
01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.600
Try to get this down to one or two sentences. I'm gonna let Asia go

1230
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.400
first because she she took the shortest while

1231
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:52.700
ago but

1232
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.300
She can have a paragraph but until that

1233
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.600
great day, how can we Henderson Hills Baptist Church?

1234
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.700
promote diversity and inclusion in

1235
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.100
our church

1236
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.100
I'm prepared for this one, but

1237
01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.100
I think off the top of my head I remember.

1238
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.900
The challenges that I had in the

1239
01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.200
workplace and I feel

1240
01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.600
like Henderson Hills can promote diversity

1241
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.200
and inclusion by recognizing the

1242
01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.100
gifts and people a crate

1243
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.900
across racial boundaries and putting them

1244
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.000
in positions of leadership and serve

1245
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.700
it to to open up the access and

1246
01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.500
communities that you know, you wouldn't normally

1247
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.600
serve in so I think that's a start

1248
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.400
is, you know to put people in positions to see

1249
01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.300
what they do well and to Usher them

1250
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.600
in and give them opportunities.

1251
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:06.800
Okay.

1252
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.500
he had to Revelation 7 is so

1253
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.400
beautiful and

1254
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.100
When I I think about it.

1255
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.700
One thing I think of is this.

1256
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.500
the word hospitality

1257
01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.000
Dr. Clarence Hill, it's a pastor hanging out.

1258
01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:36.000
In Norman does

1259
01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:37.200
a lot of stuff with the stronger get

1260
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.300
together movement has a book called race

1261
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:40.700
to Jesus.

1262
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.200
And in it he has a chapter.

1263
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.600
On on this topic and on hospitality.

1264
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.400
And what I really think is really beautiful about is

1265
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.000
this he calls us to Luke 14 faith.

1266
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.300
and he calls us to Matthew 13 seed like

1267
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.600
Faith you were talking about seeds earlier

1268
01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.600
and that seat is an important because

1269
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.800
What small acts of?

1270
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.300
Kindness and faith, can

1271
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.200
we do and what greater thing? Can we do

1272
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.000
than to open up our home to people intentionally?

1273
01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:26.200
I think hospitality is

1274
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.700
the way like one

1275
01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.400
of the ways you think about Revelation 7

1276
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.300
and some of the stuff that's around you what we could

1277
01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:38.100
maybe just start doing that right now, you know, John 17

1278
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.200
talks about eternal life

1279
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.100
and we know what eternal life and to see

1280
01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.500
it's now it's not later. It's it's now because

1281
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:51.100
we know Jesus and the

1282
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.200
what's beautiful about when we

1283
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.000
open our homes.

1284
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.200
When we open our homes to one another I just share with

1285
01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.200
you really quick. And then I'm a pass it to my friend this week. I

1286
01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.900
was at something called Community groups that

1287
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:07.300
we we have and I kind

1288
01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.400
of opened it up after being in Luke

1289
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.500
chapter 6 because that's what passes we were in a

1290
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.300
week for our sermon.

1291
01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.400
And my my father-in-law start sharing

1292
01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.400
about his his journey and how

1293
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.500
he had read. Let Justice roll down the two

1294
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.300
brought up Joe and and as he

1295
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.600
was sharing about let Justice roll down we kind

1296
01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.100
of went back around a circle and then he kind of

1297
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.400
came back to and he said have you guys read that book before?

1298
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.300
And many of the people in the group had not

1299
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.200
and I had forgotten I had given them

1300
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.000
the book in the first place. I was like, yeah, bro I have and he he was

1301
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.200
like, he's like, yeah, I know you have you gave me the

1302
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.600
book? Okay. Yeah upside. I

1303
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.100
forgot about that. But all of

1304
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:58.200
a sudden he starts talking about the fact that in the book John Perkins

1305
01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.900
had been beaten really badly.

1306
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.000
Being so badly that he was left in the pool of

1307
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:03.200
blood.

1308
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.900
And he starts breaking down crying.

1309
01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.200
This breaking down crying and the rest of the group

1310
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.200
just kind of stands there and it's like one of those really beautiful

1311
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.500
moments as an older white man is

1312
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:21.200
sharing about that and sharing about the Brokenness of pain of someone

1313
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.200
else that he didn't know but he read the story and it broke him,

1314
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:24.700
you know.

1315
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.500
And here's some other people in the room next

1316
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.300
to me and there's another 35 year old

1317
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.300
black man, and I wish I had sent you a picture so

1318
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.800
you could put it up on the screen, but it's a really beautiful picture of this

1319
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.000
man at the

1320
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.300
end of our community group and we're just spending time hanging out eating food

1321
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.600
and stuff like that together. He just is sitting over

1322
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.400
there with us.

1323
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:48.700
like this

1324
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.500
listening to my father-in-law

1325
01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:56.300
Tell stories and my friends I think that's how

1326
01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.700
like one of the ways that we're going

1327
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.100
to see change. Can we open our

1328
01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:02.900
homes up?

1329
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.300
Sometimes we we spend a lot of time getting mad at everybody else.

1330
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.800
We want them to solve the problems. We want some government

1331
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.000
organization to solve the problem when we want the

1332
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:18.000
church to solve the problem. But when

1333
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.800
are we going to start taking responsibility and

1334
01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.500
opening up our homes and opening

1335
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.600
up our lives that other people can receive the

1336
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.700
blessing of knowing Jesus and I

1337
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.400
can receive the blessing of knowing Jesus from

1338
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:32.600
them.

1339
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.300
Yeah, yeah.

1340
01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.700
I think as I've been

1341
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.200
Thinking about that question. And you said that earlier Phil and I appreciate that

1342
01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.900
one thing I thought about is.

1343
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.700
Is I think start Where You Are.

1344
01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:49.900
Start Where You Are.

1345
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:54.300
If you try to go across the street to minister,

1346
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:56.200
but your own house isn't necessarily in order.

1347
01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.500
You're not gonna have integrity in the process.

1348
01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.000
think about act six

1349
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.200
the apostles are faced with this issue of

1350
01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.100
the Greek speaking widows are being neglected and people who brought

1351
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.200
that issue to them were.

1352
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.600
were the Greek speaking members of the congregation and

1353
01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.200
so I think there's a reality of just like I

1354
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.300
would just encourage you Henderson just to look around.

1355
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.700
And see where's the diversity in this church?

1356
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:25.800
Do you know them?

1357
01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.200
Have you invited them into your home do you eat with them?

1358
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.200
Are you doing it here? Because I think I had a buddy of mine

1359
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.900
say it doesn't work here don't export it. I think

1360
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.200
we've got to have integrity to the process. And so

1361
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.600
I think we've got to be listening to each other even in our own congregation.

1362
01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.600
I'll say three quick things real quick one.

1363
01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.500
I just want everyone in the room to

1364
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:54.700
hear.

1365
01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.700
That there's not a heavy burden of condemnation for

1366
01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.000
our failures, but we're all forgiven and

1367
01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.700
there's no condemnation in Christ Jesus and really what there is is just an invitation

1368
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.200
to Greater Joy and new family.

1369
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.100
Because the grace of Jesus so when we're talking about this is not like

1370
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.200
we're doing it so bad. We got to figure out how to solve and it fixes

1371
01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.100
like hey, Jesus loves us right in the mix of our

1372
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.200
Brokenness and he's just saying come find the

1373
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.400
family that I've been preparing for you. That's the invitation. Second

1374
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.900
thing is as we think about

1375
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.100
Starting close to home. I think that starts off

1376
01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.500
and with our own household and with our own local church, but also

1377
01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.500
sometimes I think in America in particular, we've been

1378
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.200
very good at sending internationally, but haven't really dealt with the things

1379
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.300
in our own City and our own community. And as as we

1380
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.800
deal with that, I would just have two suggestions. One of them is there are

1381
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.100
really Godly wise christ-centered

1382
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.000
Spirit-filled biblical.

1383
01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.800
People of color pastors leaders who

1384
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.900
are constantly creating spaces

1385
01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.400
for the people of God to come together and know each other and listen

1386
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.200
and learn and showing up for those things would be a great idea.

1387
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.700
and I mean, I just mentioned one Clarence Hill that

1388
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.200
Jared just mentioned Clarence Hill Jr. Has been a

1389
01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:11.900
tremendous.

1390
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.700
Christ-centered peacemaking racial reconciliation leader

1391
01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.500
in Oklahoma for a long time and the stronger together movements got

1392
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:22.300
a couple events coming up a peace walk on April

1393
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.300
16th. I think the 60 year

1394
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.600
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. Letter from Birmingham Jail and that

1395
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.200
would be a great time to show up listen in prayer walk

1396
01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.000
with some saints.

1397
01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.200
And then in October, there's going to be a neighbor's conference where

1398
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.200
there's going to be an opportunity for a diverse group of people to sit at the

1399
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.100
feet of a diverse group of people talking about how do we love our neighbors? Well in this

1400
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.300
city and that would be a great opportunity to show up and so I'm not I don't know the holy

1401
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.200
spirit's calling you to those particular events though. I would love to see you there. But there

1402
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.400
are people that are creating those spaces. And

1403
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.100
the last thing that I would say is sometimes when we think

1404
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.400
about the call to die to ourselves and suffering for Jesus and sharing

1405
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.600
and the sufferings of Christ Christians in

1406
01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.300
America. We kind of do this thing where it's like man overseas they're suffering

1407
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.100
but we're so complacent here and we got to go overseas because that's where the real mission

1408
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.700
is. But here's the thing if some of those stats that were dropped a

1409
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:09.000
second ago,

1410
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.100
about lifespans

1411
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.200
correlated to color-coded zip codes in this city.

1412
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.600
Or about education attainments in this city, if we

1413
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.300
just think about the people about that for a

1414
01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.400
second and say I want to love my neighbor as

1415
01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.400
myself which means I care as much

1416
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.200
about their kids succeeding academically as I care

1417
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.800
about my kids exceeding academically.

1418
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.400
I care not only about their spiritual well-being but about

1419
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.400
their career opportunities just like for myself or

1420
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.900
for my children if we just take that really seriously, we

1421
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.200
won't have to have persecutors. We're just going to suffer because

1422
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.200
we got a lot of hard work to do.

1423
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.100
And a lot it's just inconvenient and it takes

1424
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.800
Paradigm shifts and it makes Church less comfortable and more exciting

1425
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.300
because the spirit of God will be on the move. So I think that's where

1426
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:57.800
I was done.

1427
01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.000
We've got two minutes before they let our kids loose so.

1428
01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:09.100
Anyway, I just want us to pray together just back here for just a second.

1429
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.900
Just through just a spirit of humility answer

1430
01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.100
this question in your heart.

1431
01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.300
Am I stuck?

1432
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.700
In the way, I view my responsibility.

1433
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.200
for racial reconciliation

1434
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.700
and in the next question would be

1435
01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:37.100
who could I have into my home?

1436
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:38.800
this next year

1437
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.400
to show them the love of Jesus.

1438
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.400
And lastly ask yourself.

1439
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.800
will I pray for my brothers and sisters and

1440
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.400
the South Oklahoma City in in East, Oklahoma City

1441
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.600
We'll let Joe finish us off.

1442
01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.100
Father we're so grateful.

1443
01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.700
Grateful that we've been called to you.

1444
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.600
grateful that

1445
01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.300
you call us your children that we've been adopted into your

1446
01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:15.500
family.

1447
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.000
And father, it's a family. That's much bigger

1448
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.900
than sometimes we think.

1449
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.400
and we have

1450
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.900
a brothers and sisters

1451
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.900
Who are different than us? And

1452
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.800
you'll forgive us father for

1453
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.600
seeking comfort and seeking

1454
01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.800
normalcy

1455
01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.200
And father I pray that you would just

1456
01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.000
put on our hearts.

1457
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.100
a spirit of Adventure

1458
01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.900
to understand the blessing that's out there for us.

1459
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.900
as we learn to reach out to someone that

1460
01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:57.200
we may have perceived as other someone that doesn't

1461
01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.300
look like us.

1462
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.300
father there's tremendous blessing in that there's

1463
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.400
your Holy Spirit

1464
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.400
and dwells

1465
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.200
these folks as well.

1466
01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.300
And so father I pray that.

1467
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.600
We would just open our minds to the opportunity for

1468
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.000
blessing that's out there.

1469
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:20.300
as we

1470
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:26.600
push past some of our almost self-imposed barriers

1471
01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:27.900
that we have

1472
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.500
for we know

1473
01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.100
that your eye is on the sparrow and those

1474
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:39.500
children

1475
01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:41.700
those people

1476
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.200
that you love

1477
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.700
that we can come alongside and minister to

1478
01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.500
There's blessing in that Ministry.

1479
01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.300
Father as we live out the opportunity.

1480
01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.500
to be that Revelation 7 picture

1481
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.400
not necessarily all homogenized into

1482
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400
one soup.

1483
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.500
But in supporting and loving each other even in our own different cultures.

1484
01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.300
And that that happens because we had

1485
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.500
have relationships.

1486
01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.700
And so I just pray that we just reach out to that

1487
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.800
someone.

1488
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:23.000
Or make some inquiries.

1489
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.100
Do some reading.

1490
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.700
By that we would know your heart.

1491
01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.200
Even better. So we thank you for this time

1492
01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.300
today. We thank you.

1493
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.500
For Jared and Chauncey John Mark, Asian, Phil.

1494
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.900
for setting this up and

1495
01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.700
for sharing their hearts

1496
01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:44.400
father

1497
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.800
they are serving you they're living you through this.

1498
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.300
And thank thank you.

1499
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.000

1500
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:55.600
to us tonight.

1501

We give you praise and we give you thanks and the precious name

1502
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.800

1503

Let's give our panel one. Great. Thank you.
