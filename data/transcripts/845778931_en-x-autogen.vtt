1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.130
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.810
I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.610
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.930
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.210
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.410
Good morning. My name's Alan Rice.

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.410
I'm a pastor elder here for 21 years and our lead teaching Pastor

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.010
John, uh,

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.410
he has been on sabbatical for three months and we've had a number of

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.530
really, uh, great preachers fill in. I'm not one of them, uh,

11
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.850
but uh, I am the last one. The bottom of the barrel.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.650
John will be back next week.

13
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.730
Now I'm gonna start our sermon off this morning with a story of one of my

14
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.330
adventures for some reason known only to God.

15
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.970
He seems to throw some pretty wild adventures my way from time to time

16
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.010
adventures I shouldn't experience as an English professor now retired

17
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.330
and as a pastor elder, it was Monday,

18
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.250
June 9th, 2008. I was nearly 50 years old at the time.

19
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.770
The location was AK Garri Island on the barren coast of Northern Ireland.

20
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.410
My lovely wife Deedee and I were on vacation doing the self tour

21
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.370
of all the countries of Great Britain. Now,

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.490
AK Garri Island is a natural tower of stone surrounded on all sides by

23
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.930
massive cliffs that go down to the jagged rocks by the sea.

24
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.810
We stood on the highest point of the island and looked out at a spectacular view

25
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.770
about 220 foot height over the broad and open ocean.

26
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.170
Now if you look at the picture up here, these cliffs look nice,

27
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.650
but to see the grand scale,

28
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.210
if you go to the far left to the top of the cliff and the grass,

29
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.250
you can see some lines of white going along a line.

30
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.770
Those are human beings.

31
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.730
That's how massive these cliffs are.

32
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.210
We took a deep breath and we soaked it all in.

33
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.650
Deedee sat down on a tuft of grass to meditate and pray.

34
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.810
I walked forward to get a better view of the sea. Don't go near the cliff.

35
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.530
Deedee warned I choke to myself because I wasn't that stupid.

36
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.690
So when I came to the cliff's edge,

37
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.810
I might be inclined to walk up to the very edge like this and look over,

38
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.050
but I was smarter than that because that little section could fall away.

39
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.810
So instead I did a wide stance like this with my,

40
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.050
my foot on my back or my weight on my back foot.

41
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.690
And I approached the cliff like this and before I could even look over the

42
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.010
whole large section fell away.

43
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.220
Now I had a lot of thoughts go through my head at that second as you can guess,

44
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.580
but one thought that I had was, come on,

45
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.340
I was doing the whole spreading leg thing. I mean,

46
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.740
what are the odds of that whole section falling away?

47
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.380
And my second thought was completely calm, crystal clear. It's this,

48
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.180
I'm gonna die. And I wasn't mournful about it or panicking,

49
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.620
it was just a scientific fact. Okay, fair enough.

50
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.500
But my third thought was, I'm really fascinated how I'm gonna die.

51
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.260
I mean, am I gonna sail 20 stories,

52
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.180
watching my the rocks come up and see them as I hit?

53
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.340
Am I gonna pass out from horror? Am I gonna hit my head on the cliff?

54
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.420
I was really interested in what was gonna come next.

55
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.940
So when I fell, my feet came together and my head went up.

56
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.020
So I didn't get to see what happened next,

57
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.340
but I felt a really hard bump on where I sit down on the right,

58
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.140
I guess as I came down I hit a jagged rock. I didn't hang up,

59
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.700
but it might have slowed me down. The next thing, boom,

60
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.780
both of my feet hit solid rock

61
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.180
and it was such a strong force downward from my fall that I

62
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.253
stumbled forward.

63
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.540
And now I am with my toes over the edge of the cliff looking 20

64
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.740
stories down and I'm ah, ah, and then I back up to the cliff.

65
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.860
I look up,

66
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.620
I have fallen 15 feet down a shear cliff and I'm only on a ledge

67
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.540
about five foot wide and about four foot between me and death.

68
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.580
I am stranded on a shear cliff all alone without help or hope

69
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.140
when I preach,

70
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.980
I like to state my thesis right up front so everyone can follow what I'm trying

71
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.420
to say today.

72
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.420
My thesis is really a kind of a theme and it's just four words long and it's the

73
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.580
top of the sermon notes.

74
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.620
It is this far away from home

75
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.260
standing on that little cliff overlooking a 20 story drop.

76
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.020
I was far away from home.

77
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.980
I was far away from home from the red dirt plains of Oklahoma and I felt

78
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.700
equally as far away from home from my lovely wife who was only physically about

79
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.060
a hundred yards away, far away from home.

80
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.140
Today we're reading from Psalm 61,

81
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.220
I will read the whole psalm aloud from the English standard version and then

82
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.940
we'll go back and analyze it bit by bit

83
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.260
to the choir master with string instruments of David.

84
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.100
Hear my cry. Oh God, listen to my prayer.

85
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.580
From the end of the earth I call to you. When my heart is faint,

86
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.380
lead me to the rock that is higher than I for you have been

87
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.100
my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.

88
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.700
Let me dwell in your tent forever.

89
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.540
Let me take refuge a under the shelter of your wings,

90
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.620
Sayah for you, oh God have heard my vows,

91
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.540
you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.

92
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.500
Prolong the life of the king. May his years endure to all generations.

93
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.220
May he be in enthroned forever before God appoint

94
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.420
steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him.

95
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.060
So will I ever sing praises to your name as I perform

96
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.940
my vows? Day after day

97
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.060
the Psalm starts out with David, uh, telling us the setting.

98
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.580
David is far away from home in verse one.

99
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.380
In the first part of verse two, David states hear my cry. Oh God,

100
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.580
listen to my prayer from the end of the earth,

101
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.700
I call to you when my heart is faint.

102
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.780
Why is David so distraught? Why is his heart so faint?

103
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.420
Because he is far away from home,

104
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.900
which is to say far away from God.

105
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.980
In the Old Testament, God is everywhere just as he is now omnipresent.

106
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.380
But in those days,

107
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.740
God chose especially to inhabit the Ark of the Covenant which was housed

108
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.500
in Jerusalem. So he uh, David was in Jerusalem,

109
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.140
that was his capital. So when he was there,

110
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.900
he was always close to the Ark of the Covenant and therefore he felt he was

111
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.100
close to God. But in this psalm,

112
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.020
David is obviously not near Jerusalem and therefore he is not close to

113
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.740
God. He is as he states at the ends of the earth.

114
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.300
Why might that be?

115
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.180
Most biblical commentators agree that it is probably because David is in the

116
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.500
part of his life when he had to flee Jerusalem

117
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.260
in about 10 30 BC when David was roughly 61 years old,

118
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.260
his son Absalom revolted against him, seized the throne,

119
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.860
and forced David to flee for his life in into the wild wilderness.

120
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.540
Now I've had the honor of visiting the Baron wilderness of Israel and it really

121
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.740
does feel like the end of the earth,

122
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.860
especially when compared to the city of Jerusalem,

123
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.100
cut off from his court, cut off from his homeland and cut off from his God.

124
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.100
David felt that he was at the end of the earth.

125
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.740
So sermon point number one, David is far away from home.

126
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.620
David's epic journey homeward in this psalm is universal in its themes.

127
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.420
Some of the world's most beloved heroes had to leave their home and found

128
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.260
themselves far away from home.

129
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.220
Odysseus and Homer's Odyssey,

130
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.900
Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz and Frodo and Lord of the Rings all were forced

131
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.980
away from their homes and went on long journeys to try to get

132
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.883
back.

133
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.860
This quest of the hero trying to find his or her way home is so mythic,

134
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.660
so resonant in our culture that without quite recognizing it,

135
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.220
we play games that reflect this journey of the hero,

136
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.660
the board game of life, of Candy Land, of Wahoo,

137
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.060
and especially of the board game. Parici, which I bought for this moment,

138
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.380
reflects this journey.

139
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.980
So in Parici you start all the way at the edge of the

140
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.420
board at the end of the world and you have to go on this

141
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.700
circuitous journey forever and your goal is to get to the center,

142
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.140
to Jerusalem, let's say, which says in big letters home.

143
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.140
And yet David's journey is different than that of the other heroes.

144
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.380
David doesn't use Odysseus's, brilliant intellectual,

145
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:26.300
cunning or Dorothy's ability to form a family or frodo's inner goodness

146
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.220
to get him through his journey,

147
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.300
but rather David overcomes all of his obstacles in his

148
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.220
path by his absolute dependence upon

149
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.393
God.

150
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.380
Notice that David focuses on his own inadequacy in this journey.

151
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.460
He admits in verse two that his heart is faint.

152
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.900
Furthermore, he calls upon God and God alone. When he writes,

153
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.340
hear my cry, oh God,

154
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.540
listen to my prayer from the end of the earth I call to you when

155
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.940
my heart is faint,

156
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.980
David cries out to God in desperation, he prays to God,

157
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.860
he he calls out to God because his heart is faint and he knows that he

158
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.580
cannot rely upon himself to get home.

159
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.180
When David was at his best,

160
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.980
he was like Jesus desperately dependent

161
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.243
upon God.

162
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.640
One of the very few bright spots I have in my personal Christian walk is

163
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.120
that I'm addicted to intimacy with God.

164
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.400
The New Testament calls intimacy with God,

165
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.680
walking in the Holy Spirit or walking in the light,

166
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.040
and that is my burning yearning desire every day As a Christian.

167
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.340
Deedee and I love an old Kerry Grant movie where he and his wife talk about the

168
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.700
deep intimacy between the two of them as being like an ongoing music,

169
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.140
a harmony in their hearts.

170
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:08.260
I long for that music between God and myself every day that walking in

171
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.420
the Holy, holy Spirit,

172
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.420
I get there like many Christians by practicing what are called the spiritual

173
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.253
disciplines.

174
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.220
For me that means a hunger for Bible study and a thirst for

175
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.060
meditation upon God and his word.

176
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.540
The sad news is I am not the most disciplined when it comes to long intense

177
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.540
prayer like I should be. But when I'm walking in the Holy Spirit,

178
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.460
at least I whisper conversational prayers with God all day

179
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.180
long. But something happens to me when I get sick.

180
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.300
I don't know why I go into robot mode and just

181
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.020
try to survive the brownish bra,

182
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.500
gray haze of life until I can feel better.

183
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.300
My Bible study time is mundane,

184
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.220
my meditation time is diminished and my whispered

185
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.180
conversations with God completely evaporate.

186
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.060
I keep thinking Tamara feel better and I can get back to real life.

187
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.940
But when I have a protracted illness,

188
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.860
I realize over time that I have not been walking in the Holy Spirit and I'm not

189
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.860
in harmony with God.

190
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.300
For the last year and a half I've been struggling with one protracted illness

191
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.940
after another from c o d to bronchitis, to pneumonia,

192
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.260
maybe twice because of my illness,

193
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.460
I have often failed to seek harmony with God and I feel that I

194
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.420
am sometimes spiritually anemic

195
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.363
like David.

196
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.860
I am sometimes far away from home,

197
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.460
but I think I'm not alone in this,

198
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.060
all of humanity feels the impact of being far away from home

199
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:03.963
with God.

200
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.500
The Bible tells us in the book of Genesis that when God created human beings,

201
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.100
Adam and Eve, they were in perfect harmony with God.

202
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.460
God could literally walk with Adam in the cool of the day,

203
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.300
but those first humans, Adam and Eve, chose to sin.

204
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.100
That is they chose to disobey God,

205
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.900
to revolt against him in their hearts and to obey their own impulses as

206
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.380
if they are their own gods.

207
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.740
Adam and Eve sin has influenced all human beings so that we all choose

208
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.740
to sin against God. Therefore,

209
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.380
we are cut off from harmony with God because God is so

210
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.020
absolutely pure and holy.

211
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.300
He cannot be in harmony with those people like all of us who

212
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.940
are corrupted by sin. However,

213
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.660
the writer of Ecclesiastes and Ecclesiastes three 11 states

214
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.980
that God has placed eternity in our human hearts.

215
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:20.140
Therefore, we all yearn for that harmony with God that is missing

216
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.793
in our lives.

217
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.140
Every civilization in the world seems to know this is true.

218
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.180
They know there's a God, they yearn for him,

219
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.980
and yet they also know we are all separated from him.

220
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.500
Every civilization tries to reach their arms up to God,

221
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.660
to close that gap between God and humanity.

222
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.300
People have tried to reach up to God by, by prayers,

223
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.740
by rituals, by fasting, by self denial,

224
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.900
by good works, by animal sacrifices to idols,

225
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.180
by ceremonious cutting themselves,

226
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.500
even by sacrificing their children on the fire of pagan altars.

227
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.140
But nothing seems to close that infinite gap between humanity and God.

228
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.740
Nothing can bring us the intimacy with him that our hearts

229
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.140
crave. Sermon note number two,

230
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.860
we were all,

231
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.620
all of us far away from home.

232
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.140
Let's finish reading the rest of verse two. From the end of the earth,

233
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.140
I call to you, when my heart is faint,

234
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.340
lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

235
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.900
What is this rock At the literal level,

236
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.660
it's just a natural tower of cliffs, of of rock with cliffs on all sides.

237
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.700
The perfect place for a British isles to put a castle or an Israel.

238
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.140
Masada is such a place.

239
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.860
So what David is saying that he wants to God to take him to the top of a tower

240
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.380
of rock so David will be safe and secure from all of his enemies.

241
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.740
Why does David need God to take him to such a place?

242
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.820
Because if David could climb up there,

243
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.140
then so could his enemies and it wouldn't be safe and secure. After all,

244
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.380
David is yearning for a safety for a security that only God

245
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.180
can provide. As I was standing on that little legend,

246
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.180
Northern Ireland overlooking a terrifying 200 foot

247
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.293
plunge to death,

248
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.180
I could well have sympathized with David's desire for God to take him

249
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.940
to that rock that was higher than himself

250
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.580
at the literal level. The rock in verse two is a just a high tower of rock,

251
00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.100
but at the figurative or the metaphorical level,

252
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.180
the rock is God and God alone

253
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.540
As he was in verse one,

254
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.140
David is being totally dependent upon God here

255
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.180
He yearns for God to take him to that higher rock,

256
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.580
which is the only place of real safety and security.

257
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.220
Many of us in this room might try to find safety and security and money

258
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.860
that is until it's gone.

259
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.340
We might try to find safety and security in our job, in our status,

260
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.300
in our families, in our health until they're gone.

261
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:43.340
Such things only give us the illusion of safety because they are here with us on

262
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.540
this lowly ground.

263
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.300
Only God can lead us to the rock to himself that is higher

264
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:51.963
than ourselves.

265
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.380
Has God ever been a rock for you in your life?

266
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.820
Only God can lead us to the point of living for something higher,

267
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.140
something grander than our own lives.

268
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.580
Sermon note number three,

269
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.820
only in the rock of God can we find safety and

270
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.053
security.

271
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.140
How can we know for sure that the rock in verse two is metaphorically really

272
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.620
God? Because David makes it crystal clear in verse three,

273
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.580
for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.

274
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.060
So David states outright here that God has been David's rock, his refuge,

275
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.260
his strong tower in times past,

276
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.020
and David is pleading with God to be so once again in this dark

277
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.940
hour And then things get even sweeter and deeper.

278
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.780
In verse four, when David writes,

279
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.500
let me dwell in your tent forever.

280
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.740
Notice that David isn't just asking for mere safety and security here.

281
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.700
He's asking for a real relationship with God

282
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.780
according to the Hebrew scholars of the new English translation,

283
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.940
the English phrase,

284
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.100
let me dwell in your tent in the Hebrew of Psalm 61 really

285
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.640
means,

286
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.500
let me live as a resident foreigner in your tent as

287
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.420
a resident foreigner.

288
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.220
David acknowledges here that he's not worthy of citizenship in God's kingdom.

289
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.260
He is far away from home.

290
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.620
He is a human being who is sinful and fallen, but even as a foreigner,

291
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.420
he wants God to grant him the legal right to dwell as a

292
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.140
resident in the tense of God so he can be nearer to God

293
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.380
as people who sin.

294
00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.020
We cannot expect or demand that God embrace us in our fallen state,

295
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.220
but like David,

296
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.180
we can cry out to God that he would somehow make us able to be

297
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.460
in his presence.

298
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.980
Notice that David isn't just talking anymore about shelter from his

299
00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.540
enemies on this earth.

300
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.900
He has transcended focusing upon getting back to Jerusalem to the physical

301
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.140
arch, the covenant and now is asking instead for God to let him come

302
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.220
to his real home

303
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.940
in God's presence for eternity.

304
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.980
Notice how David calls after God to let him dwell as a resident for and God's

305
00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.220
tent, but notice the following word forever.

306
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.580
So sermon note number four,

307
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.900
God can give us a new home with him.

308
00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.740
Then comes an even sweeter,

309
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.580
an even deeper moment as we read the rest of verse four.

310
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.940
Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings.

311
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.500
David is metaphorically describing God as a mother bird gathering little birds

312
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.460
under her wing in a time of danger.

313
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:17.180
Jesus uses this same metaphor of himself and elaborates upon it a little in

314
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:22.140
Matthew 2337 O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem,

315
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.700
the city that kills the prophets and stones, those who are sent to it.

316
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.620
How often I would gather have gathered your children together as a hen gathers

317
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.020
her brood under her wings and you were not willing.

318
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.460
The mother hen here is providing safety and security for her chicks in a time of

319
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.293
danger,

320
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.260
but David covered that concept and the rock that is higher than eye passage.

321
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.260
So I think this mother hen metaphor is emphasizing two additional things

322
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.180
to safety and security.

323
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.420
The first thing I noticed here is intimacy.

324
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.380
In the passage we'd read earlier,

325
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.100
David pleased to be a resident foreigner in one of God's tens.

326
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.620
But here the relationship is much more intimate.

327
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.420
Here David is calling out to God to take him under his wings.

328
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.580
Snuggling up under God's wings is much more intimate than merely being in one of

329
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.900
God's tents, and in this metaphor,

330
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.380
David isn't some resident foreigner,

331
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.340
but rather he is one of God's own little chicks.

332
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:36.300
This metaphor makes David part of God's own family.

333
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.380
That is new, that is powerful.

334
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.860
The second thing I noticed here is not just safety and intimacy but also

335
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.533
sacrifice.

336
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.220
The mother hen gathers her chicks under her wing so that the predator,

337
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:58.260
like the fox, for example, will attack her and not her children.

338
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.260
She is literally laying her life down for her chicks

339
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.340
and that ladies and gentlemen is what Jesus Christ did

340
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.740
for all of us.

341
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.260
He was born as the only person in history who was a hundred percent God

342
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.900
and a hundred percent man.

343
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.740
He lived the perfectly sinless life that none of us could ever do,

344
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.140
and he sacrificed himself upon a cross to take all of our sins

345
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.020
upon him as we as He died.

346
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.420
If we become Christians,

347
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.900
that is if we accept Jesus as our savior to save us from our sins,

348
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.180
past, present, and future,

349
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.900
and as our Lord so that he is the person in charge of all the rest of our lives.

350
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:55.020
Jesus' sacrifice upon the cross takes away all of our sins

351
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.540
and restores that intimacy,

352
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.980
that harmony with God that we have always longed for.

353
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.020
We literally are adopted and become part of God's family

354
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.820
like little chicks under a mother's wing.

355
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.060
Sermon note number five,

356
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.460
sacrifice gives us our new home when we are

357
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.620
part of God's family.

358
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.580
We are no longer far away from home.

359
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.860
We are home. We are home at last.

360
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.980
David intuitively here knows this because for the rest of Psalm 61,

361
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.300
after the sayah, after the break,

362
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.860
he is no longer crying out and pleading to God as if he is far away

363
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.693
from home.

364
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.180
But rather he speaks with the deep assurance of someone who knows

365
00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:00.460
he's in full harmony with God. Verse five, for you,

366
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.140
oh God have heard my vows,

367
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.460
you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.

368
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.780
The heritage David speaks of here is that heritage of intimacy,

369
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.860
of harmony with God and ultimately of living forever with

370
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.740
him as a part of God's family.

371
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.740
The final verses of the Psalm shift to David praying for blessings upon

372
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.713
the king.

373
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.260
Verse six and following,

374
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.060
Prolong the life of the king. May his years endure to all generations.

375
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.620
May he be enthroned forever before God appoint

376
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.180
steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him.

377
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.180
So while I ever sing praises to your name, as I perform my vows day after day,

378
00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.100
who is this king that David is praying for? Is it himself?

379
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:01.720
If so,

380
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.420
why does he suddenly refer to himself in the distant third person as he and as

381
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.980
the king when the previous passages or in the first passionate direct first

382
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.740
person of I and me? Most biblical commentators see two kings here,

383
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.060
both at the same time.

384
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.820
The first king is indeed David himself.

385
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.860
After his traumatic ordeal with his son and Absalom's revolt,

386
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.940
David is asking for God to give him long life and to bless and restore his

387
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.220
kingdom with love and with faithfulness.

388
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.020
David seems to have faith here that God will restore and bless him and therefore

389
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.620
David dedicates himself to honor God with his vows and to continually

390
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.620
sing praises to him.

391
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.820
As is so often the case with the psalm, the psalmist starts out,

392
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.460
the Psalm gripped with panic,

393
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.020
looking at the dire circumstances of this chaotic world,

394
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:02.020
but ends the Psalm in peace and harmony as he is now focusing

395
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.220
upward upon God.

396
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.820
So far so great and yet there is

397
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.060
something in the wording of these last three verses that seem to transcend am

398
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.860
mere call for blessings upon David the king.

399
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.860
It's as if David has achieved such harmony with God that the end of this psalm,

400
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.940
he has slipped into the future prediction of prophecy

401
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.420
As many but biblical commentators believe David is speaking of himself,

402
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.500
but he is more profoundly speaking of a second king. Jesus,

403
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.980
the Messiah who is to come.

404
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.870
Verse six, prolong the life of the king.

405
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.350
May his years endure to all generations.

406
00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.550
David's life cannot endure to all generations,

407
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:57.910
but Jesus the Son has always been and always will

408
00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.043
be.

409
00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:05.070
He is here with us now and he will be with us

410
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:10.190
for all generations no matter how wildly this world spins out of

411
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.390
control. Verse seven,

412
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:18.510
may he be enthroned forever before God appoint

413
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.390
steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him.

414
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.670
40 days after Jesus rose from the dead,

415
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.150
he ascended and into heaven before the eyes of his disciples,

416
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.350
and he now sits at the right hand of the Father.

417
00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.750
Literally as this verse states enthroned forever before

418
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.443
God.

419
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:41.963
Amen.

420
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.210
Steadfast love and faithfulness. Don't just watch over Jesus,

421
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.810
but rather Jesus's steadfast love and faithfulness watches

422
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.650
over us. Verse eight,

423
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:59.370
so will I ever sing praises to your name as I perform my vows

424
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.970
day after day,

425
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.090
even as David vows to serve God his Lord.

426
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:11.170
So we too live our lives every day in service to our savior

427
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:16.410
and our forever Lord, always singing praises to his name.

428
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.930
Let us remember that in just a few minutes as we sing praise to our God,

429
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.770
I began this sermon with a literal cliffhanger.

430
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.370
What happened to me on that tiny ledge with the horrifying drop below,

431
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:38.690
I was in such a state of adrenaline shock that without really thinking it

432
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:39.450
through,

433
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:44.130
I immediately turned and began trying to scale that 15 foot

434
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.093
shear cliff.

435
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.730
I was hoping that deedee hadn't seen me fall and that I could make it back up

436
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.450
the cliff without her knowing that I fell.

437
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.650
Don't go near the cliff

438
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.690
as I was crawling my way up the side,

439
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.810
I vaguely remember handholds and footholds slipping beneath my weight and rocks

440
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.090
and pebbles falling down the cliff below.

441
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.010
But I was obsessed with getting to Deedee,

442
00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.050
Looking back at it all. Now,

443
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.650
if someone had airlifted me to that little ledge and left me there,

444
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.690
I never in a million years would try to climb that cliff.

445
00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.290
The odds of falling to my death would seem overwhelming,

446
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:31.010
but I was in the adrenaline shock zone, so I kept climbing.

447
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:37.330
I got safely to the top of the cliff and crawled 20 feet or so onto the

448
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.970
ground, beyond rolled over, laid on my back for perhaps a minute,

449
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.650
just trying to understand what just happened here.

450
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.290
Then I turned and crawled over to the cliff's edge again like an idiot it.

451
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.650
But this time I slithered forward on my stomach

452
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:02.290
and I stared over the edge of more than 20 stories below to those jagged rocks,

453
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:08.210
and I looked up the cliff face as far as I could see to the left.

454
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.850
I looked up the cliff face as far as I could see to the right,

455
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.570
and the only ledge in all the cliff face was that little four foot ledge

456
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.290
directly below me.

457
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.450
I've had many near-death experiences in my life.

458
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.730
Here are just a few examples. I've been attacked by a mad bull.

459
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.450
Years later I was attacked by a homicidal cow.

460
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.540
I've had a heart pounding close encounter with a mountain lion in the wilderness

461
00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.740
with my leg bleeding to lure them on.

462
00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.460
I've been trailed by a pack of hungry wolves in the Rocky Mountains at midnight

463
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.180
and once coming back from a mission trip to Wales,

464
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.300
our United Airlines commercial jet lost an engine over the

465
00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.413
Atlantic Ocean.

466
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.540
Stephanie Miller was on that flight with me.

467
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.260
I don't remember who else was there.

468
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:11.380
I've since read online that only one in a million flights lose an engine.

469
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.340
Therefore, for what happened to you,

470
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.300
you could reasonably say that's some pretty bad luck.

471
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.020
But of all the adventures I've experienced,

472
00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:25.340
I would rank my fall off the cliff in Northern Ireland as the one most

473
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.980
overwhelmingly likely to kill me.

474
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.260
The second I went over that edge,

475
00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.940
I would say my odds were absolutely zero.

476
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.940
Why am I alive? Why did God let me live?

477
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.773
I don't know.

478
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.180
Did he have an angel pushing me up the cliff from behind as the hand holes gave

479
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.340
way? I don't know. Maybe

480
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.500
I won't say that I'm haunted by this, but when I think about that cliff,

481
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.700
I often look up my life to see if there's anything in it that might be the

482
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.580
reason for God to keep me from dying that day and all those other days of my

483
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.140
crazy adventures. And I have to tell you honestly, church,

484
00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.780
I don't see it. I haven't found the cure for cancer.

485
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.460
I haven't run into a burning building to save a school full of children.

486
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:26.140
Even when I add up all the component parts of my life, my role in my family,

487
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.420
my work, our church, our missions to wells,

488
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.940
it just doesn't amount enough to help me understand.

489
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.660
I don't see enough merit in all that I am and all that I've done to warrant

490
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:44.380
surviving such ridiculous odds no matter how hard I

491
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.780
added up. But I think that's the point.

492
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:54.100
There's nothing that I've done that might be enough for God to let me live that

493
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:54.933
day,

494
00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.160
and that is the definition of grace.

495
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.000
There's nothing in my life good enough for God to save me in Northern Ireland,

496
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:11.160
and there's nothing good enough in our lives for God to save us from our sins

497
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.000
and to adopt us into his family.

498
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.920
It is just grace.

499
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.070
It is just Jesus being Jesus.

500
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.070
It is just Jesus being the rock.

501
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:30.270
Sermon note number six,

502
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.550
grace and grace alone through faith brings us home.

503
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:41.340
What are the cliff ledges you are stranded upon in your life?

504
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.250
It could be a struggle with a family member or a friend.

505
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:51.170
It could be bad news about your job or your health,

506
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:56.050
or it could be anxiety, depression, or addiction.

507
00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.090
Maybe you just feel far away from God.

508
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.970
Know that you are not alone on that ledge.

509
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.690
God sees you. God's got you.

510
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.210
Jesus is the rock that is higher than us.

511
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.530
Maybe you can remember how you ran under his wings in times past.

512
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.770
He is here now just like he was then,

513
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:34.770
and he wants to be in sweet harmony with you and me.

514
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.050
I'll be here in the front at the end of our service, so will other elders,

515
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.250
staff members, counselors, we'd love to talk with you and pray with you.
