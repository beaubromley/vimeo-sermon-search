1
00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.295
It's great to see you church.

2
00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:23.655
Uh, it is hard to express how much I love getting

3
00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:25.095
to be one of your pastors.

4
00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:29.255
Uh, your constant encouragement and love for me

5
00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.575
and your hunger for the word

6
00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:34.215
and hunger for worship, it spurs me on

7
00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:36.975
and encourages me to keep going

8
00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:40.935
and to keep getting better at what I do in my role.

9
00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:42.255
So thank you for that.

10
00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:47.055
Today though, we come to another really hard passage

11
00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:51.615
of scripture and in very real and raw ways.

12
00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:56.055
What we saw Nathan prophesy about David

13
00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.455
and his family last week.

14
00:00:57.475 --> 00:01:01.375
It, it only goes from bad to worse in these ways.

15
00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.055
And, and honestly, there are some

16
00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:06.615
really sensitive topics in these two chapters.

17
00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:10.215
And so I wanna be cautious with this

18
00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.815
and where we walk into this today.

19
00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:15.975
I'm not trying to avoid what's in these chapters.

20
00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.415
We clearly are just working through the book,

21
00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:23.895
but I might skip reading some sections for a couple reasons.

22
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.815
First, because for you as parents, I want you to be able

23
00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:30.255
to have those conversations with your kids on your timing

24
00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:33.495
and your way, not just kind of lay it on

25
00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:35.455
and then you have to deal with it.

26
00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:38.135
Uh, but also secondly,

27
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:41.575
because I know that some of you in this room have

28
00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.575
experienced horrific things similar

29
00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:47.415
to what's in these chapters.

30
00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.175
And so I wanna be really careful with that.

31
00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:57.775
Wanna be cautious and not flippant about it

32
00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:02.855
yet, I also wanna say that if that's you,

33
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:07.135
if you have experienced some things like that, what you went

34
00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:11.605
through was wrong, and we want to be there

35
00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:14.565
for you if we can, and care for you

36
00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:17.405
and pray for you, find resources

37
00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:19.805
for you if you would allow that for us.

38
00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.775
And so in light of all that, I think we need to pray

39
00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:27.495
before we get into God's word today.

40
00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:32.055
So, Lord, this is your word, as hard

41
00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:33.375
as it is often to read.

42
00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.015
So I pray, Lord, that you just wash over this whole thing

43
00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:41.855
with grace and mercy, meeting people in their time of need,

44
00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:48.225
challenging us to flee sin,

45
00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:53.975
to encouraging us to follow you,

46
00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.335
to rest and lean on you, Lord, may this,

47
00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:04.025
this passage today propel us even deeper towards

48
00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:08.305
a trust in you, no matter the circumstance

49
00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:12.025
and the chaos around us, no matter what happens to us,

50
00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:15.185
no matter what we see in the world, no matter anything,

51
00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:16.385
we trust you.

52
00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:21.545
Help us towards that today as we look forward

53
00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:23.905
to the day when there's no more pain, no more sorrow,

54
00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:25.225
no more sin, no more death.

55
00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:31.015
Come quickly, Lord Jesus, help us today. In Jesus' name.

56
00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:35.575
Amen. So here's what we've seen so far

57
00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:37.655
as we walk through Second Samuel.

58
00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.775
We've, we've seen that David was a partial fulfillment

59
00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:46.735
of the promise that God gave back in one Samuel

60
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:48.255
of this promised King.

61
00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:50.615
One. Samuel set us up for it and,

62
00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:53.695
and we saw Saul, uh, start with that process.

63
00:03:53.955 --> 00:03:56.015
He failed at that. And then David was

64
00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.495
anointed as the replacement.

65
00:03:57.515 --> 00:03:59.455
And so here what we've seen is second Samuels.

66
00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.855
You look at that chart, we've looked at most weeks, right?

67
00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:03.855
This, this idea of second Samuel is David

68
00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:05.135
rising to the throne.

69
00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:08.095
And so far to this point, he seems

70
00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:11.375
to have handled it all really well, God honoring kind

71
00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:15.255
of ways until last week

72
00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:18.855
in two Samuel 11 and 12,

73
00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:24.415
and David's catalog of sins against Bathsheba,

74
00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:26.095
against Uriah, against others.

75
00:04:27.155 --> 00:04:32.045
But ultimately we saw his sin against God was

76
00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:33.685
what set him and his family

77
00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:37.885
and his nation on a downward trajectory.

78
00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:43.065
Now, graciously, God still redeems.

79
00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.865
God continues to work both in

80
00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:48.065
and through David to bring about the Messiah a thousand

81
00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:51.585
years later in God's sovereign plan through David's family,

82
00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:54.905
but primarily strife

83
00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:59.985
and trouble dominated David's family life and beyond.

84
00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:04.295
And we'll see it very clearly

85
00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:09.375
starting here in chapters 13 and 14 of two Samuel.

86
00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:12.945
So here's how I want to go through this.

87
00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:16.785
So I want to first just track the passages plot,

88
00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:21.505
like find the narrative thread of what actually happened

89
00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:23.745
as we walk through these two chapters.

90
00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:25.065
So we just get the broad overview

91
00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:27.305
of the story, the narrative.

92
00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:30.865
Again, I'm not gonna read every word of these two chapters,

93
00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.465
but I'm gonna give you enough to, to be able

94
00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.025
to understand what's happening here.

95
00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.445
And it starts in verse one of chapter 13.

96
00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:45.165
Now, Absalom, David's son

97
00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:47.965
had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar.

98
00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:53.085
And after a time, Amon, David's son loved her.

99
00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:58.005
And so right off the bat, it gets weird right now, these,

100
00:05:58.005 --> 00:05:59.405
these are half siblings.

101
00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:05.525
Amon was David's son, oldest son from one of David's wives,

102
00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:07.485
and then Absalom and Tamar were brother

103
00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:10.605
and sister from another of David's wives.

104
00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:12.325
And so there were sibling, half siblings,

105
00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:14.885
all three from David.

106
00:06:16.395 --> 00:06:17.405
That doesn't make it right,

107
00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:22.285
but it does explain some of the rivalry that shows up

108
00:06:22.285 --> 00:06:23.925
through these families.

109
00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:28.685
Yet this was merely a symptom of a bigger problem.

110
00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:32.195
It was evidence of the curse.

111
00:06:33.055 --> 00:06:36.195
It it God put on David's family in a way

112
00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:38.115
through Nathan's prophecy

113
00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:40.635
that this was already showing up the family strife.

114
00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.635
That's part of it. But there was more,

115
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:48.475
there was also this from back in Deuteronomy 1717 when God

116
00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:50.355
originally gave the law to Israel.

117
00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:52.875
He said, a couple hundred years from now,

118
00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:54.315
you're going to want a king.

119
00:06:54.535 --> 00:06:56.115
Here's how that king needs to be.

120
00:06:58.055 --> 00:07:00.275
Listen to Deuteronomy 17, 17.

121
00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:05.195
God says, he the king shall not acquire many wives

122
00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:08.845
for himself, lest his heart turn away,

123
00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:14.305
nor shall he acquire for himself excessive silver and gold.

124
00:07:16.725 --> 00:07:17.865
Yet what did David do

125
00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:24.065
and what did many, most of the kings following him do?

126
00:07:26.005 --> 00:07:27.415
Well, partly due to lust

127
00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:29.975
and partly due to political maneuvering.

128
00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:31.055
They were just trying to make their,

129
00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:33.495
their status in the world better.

130
00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:37.135
They wrongly gained many wives.

131
00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:43.065
But just think about the environment that that created.

132
00:07:45.425 --> 00:07:49.045
It would create power plays, it would create family strife.

133
00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:52.845
It was an environment in which the prophecy Nathan said

134
00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.725
would come true of David's family.

135
00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:56.365
That's the environment.

136
00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:59.235
It would happen in just family

137
00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:01.475
dynamics to an extreme.

138
00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:08.705
And here in two Samuel 13, it began to play out that way.

139
00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:15.065
Now it said that Amon loved Tamar.

140
00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:17.825
It was not true love.

141
00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:20.465
I would more classify it as lust,

142
00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:25.625
where he made himself physically sick

143
00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.305
because he loved Tamar so much,

144
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.185
he desired her so much.

145
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:35.745
Well, what happens throughout the rest of the chapter is

146
00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:37.985
that he would scheme away

147
00:08:39.245 --> 00:08:41.105
to get her to come to him.

148
00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:42.265
He acted as sick.

149
00:08:42.725 --> 00:08:46.505
He made himself, uh, kind of a bed in his room

150
00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:50.945
and he invited through David Tamar

151
00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:53.545
to come make him some food to make him feel better.

152
00:08:53.975 --> 00:08:56.045
Unwittingly, David participates in this.

153
00:08:56.045 --> 00:08:57.285
He doesn't know anything's going on.

154
00:08:57.585 --> 00:08:59.965
And so he says, okay, Tamar, you go to Amon.

155
00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:02.805
And as she came into his private bedroom,

156
00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:05.405
Amon violated Tamar.

157
00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:12.695
And I want you just to think the generational echo

158
00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:14.135
is deafening here.

159
00:09:15.865 --> 00:09:18.075
Does it not sound parallel to

160
00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:20.635
what David just did a couple chapters ago?

161
00:09:25.215 --> 00:09:29.555
And of course, Tamar is grieved beyond words over

162
00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:30.595
what has just happened.

163
00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:33.155
And so she runs to her brother Absalom's house,

164
00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:36.195
who protects her, provides for her,

165
00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:40.635
and begins to breed this hatred towards am

166
00:09:40.655 --> 00:09:42.435
not for what he'd done.

167
00:09:46.015 --> 00:09:47.075
But what did David do?

168
00:09:49.275 --> 00:09:51.045
Well, look down at verse 21.

169
00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:58.405
All this has happened. Watch what happens.

170
00:09:58.405 --> 00:10:03.325
Verse 21, when King David heard of all these things,

171
00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:05.285
he was very angry.

172
00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:12.075
That's it. Like that, that's all it says.

173
00:10:14.275 --> 00:10:16.925
Some manuscripts add, maybe a little questionable,

174
00:10:16.925 --> 00:10:20.725
but they add something like he was, he was loving Amon

175
00:10:20.725 --> 00:10:22.485
as his oldest more than anyone else.

176
00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:26.485
Whatever it was, we don't know either way.

177
00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:31.125
He didn't do anything. He didn't do anything about this.

178
00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:34.365
Now, was it because he knew that if he would judge Amon for

179
00:10:34.365 --> 00:10:37.605
what Amon had just done, that he would condemn himself for

180
00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:41.475
what he had just done with Bathsheba possibly.

181
00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:45.805
So he just kind of abdicates any responsibility as a father,

182
00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:47.005
and he just says, ah, no,

183
00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:48.645
I'm not gonna do anything either way.

184
00:10:49.355 --> 00:10:52.365
Tragedy had struck David's family

185
00:10:55.675 --> 00:10:59.095
and we, we rejoice Psalm 51, we saw last week

186
00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:01.935
that God forgave David's sin against heaven,

187
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:06.405
but God did not remove sins.

188
00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:09.125
Earthly shadow from David's family.

189
00:11:11.725 --> 00:11:15.135
This is what we experience here in this passage.

190
00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:17.885
Well watch what happens next.

191
00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:19.845
It only goes from bad to worse.

192
00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:21.885
Verse 23,

193
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:30.055
after two full years, Absalom had sheep shears at Baal Hazo,

194
00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:31.375
which is near Ephraim.

195
00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:34.095
And Absalom invited all the king sons.

196
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:36.175
And Absalom came to the king

197
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.095
and said, behold, your servant has sheep shears.

198
00:11:38.095 --> 00:11:39.855
Please let me please let the king

199
00:11:39.855 --> 00:11:41.255
and his servants go with your servant.

200
00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.535
But the king said to Absalom, no, my son,

201
00:11:44.555 --> 00:11:46.855
let us not all go lest we be burdensome to you.

202
00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:49.855
So Absalom pressed him, but he would not go,

203
00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.015
but gave him his blessing.

204
00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:53.055
And Absalom said, if not, please let my brother,

205
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.805
brother Amon go with us.

206
00:11:56.575 --> 00:11:58.555
And the king said to him, why should he go with you?

207
00:11:58.575 --> 00:12:00.755
But Absalom pressed him until he let Amon

208
00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:02.275
and all the king's sons go with him.

209
00:12:04.215 --> 00:12:07.865
Then Absalom commanded his servants, mark,

210
00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:10.265
when Amons heart is Mer with wine.

211
00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:13.385
And when I say to you, strike Amon, then kill him.

212
00:12:14.445 --> 00:12:16.065
Do not fear have I not commanded you?

213
00:12:16.065 --> 00:12:17.505
Be courageous, be valiant.

214
00:12:18.725 --> 00:12:21.105
And so the servants of Absalom did to Amon

215
00:12:21.105 --> 00:12:24.665
as Absalom had commanded, then all the king's sons arose

216
00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:26.065
and each mounted his mule and fled.

217
00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:32.565
So see what just happened after two full years

218
00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:38.765
where Absalom was nursing his hatred like Gollum

219
00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:41.645
with the ring, he's, he's just nursing this hatred.

220
00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:44.325
And then he plays the gracious host.

221
00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:48.725
Yet the whole time he's plotting his revenge against Amon.

222
00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:55.385
And notice, just like David did with Uriah,

223
00:12:56.215 --> 00:12:58.145
Absalom had his servants do the dirty work.

224
00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:03.615
I don't wanna touch him, but you guys go kill

225
00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:07.305
him again.

226
00:13:08.025 --> 00:13:10.265
Nathan's prophecy to David was coming true.

227
00:13:12.385 --> 00:13:14.185
Remember Nathan said the sword will not

228
00:13:14.185 --> 00:13:15.465
depart from your house.

229
00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:20.915
What's happening? Death, destruction,

230
00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:22.995
it's all over the place.

231
00:13:26.135 --> 00:13:27.945
It's sibling rivalry to the extreme.

232
00:13:30.815 --> 00:13:32.315
And so this has happened, and now the rest

233
00:13:32.315 --> 00:13:33.995
of David's family returns to Jerusalem

234
00:13:33.995 --> 00:13:36.155
and they're grieving together because of what just happened.

235
00:13:36.155 --> 00:13:40.035
But Absalom instead, he flees to his grandpa's house

236
00:13:40.335 --> 00:13:41.835
that's in a different part of the region

237
00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:43.995
and he ends up staying there for three years.

238
00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:50.975
He might've thought as he was taking Amons life,

239
00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:53.215
he he might've thought, man, I'm gonna honor Tamar

240
00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:55.135
because of what he did to her.

241
00:13:55.275 --> 00:13:57.735
But what he did is instead just multiplies her grief

242
00:13:57.735 --> 00:14:00.735
because now in a sense she's lost another brother, the one

243
00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:03.015
who was protecting her, providing for her, he's gone.

244
00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:05.015
And so she's alone

245
00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:12.465
then think about am Absalom's life.

246
00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:15.025
He's in exile from his homeland.

247
00:14:15.095 --> 00:14:16.825
He's living this different style

248
00:14:16.845 --> 00:14:18.545
of life than he was in Jerusalem.

249
00:14:18.685 --> 00:14:22.065
And he, you can think how empty he must feel as he's fleeing

250
00:14:22.205 --> 00:14:24.825
and really a, a fear of his life really.

251
00:14:31.435 --> 00:14:36.325
So that takes us to chapter 14, Where

252
00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:37.445
as we move into this chapter,

253
00:14:37.445 --> 00:14:40.165
you might remember Joab Joab was, uh, the leader

254
00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:41.405
of David's army.

255
00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:43.045
He was very loyal to David.

256
00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:47.565
And what we find in chapter 14 is actually similar to

257
00:14:47.565 --> 00:14:49.365
what Nathan did with David in chapter 12.

258
00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:54.045
What Joab does is he brings this woman before David

259
00:14:54.225 --> 00:14:58.845
and he is telling her a story to tell to David, to try

260
00:14:58.845 --> 00:15:00.125
to get David to do something

261
00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:02.565
that Joab thinks David would want to do.

262
00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:06.445
He would assume David wants to reconcile

263
00:15:06.445 --> 00:15:07.765
with Absalom, his son.

264
00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.765
And so Joab iss like, I'm gonna work this situation

265
00:15:10.825 --> 00:15:14.285
to make sure that David brings Absalom home.

266
00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:17.805
And this woman tells the story to David.

267
00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:21.565
But David has been duped before by a story.

268
00:15:21.585 --> 00:15:24.645
And so he sees through it this time, but it still works.

269
00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:28.645
It still works to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.

270
00:15:29.985 --> 00:15:31.805
Here's what Joab didn't understand, though.

271
00:15:34.695 --> 00:15:37.035
He didn't know that David is not like the,

272
00:15:37.495 --> 00:15:40.795
the father in the Luke 15 prodigal son parable.

273
00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:44.475
The son comes home, the the father runs to him

274
00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:46.555
and embraces him and welcomes him back in.

275
00:15:47.345 --> 00:15:51.475
Joab thought that's how David's gonna be. David is not that

276
00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:52.475
Way.

277
00:15:54.055 --> 00:15:56.675
He did not run out to greet Absalom when he returned.

278
00:15:56.775 --> 00:16:01.675
In fact, he refused to meet with Absalom, his own son.

279
00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:07.315
Joab set the table like this is gonna happen.

280
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:09.395
Reconciliation between father and son.

281
00:16:09.395 --> 00:16:11.395
That's how it's gonna work, right? This is great.

282
00:16:12.095 --> 00:16:16.425
And David doesn't, now

283
00:16:16.485 --> 00:16:17.505
the the narrator.

284
00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:20.465
So, so this is, this is written

285
00:16:20.525 --> 00:16:22.025
by someone looking back at the story.

286
00:16:22.025 --> 00:16:23.345
They're hearing all the accounts

287
00:16:23.345 --> 00:16:24.625
and they're, they're writing it down.

288
00:16:25.205 --> 00:16:28.545
The narrator inserts something really interesting here in

289
00:16:28.545 --> 00:16:29.785
the middle of this narrative.

290
00:16:32.205 --> 00:16:34.385
He describes Absalom in certain

291
00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:37.225
ways, could just tell the story.

292
00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:38.665
He came back to Jerusalem, here's what happened.

293
00:16:38.685 --> 00:16:40.545
But, but then there's this insertion of

294
00:16:40.925 --> 00:16:42.745
of a picture of Absalom.

295
00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:43.785
And I want you to see this.

296
00:16:43.785 --> 00:16:47.865
Look at verses 25 and 26 of chapter 14.

297
00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:53.745
And this is really important

298
00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:57.875
because there's some foreshadowing here about

299
00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:59.395
what will happen over the next few weeks.

300
00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:05.315
Two Samuel 14 verses 25 and 26.

301
00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:10.475
See this Now in all Israel, there was no one so much

302
00:17:10.535 --> 00:17:13.875
to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom

303
00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.995
from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

304
00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.475
There was no blemish in him.

305
00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:22.075
And when he cut the hair of his head for at the end

306
00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:23.475
of every year, he used to cut it.

307
00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:24.955
When it was heavy on him, he would cut it.

308
00:17:25.495 --> 00:17:28.515
He weighed the hair of his head, 200 shekels

309
00:17:28.575 --> 00:17:29.635
by the king's weight.

310
00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:33.035
That's five pounds of hair

311
00:17:34.425 --> 00:17:37.115
Like Pantene commercial to the max right here, right?

312
00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:45.475
But why does this inserted into the story seems irrelevant.

313
00:17:46.175 --> 00:17:47.475
That's what he looked like. His hair

314
00:17:47.475 --> 00:17:48.595
was beautiful, all these things.

315
00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:52.165
It will show up again over the next few chapters.

316
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.645
And it's a bit of foreshadowing

317
00:17:54.645 --> 00:17:56.765
because doesn't it sound, just think about this,

318
00:17:56.995 --> 00:18:01.085
doesn't it sound a whole lot like the way Saul was

319
00:18:01.115 --> 00:18:02.845
described back in First Samuel?

320
00:18:04.705 --> 00:18:06.905
Remember Saul was a head taller than everybody else.

321
00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:08.825
He looks the part, he's handsome.

322
00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:10.625
He's, he's surely the king, right?

323
00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:13.025
That guy, he looks like he's gonna be the king.

324
00:18:13.295 --> 00:18:15.505
Certainly he is the king

325
00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:19.005
and he was the king for a while.

326
00:18:19.105 --> 00:18:23.905
But what we learned about Saul is

327
00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:27.525
what we'll learn about Absalom here we came to discover

328
00:18:27.525 --> 00:18:28.925
that Saul's heart was not right.

329
00:18:29.705 --> 00:18:32.405
His, his posture and his body looked the part,

330
00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:33.725
but his heart was wrong.

331
00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:38.485
Absalom looks the part, but his heart was wrong as well.

332
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.325
Watch what happens. Verse 28.

333
00:18:43.815 --> 00:18:47.355
So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem without coming

334
00:18:47.355 --> 00:18:48.515
into the King's presence.

335
00:18:51.165 --> 00:18:53.895
Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king,

336
00:18:54.035 --> 00:18:55.415
but Joab would not come to him.

337
00:18:56.475 --> 00:18:58.655
And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come.

338
00:19:00.555 --> 00:19:01.925
Then he said to his servants,

339
00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:03.605
see Jo Abs field is next to mine.

340
00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:06.325
He has barley there. Go and set it on fire.

341
00:19:08.265 --> 00:19:10.365
So Absalom servants set the field on fire.

342
00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:13.675
Then Jo AB arose, went to Absalom at his house

343
00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:15.035
and said to him, why have your servants

344
00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:16.075
set my field on fire?

345
00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:19.995
Absalom answered, Joab, behold, I sent word to you,

346
00:19:19.995 --> 00:19:21.275
come here that I may send you to the king

347
00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:23.195
to ask why have I come from Yeshua?

348
00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:26.475
It'd be better for me to be there still now,

349
00:19:26.475 --> 00:19:28.395
therefore, let me go into the presence of the king

350
00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:30.395
and if there's guilt in me, let him put me to death.

351
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.375
And then Joab went to the king, told him,

352
00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:35.615
and he summoned Absalom, and he came to the king

353
00:19:35.615 --> 00:19:38.215
and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king

354
00:19:38.755 --> 00:19:40.295
and the king kissed Absalom.

355
00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:46.215
Now that got ugly real quick, didn't it?

356
00:19:47.495 --> 00:19:50.095
I can realize why Absalom was frustrated,

357
00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:53.835
but to the point where you start burning people's fields

358
00:19:53.835 --> 00:19:54.955
because of it like that,

359
00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:58.515
that just indicates something's wrong in his own heart,

360
00:20:01.455 --> 00:20:03.845
which is all evidence of God's judgment

361
00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:08.835
on this family for what David had done.

362
00:20:11.715 --> 00:20:13.975
But I want you to notice what happened here at the end,

363
00:20:13.995 --> 00:20:15.415
how the narrative ended.

364
00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:19.775
Absalom finally sees David two years

365
00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:25.215
after his return to Jerusalem, which was three years

366
00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:26.815
after Amman's murder.

367
00:20:28.075 --> 00:20:30.535
So for five whole years, David

368
00:20:30.635 --> 00:20:32.735
and Abson never even saw each other once,

369
00:20:37.305 --> 00:20:38.565
and we don't even know yet.

370
00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:41.525
'cause the way it reads at the end is very vague.

371
00:20:41.525 --> 00:20:44.005
We don't even know yet if they're going to be reconciled

372
00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.105
because to this point, neither father

373
00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:51.185
nor son had repented of their actions.

374
00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:55.545
We don't see it in David, we don't see it in Absalom.

375
00:20:55.545 --> 00:20:56.985
They're just both kind of living

376
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.465
and now they're face to face

377
00:20:58.525 --> 00:21:00.145
and we don't know how it's going to go.

378
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:05.105
But think about that. They were both in

379
00:21:05.105 --> 00:21:06.185
Jerusalem for two whole years.

380
00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:08.025
They were living under the same sky,

381
00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:09.505
but they were worlds apart.

382
00:21:12.385 --> 00:21:14.295
There was proximity without presence.

383
00:21:14.825 --> 00:21:17.135
There was relationship without reconciliation.

384
00:21:18.845 --> 00:21:20.585
If you've ever lived in that state with someone,

385
00:21:20.805 --> 00:21:23.425
it is incredibly difficult, isn't it?

386
00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:27.915
It's sad if these are father's son

387
00:21:28.335 --> 00:21:29.515
and they live near each other,

388
00:21:29.735 --> 00:21:31.355
but they're not even gonna talk to each other.

389
00:21:34.225 --> 00:21:35.715
It's very sad end

390
00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:37.355
and we'll see it only get worse

391
00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:39.275
over the next couple chapters.

392
00:21:42.415 --> 00:21:45.915
But that's the plot. So that's chapter 13 and 14.

393
00:21:47.685 --> 00:21:49.815
What then are the lessons we need to learn from this?

394
00:21:51.065 --> 00:21:53.605
As tragic as this is,

395
00:21:55.765 --> 00:21:58.095
what do we learn from it about the characters,

396
00:21:58.095 --> 00:21:59.775
about ourselves, about humanity?

397
00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:05.195
What do we learn about God? What lessons should we learn?

398
00:22:05.215 --> 00:22:06.315
Here's three lessons.

399
00:22:07.815 --> 00:22:12.755
The first one, sin always over promises,

400
00:22:13.295 --> 00:22:14.355
but under delivers.

401
00:22:16.645 --> 00:22:21.515
As we look at these two chapters, sin always over promises

402
00:22:21.775 --> 00:22:23.275
and under delivers.

403
00:22:26.015 --> 00:22:28.345
Amon was obsessed with Tamar.

404
00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:34.545
That poisonous root of lust went unchecked in his life

405
00:22:34.885 --> 00:22:36.665
and it led to this kind of sinful

406
00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:41.105
and destructive behavior like father-like son, right?

407
00:22:44.765 --> 00:22:46.985
But I want you to notice something here at the beginning

408
00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:51.145
of chapter 13, Amon supposedly loved Tamar.

409
00:22:51.155 --> 00:22:52.745
Again, that was just lust,

410
00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:57.665
but that sin the temptation, it overpromised,

411
00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:02.585
but underdelivered, watch this.

412
00:23:04.045 --> 00:23:06.065
Here's how that sin overpromised and underdelivered.

413
00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:09.465
You can imagine the temptation coming into amman's heart

414
00:23:09.485 --> 00:23:11.825
as the enemy would toss things in his mind.

415
00:23:11.895 --> 00:23:13.625
He's like, Hey, hey, listen, Amon,

416
00:23:14.395 --> 00:23:15.705
God's holding out on you, man.

417
00:23:16.715 --> 00:23:18.445
There's no reason you can't have her.

418
00:23:18.745 --> 00:23:21.565
Why is God holding out on you? Look at how beautiful she is.

419
00:23:21.865 --> 00:23:24.405
Surely you'll be fulfilled once you have her.

420
00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:28.965
You should go take her It over.

421
00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:30.605
Promise it promised a lot,

422
00:23:32.545 --> 00:23:34.645
but watch how it under delivered.

423
00:23:34.645 --> 00:23:37.125
Look back at chapter 13, verse 15.

424
00:23:44.765 --> 00:23:47.065
Then like this is immediately

425
00:23:47.075 --> 00:23:51.835
after he had done what he had done to her immediately.

426
00:23:52.425 --> 00:23:55.755
Then Amon hated her with very great hatred.

427
00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:59.475
So that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than

428
00:23:59.475 --> 00:24:01.515
the love with which he had loved her.

429
00:24:01.615 --> 00:24:03.875
And Amon said to her, get up. Go.

430
00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:10.535
Like immediately, his mindset toward her flipped

431
00:24:10.765 --> 00:24:12.335
what he thought he was gonna get out of it.

432
00:24:12.355 --> 00:24:14.455
He actually got the exact opposite from it.

433
00:24:18.335 --> 00:24:20.955
Why? Because it wasn't love to begin with.

434
00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:26.625
Listen, if it's lust, if you're driven by lust,

435
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:28.665
it's gonna be take, take, take.

436
00:24:28.685 --> 00:24:30.745
And then if something doesn't give you what you want,

437
00:24:31.055 --> 00:24:32.305
it's not going to fulfill you.

438
00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:35.185
It's gonna actually flip on you. Lust is take, take.

439
00:24:35.245 --> 00:24:38.465
But if it's love, if you're driven by love, it's give,

440
00:24:39.135 --> 00:24:40.385
give, give.

441
00:24:45.145 --> 00:24:46.525
The supposed pleasure

442
00:24:46.915 --> 00:24:50.285
that he sought lasted mere moments.

443
00:24:50.705 --> 00:24:54.125
But the destruction and devastation lasted a lifetime.

444
00:24:58.075 --> 00:25:01.655
Sin always over promises and under delivers.

445
00:25:04.765 --> 00:25:08.315
How have you seen that in your life, right?

446
00:25:08.315 --> 00:25:10.355
Have you seen this, this false promise

447
00:25:10.455 --> 00:25:14.365
of fulfillment show up where this,

448
00:25:14.835 --> 00:25:18.485
this thing you thought would bring you joy that you crave,

449
00:25:18.665 --> 00:25:20.725
but it ended up actually making your life worse.

450
00:25:25.225 --> 00:25:27.075
Like that time you thought winning

451
00:25:27.075 --> 00:25:28.995
that argument would validate you,

452
00:25:31.255 --> 00:25:33.395
but now you just kind of feel hollow

453
00:25:33.895 --> 00:25:38.275
and there's this atmosphere of of bitterness

454
00:25:38.295 --> 00:25:40.115
around you from other people too.

455
00:25:45.135 --> 00:25:47.035
Or you materialistically thought that

456
00:25:47.035 --> 00:25:49.515
that nicer car would bring you the self-confidence

457
00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:50.515
that you want,

458
00:25:52.355 --> 00:25:54.775
but that same insecurity creeps in

459
00:25:54.835 --> 00:25:57.055
as the new car smell fades.

460
00:26:01.305 --> 00:26:05.565
Or you thought that that one more drink or one more scroll

461
00:26:05.705 --> 00:26:09.125
or one more episode, will finally relax you

462
00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:12.785
until you overdo it

463
00:26:12.785 --> 00:26:15.465
and then you end up being more depleted than

464
00:26:15.465 --> 00:26:20.465
before and on and on, right?

465
00:26:20.605 --> 00:26:23.645
There's all kinds of things. But all of those, all

466
00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:27.725
of those start with sin promising something.

467
00:26:29.695 --> 00:26:31.355
You wouldn't do it if it wasn't like, Hey,

468
00:26:31.355 --> 00:26:32.795
there's something on the other side of this, right?

469
00:26:33.655 --> 00:26:37.115
Sin promises something, whether it's fulfillment or joy

470
00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:38.435
or peace or pleasure

471
00:26:38.495 --> 00:26:41.355
or whatever, like it promises something.

472
00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:45.045
Yet the moment you let those seeds begin to grow,

473
00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:47.525
it always under delivers.

474
00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:52.415
It promises and then it under delivers.

475
00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:54.175
And so what do we, what should we do with this?

476
00:26:54.355 --> 00:26:56.415
We should cut sin off at the root.

477
00:26:57.235 --> 00:26:59.455
We shouldn't even let the desires fester.

478
00:26:59.455 --> 00:27:01.775
This promise start to creep in.

479
00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:03.975
Like maybe I'm, maybe, God, you are holding out on me.

480
00:27:04.045 --> 00:27:06.375
That sounds like Genesis in the garden, right?

481
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:09.015
Genesis three, God's holding out on you.

482
00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:11.135
God's got more for you. He's not telling you about,

483
00:27:11.395 --> 00:27:15.015
that's the desire of our sinful flesh, festering.

484
00:27:15.995 --> 00:27:17.975
We should cut that off at the root

485
00:27:17.975 --> 00:27:19.095
because here's what the enemy will do.

486
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:23.055
He will tell you lie to you.

487
00:27:26.465 --> 00:27:29.325
It won't get that bad. You, you.

488
00:27:29.545 --> 00:27:32.175
You can control it like you can.

489
00:27:32.195 --> 00:27:34.055
You can dabble in this just a little bit.

490
00:27:34.115 --> 00:27:35.375
You can do this just a little bit,

491
00:27:35.515 --> 00:27:37.175
but you'll be able to keep it under control.

492
00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:38.655
You'll be able to keep it managed.

493
00:27:38.715 --> 00:27:39.615
You don't have to worry about,

494
00:27:39.615 --> 00:27:41.095
it's not gonna get outta control.

495
00:27:41.325 --> 00:27:43.815
He's lying to you. He's overpromising something.

496
00:27:43.955 --> 00:27:46.015
And the under delivery of that is

497
00:27:46.015 --> 00:27:47.335
that it gets way outta control.

498
00:27:47.675 --> 00:27:48.895
Far worse than you could ever imagine.

499
00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:53.775
You never would've thought at the beginning this one little

500
00:27:53.775 --> 00:27:54.975
step would lead to that.

501
00:27:57.935 --> 00:28:00.435
That's why like John Owen said hundreds of years ago,

502
00:28:00.535 --> 00:28:04.315
you must be killing sin or it will be killing you.

503
00:28:09.575 --> 00:28:12.595
Sin always over promises and under delivers.

504
00:28:14.725 --> 00:28:17.425
So flee from it instead of pursue it.

505
00:28:20.055 --> 00:28:21.075
Here's the second lesson.

506
00:28:22.505 --> 00:28:24.835
It's very specific example of what I just talked about.

507
00:28:25.345 --> 00:28:27.715
Revenge promises justice,

508
00:28:28.455 --> 00:28:30.515
but delivers emptiness.

509
00:28:33.365 --> 00:28:38.195
Revenge promises justice, but it delivers emptiness.

510
00:28:42.305 --> 00:28:46.605
Did Amon deserve to die for what he did to Tamar? Yes.

511
00:28:49.395 --> 00:28:52.255
But was Absalom the one who was supposed to take

512
00:28:52.485 --> 00:28:57.235
that justice only if

513
00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:59.075
God clearly told him to do it?

514
00:29:01.145 --> 00:29:02.645
And we don't see that anywhere.

515
00:29:03.505 --> 00:29:07.335
We Don't see God approve of what Absalom did here.

516
00:29:07.365 --> 00:29:10.455
Instead, what we discover is a two year scheme

517
00:29:10.595 --> 00:29:11.815
to take Amons life.

518
00:29:15.785 --> 00:29:19.525
Now, God did bring justice on Amon through this.

519
00:29:19.665 --> 00:29:22.925
Sinful means. God still brought about justice for Amon,

520
00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:24.685
but Absalom was not innocent.

521
00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:28.325
His guilt started in the long game of bitterness

522
00:29:28.325 --> 00:29:32.635
that he played in the

523
00:29:32.635 --> 00:29:33.755
garden of his heart.

524
00:29:34.855 --> 00:29:38.075
He was actively cultivating amman's destruction.

525
00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:43.645
And look at what it brought Absalom.

526
00:29:43.705 --> 00:29:45.445
It brought this emptiness.

527
00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:51.705
It brought estrangement from his family for five years

528
00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:55.965
when it could have been handled completely differently.

529
00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:01.385
You may have heard the phrase,

530
00:30:02.415 --> 00:30:04.665
revenge is a dish best served

531
00:30:04.855 --> 00:30:09.265
cold for the Christian.

532
00:30:10.165 --> 00:30:12.065
You ought to send that dish right back to the kitchen.

533
00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.785
Remember what Romans 1219 said?

534
00:30:16.895 --> 00:30:20.545
Vengeance is mind says the Lord. That means it's not ours.

535
00:30:21.515 --> 00:30:22.745
We're gonna do it wrongly.

536
00:30:22.915 --> 00:30:24.265
We're gonna go after something

537
00:30:24.265 --> 00:30:25.425
and we're gonna say, this is justice.

538
00:30:25.455 --> 00:30:27.385
This is the right thing and we're gonna mess it up.

539
00:30:27.445 --> 00:30:30.545
But God never will. God will always bring perfect justice,

540
00:30:30.575 --> 00:30:32.905
perfect vengeance in his time, in his way.

541
00:30:33.045 --> 00:30:36.215
We don't see the whole picture. We don't know what's best.

542
00:30:36.395 --> 00:30:38.295
How is this actually gonna bring the most glory to God?

543
00:30:38.345 --> 00:30:40.255
How's this actually gonna be good for everyone else?

544
00:30:40.515 --> 00:30:44.375
And we just go for it and we cause more destruction.

545
00:30:46.205 --> 00:30:49.855
That's why Jesus said, love your enemies,

546
00:30:52.605 --> 00:30:54.695
because it's God's job, not ours,

547
00:30:55.035 --> 00:30:57.375
to bring justice in the end.

548
00:30:58.705 --> 00:30:59.955
That means there's mechanisms,

549
00:30:59.965 --> 00:31:01.355
God's set up, governments, that kind of stuff.

550
00:31:01.455 --> 00:31:05.915
Yes. But for us personally, our job is not to take

551
00:31:06.585 --> 00:31:10.125
vengeance because it only leads to emptiness.

552
00:31:10.125 --> 00:31:12.485
It only leads to things

553
00:31:12.635 --> 00:31:15.125
that cause more pain and sorrow.

554
00:31:15.145 --> 00:31:18.805
So let him bring about the judgment on sin that he desires.

555
00:31:22.865 --> 00:31:25.405
All of this leads us to the third lesson we ought

556
00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:28.555
to get from this passage and

557
00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:31.435
to see this one we've gotta put on our hermeneutical lenses

558
00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:34.515
of Christological focus.

559
00:31:36.535 --> 00:31:38.275
See, hermeneutics is just the study of

560
00:31:38.275 --> 00:31:40.275
how we understand God's word, how we interpret the,

561
00:31:40.415 --> 00:31:43.275
the passages of scripture and how they all work together.

562
00:31:44.495 --> 00:31:46.315
We have to put on those specific lenses

563
00:31:46.455 --> 00:31:50.315
to look back into the Old Testament, to see Jesus there.

564
00:31:51.695 --> 00:31:52.915
So Luke 24 shows us.

565
00:31:52.915 --> 00:31:55.195
Jesus showed us that we can see Him everywhere.

566
00:31:55.335 --> 00:31:56.475
How do we see Jesus here?

567
00:31:56.495 --> 00:31:58.715
How do we see with the lenses of Christ

568
00:31:59.105 --> 00:32:02.275
that he is the promised king?

569
00:32:04.095 --> 00:32:08.865
Well, here's the third lesson where David's sons failed.

570
00:32:09.935 --> 00:32:12.105
David's son succeeded.

571
00:32:14.485 --> 00:32:16.075
Where David's sons failed.

572
00:32:17.285 --> 00:32:19.975
David's son succeeded.

573
00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:22.975
Notice the capital S that's talking

574
00:32:23.075 --> 00:32:25.895
to the title, the Son of David.

575
00:32:26.775 --> 00:32:31.575
'cause remember back in chapter seven, God told David, one

576
00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:35.015
of your sons will sit on the throne forever.

577
00:32:36.635 --> 00:32:40.085
So we got a couple options here, couple sons.

578
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:43.245
Let's see how they showed up here.

579
00:32:43.345 --> 00:32:45.285
So I'll show you how we see Jesus through all this.

580
00:32:45.285 --> 00:32:47.245
The true promise king who fulfilled all of this.

581
00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:49.605
Let me show you how Jesus is the son

582
00:32:49.795 --> 00:32:50.885
that they were talking about.

583
00:32:50.985 --> 00:32:55.015
Not these guys. Think about Amon.

584
00:32:57.525 --> 00:33:02.015
Amon nurtured lust and selfishness in his heart.

585
00:33:03.505 --> 00:33:05.295
Jesus starved it.

586
00:33:08.595 --> 00:33:10.485
I've said this before, Hebrews four 15,

587
00:33:12.085 --> 00:33:14.745
For we do not have a high priest who's unable to sympathize

588
00:33:14.745 --> 00:33:16.305
with our weaknesses, but one

589
00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:19.985
who in every respect has been tempted as we are

590
00:33:20.685 --> 00:33:22.585
yet without sin.

591
00:33:24.515 --> 00:33:27.025
David failed at that. Amon failed at that.

592
00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:31.145
But Jesus in the wilderness faced the core temptations every

593
00:33:31.205 --> 00:33:33.065
one of us will ever face.

594
00:33:33.285 --> 00:33:36.345
And he overcame it, not by his own willpower, but

595
00:33:36.345 --> 00:33:38.425
because he trusted the spirit of God

596
00:33:38.525 --> 00:33:41.065
and the word of God to defeat the enemy.

597
00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:43.905
And he never gave in his entire life,

598
00:33:44.235 --> 00:33:48.385
never sinned once He is the promised

599
00:33:48.965 --> 00:33:49.985
son of David.

600
00:33:52.965 --> 00:33:55.905
Think of Absalom another option.

601
00:33:58.245 --> 00:33:59.815
Absalom calculated murder.

602
00:34:02.315 --> 00:34:03.865
Jesus calculated mercy.

603
00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:09.115
Instead of executing revenge, Jesus

604
00:34:09.995 --> 00:34:11.875
absorbed it on the cross.

605
00:34:12.985 --> 00:34:16.075
Instead of calling down hundreds of angels

606
00:34:16.215 --> 00:34:18.715
to execute his tormentors

607
00:34:18.935 --> 00:34:22.755
and to destroy them, Jesus took the justice

608
00:34:22.905 --> 00:34:23.995
that we deserve

609
00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:26.955
and gave us the forgiveness that we could never earn.

610
00:34:28.495 --> 00:34:29.515
He didn't take revenge.

611
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:32.595
He absorbed it so that you and I could be free.

612
00:34:36.505 --> 00:34:39.115
He's the promised son of David.

613
00:34:42.665 --> 00:34:47.605
David himself failed unreconciled relationship with Absalom,

614
00:34:47.715 --> 00:34:49.205
poor fathering all over the place,

615
00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:52.805
but they were separated for two years in the same vicinity

616
00:34:52.825 --> 00:34:55.325
for five years total instead of allowing us

617
00:34:55.325 --> 00:34:57.605
to remain separated from God.

618
00:34:57.635 --> 00:35:00.965
Ephesians two 16, Jesus reconciles us

619
00:35:01.105 --> 00:35:05.645
to God in one body through the cross, killing the hostility.

620
00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:09.725
He became our peace destroying the wall of hostility

621
00:35:09.725 --> 00:35:10.925
between us and God.

622
00:35:11.065 --> 00:35:12.885
He said, I'm not gonna leave you separated.

623
00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:14.405
I'm bringing you to myself.

624
00:35:16.085 --> 00:35:18.335
He's the promised son of David

625
00:35:23.725 --> 00:35:25.075
where David's sons failed.

626
00:35:25.695 --> 00:35:30.355
The son of David succeeded and he is our hope.

627
00:35:33.445 --> 00:35:35.585
And so church, these chapters we've studied today

628
00:35:37.225 --> 00:35:39.925
are both a mirror and a warning.

629
00:35:42.305 --> 00:35:46.835
Will we be like Amon feeding our lusts until they devour us?

630
00:35:48.865 --> 00:35:51.875
Will we be like Absalom nursing our

631
00:35:51.935 --> 00:35:53.315
wounds until they poison us?

632
00:35:55.505 --> 00:35:59.755
Will we be like David not reconciling with those around us?

633
00:36:02.675 --> 00:36:04.015
Or will we be

634
00:36:05.395 --> 00:36:08.615
living out this rest in God's power

635
00:36:08.755 --> 00:36:12.415
to kill sin at the root, to love our enemies, to pray

636
00:36:12.415 --> 00:36:13.455
for those who persecute us

637
00:36:13.595 --> 00:36:15.335
and to pursue reconciliation with others?

638
00:36:15.425 --> 00:36:20.175
Which one are we gonna be? Which one are we gonna pursue?

639
00:36:21.905 --> 00:36:24.165
That's the mirror we have here.

640
00:36:24.505 --> 00:36:27.645
And the warning is that if we walk that path, it's going

641
00:36:27.645 --> 00:36:30.205
to destroy and damage and harm.

642
00:36:34.005 --> 00:36:35.705
See, here's the thing. The gospel is not just

643
00:36:35.705 --> 00:36:36.945
that our sins are forgiven, given

644
00:36:38.885 --> 00:36:42.385
the gospel includes the fact that we are wholeheartedly

645
00:36:42.895 --> 00:36:45.585
transformed by the very spirit of God.

646
00:36:49.585 --> 00:36:53.435
Something that happens as we look to Jesus, the author

647
00:36:53.435 --> 00:36:55.915
and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set

648
00:36:55.915 --> 00:37:00.395
before him despised the shame of the cross

649
00:37:00.735 --> 00:37:02.355
and took it upon himself.

650
00:37:02.535 --> 00:37:04.875
Why? So that we might be free.

651
00:37:07.175 --> 00:37:08.835
That's the heart cry.

652
00:37:08.975 --> 00:37:13.075
The the growing love for him is because we see him in that.

653
00:37:13.175 --> 00:37:15.835
We see him right here in chapter 13 and 14.

654
00:37:20.185 --> 00:37:24.245
How will we respond? Well, that's the question I want us

655
00:37:24.245 --> 00:37:26.525
to ask right now as you bow your heads with me,

656
00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:30.525
just to focus a little bit here.

657
00:37:30.745 --> 00:37:34.045
And I wanna ask you to do what that just said to do.

658
00:37:34.995 --> 00:37:37.285
Take this as a mirror. Take this as a warning.

659
00:37:41.055 --> 00:37:43.505
Will we be like these in the passages?

660
00:37:47.725 --> 00:37:49.985
And maybe even ask yourself, how have you been like that?

661
00:37:50.085 --> 00:37:50.625
How have you

662
00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:58.165
he believed the over promises that sin offers?

663
00:38:04.465 --> 00:38:07.495
Where are you right now pursuing something that is

664
00:38:07.525 --> 00:38:10.095
outside the bounds of God's commands?

665
00:38:11.195 --> 00:38:15.895
It will not satisfy you. His commands are not to burden you.

666
00:38:15.895 --> 00:38:19.935
These commands are to give you life in Christ

667
00:38:22.305 --> 00:38:24.675
that life is designed this way.

668
00:38:25.225 --> 00:38:27.635
When you live that way, it works better.

669
00:38:31.855 --> 00:38:35.885
But in that run to his power, you can't do that yourself.

670
00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:43.405
So where are you running away? Down a path that's not godly.

671
00:38:45.675 --> 00:38:47.855
Run back to him, turn back to him. Repent.

672
00:38:50.425 --> 00:38:52.975
Maybe it's revenge, maybe it's lust. Maybe it's greed.

673
00:38:52.975 --> 00:38:54.055
Maybe it's pride.

674
00:38:59.535 --> 00:39:00.915
And maybe you've been hurt,

675
00:39:01.495 --> 00:39:03.435
harmed in some way by someone else.

676
00:39:03.895 --> 00:39:08.355
You. You also carry that to the cross run to Jesus in that

677
00:39:09.455 --> 00:39:12.435
to say, Jesus, you are the justice seeker.

678
00:39:12.495 --> 00:39:14.195
You are the the judge of all.

679
00:39:14.215 --> 00:39:16.635
You are the one who's gonna make this right in your time

680
00:39:16.635 --> 00:39:19.155
and your way, and leave it there, rest in him,

681
00:39:25.095 --> 00:39:26.435
but look to him as the promised

682
00:39:26.465 --> 00:39:28.435
king maybe for the first time.

683
00:39:28.645 --> 00:39:29.835
Maybe you're not ever,

684
00:39:30.565 --> 00:39:31.955
maybe you've been in church your whole life

685
00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:33.475
and you've never seen Jesus as this kind

686
00:39:33.475 --> 00:39:36.955
of king, run to him.

687
00:39:38.105 --> 00:39:42.645
Own your sin. Say you need a savior. Jesus, I trust you.

688
00:39:44.505 --> 00:39:49.125
He will transform your life. Lord, help us.

689
00:39:49.705 --> 00:39:51.405
We need you every hour.

690
00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:56.235
We need you and things like

691
00:39:56.235 --> 00:39:57.595
this in your word.

692
00:39:57.935 --> 00:40:01.635
Remind us that we need you left to our own.

693
00:40:02.295 --> 00:40:06.235
We will destroy ourselves and others. God, we need you.

694
00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:11.555
Help us now. In Jesus' name. Amen.

695
00:40:12.485 --> 00:40:14.195
Let's stand together and let's respond and worship.
