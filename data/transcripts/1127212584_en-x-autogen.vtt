00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:09.565
Well, church, uh, we, we had, uh,

2
00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:11.165
two baptisms in the first service

3
00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:13.765
and now we have three in this service,

4
00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:15.325
and so we're super thankful for that.

5
00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:17.885
You just might look around and see all the students in the

6
00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.205
back there coming

7
00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.725
to celebrate Landry Smith who's being baptized today.

8
00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:26.085
God's been working on her heart for a while and camp

9
00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:27.685
and school and church stuff,

10
00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:30.045
and especially at home, just thankful for

11
00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.405
what God has done is she shared that

12
00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:32.765
with our student ministry team

13
00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.205
and talked with us about her faith in Christ.

14
00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:38.205
And so because of that profession of faith land, I get

15
00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.485
to baptize you in the name of the Father, son,

16
00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:41.285
and Holy Spirit,

17
00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:46.485
praise God.
