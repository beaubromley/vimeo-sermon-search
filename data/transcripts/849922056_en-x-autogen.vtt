1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.270
Amen. Well, that was our kids camp this week.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.150
If you would celebrate what God did with us, he changed lives,

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.870
he affected hearts and uh, really did a big work.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.830
Thank you for praying for that.

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.790
If you'd celebrate with me about what God's done, please, he is good to us.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.030
It's great to be together this morning.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.270
I did hear a rumor that there's no coffee out there. I don't drink it at all,

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.870
but uh, let me just warn you, we're still gonna be okay, right?

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.150
It's gonna be okay. We're gonna worship, we're still gonna see God move.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.630
It's okay. Uh, we'll be surviving that. My name's John.

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.310
I'm one of the pastors here. Uh, it's great to be together.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750
I'm grateful for the opportunity to open God's word with you.

13
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.910
I was blessed to spend my first two weeks post sabbatical, uh,

14
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.190
at our student camp the week before and then, uh,

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.710
leading fourth grade boys this week at Kids camp. And it was a sweet time. Uh,

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.510
you just saw it, it was awesome. Uh,

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.230
I encourage you to go next year if you haven't been as a leader, uh,

18
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.110
send your kids as well. It's powerful.

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.630
But all that makes it a bit ironic that I'm preaching about rest this morning,

20
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.390
uh, because I felt a few times like buddy the elf, when he is asked,

21
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.590
how'd you sleep? He's like, great. I got a full 40 minutes. Right?

22
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950
So that's what I felt a couple times.

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.590
It's actually part of my main point today though, when you think about rest,

24
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.670
here's the reality I've learned recently. It,

25
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.310
it's possible to rest physically without resting spiritually.

26
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.790
It's possible to rest physically but not rest spiritually.

27
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.350
Like you can take two weeks off, you could take three months off.

28
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.710
You could take a year off, you could even retire.

29
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.420
But if your heart is not resting in the Lord,

30
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.310
if you are not finding your rest in Jesus,

31
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.790
you'll still be at that red line pace internally.

32
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.830
And whatever physical rest you get is really worthless in the end.

33
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.500
So here's the core truth today.

34
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.790
The truth is that true rest is spiritual first and physical second.

35
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.670
True rest is,

36
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.630
is spiritual first and physical second,

37
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.870
we must place a priority on internal rest,

38
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.310
on spiritual rest.

39
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.270
But understanding that is actually then how our physical rest begins to

40
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.620
actually work. And we'll see that today.

41
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.100
But as we get there,

42
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.060
first I wanna share a little bit about my experience with rest.

43
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.020
Recently as I went on my sabbatical and just been back two weeks,

44
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.780
getting us all on the same page of really what a sabbatical even is and then

45
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.140
really what rest is as I talk about what I faced

46
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.660
in that season.

47
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.640
And so the concept of the sabbatical actually goes back to the Old Testament

48
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.400
biblical practice of a Sabbath year for the farmland.

49
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.200
It's the idea of a year of release that's in the word itself.

50
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.760
Meaning every seven years they were to give the land that they farmed a year

51
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.960
off, work it for six and then take one year off.

52
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.080
And this was to let the soil replenish its nutrients to

53
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.200
replenish what it needed to come back even more fruitful for the next six

54
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.320
years of planting and harvesting. And they would see,

55
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.680
it's amazing to watch how it would work out that way that the six years would

56
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.720
produce more than they could in seven with the same land.

57
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.880
And so it's been used as a,

58
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.080
a way of treating academics and medical professionals and some things to

59
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.800
eliminate burnout. Over the years, we've applied that in the similar way.

60
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.080
And so we've done the same thing here. Uh, before we moved here in 2018.

61
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.600
The elders put in our policies a three month sabbatical every five years for

62
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.880
my position. And it means that, uh,

63
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.520
we want long-term ministry from our people on staff.

64
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.120
And so this helps ensure that. So it's not punitive, it's not mandated,

65
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.920
it's not anything that we have to do. It's meant to care for me. And,

66
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.320
and also now for our other staff members that we have implemented shorter

67
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.040
versions of it for the same timeframe.

68
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.800
I needed a break. That's what I, I faced after a long stretch of ministry,

69
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.440
even before coming here, needed a break.

70
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.240
And my family needed me to reinvest in them because they serve in a lot more

71
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.760
hidden way. Uh, they,

72
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.760
they share me with the church and so they serve that way so that

73
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.280
they needed some time with me as well.

74
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.760
And so about a year ago began thinking through what this would look like for me

75
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.960
to take my first sabbatical ever. And so I knew it was to prioritize my family.

76
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.720
That was key number one. But I wanted to ensure that it was a good,

77
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.520
healthy process for me to go away and,

78
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.280
and do some things that would really be helpful.

79
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.840
And so I talked to my counselor, I've been meeting with for a couple years,

80
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.880
talked to others who'd had sabbaticals as well. Like, what did you experience?

81
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.280
How did you face this? What was I gonna face when I go into it?

82
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.640
And so I was prepared for what I was gonna face emotionally and,

83
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.680
and spiritually.

84
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.320
I knew what was coming when I was gonna feel these sorts of things that,

85
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.000
that I wouldn't have this affirmation loop every Sunday.

86
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.200
I wouldn't have social media to where I could post something,

87
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.080
get a lot of likes from all that I knew I was gonna have to face that.

88
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.800
And I also knew that I wasn't gonna have to face the enemy attacking my

89
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.680
identity, that he was going to tell me that I was,

90
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.960
that I was worthless 'cause I'm not producing anything right now

91
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.720
that no one cared about me. He was gonna toss that stuff in my mind.

92
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.920
And so I knew that was coming and I pre-decided how to handle that.

93
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.560
But what I was not prepared for

94
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.210
was the physical side of what I was about to face.

95
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.260
See, I've been going hard for 13 straight years in ministry.

96
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.770
And there is a roller coaster of leadership challenges through that season of

97
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.210
time. C o v was in the middle of that.

98
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.830
I I counted back preaching, uh,

99
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.070
200 plus unique sermons.

100
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.650
Then you're thinking of,

101
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.650
of moves between states and transitions between churches,

102
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.450
vertigo a couple years ago.

103
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.200
And

104
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.080
You're adding all of that together.

105
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.160
Plus you add in this subtle achievement drive

106
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.440
that creeps into even churches where it's all about bigger

107
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.920
and better and more and growth and success in other people's eyes.

108
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.830
You add all that together.

109
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.590
And it turns out I was way more tired than I thought I was.

110
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.710
Like, if you would've asked me back in April, right before like Easter Sunday,

111
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.030
April, if you'd have asked me, I would've said, I feel fine. I feel great. I've,

112
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.150
I'm ready to go. I'm ready for the next season of life.

113
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.670
I don't need to take a sabbatical.

114
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.030
But April 16th, I preached on Sunday and I stepped away on Monday,

115
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.150
shut everything off.

116
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.190
And what that means also is that that faucet of adrenaline shut off.

117
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.640
And my brain kind of freaked out a little bit. Physically.

118
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.280
I felt like I was in a fog for about three or four weeks.

119
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.520
Like my brain wasn't, I couldn't remember people's names.

120
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.040
Like we had staff members come by the house on a scavenger hunt.

121
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.920
I was out mowing. I was like, I can't remember your name. Like, it was weird.

122
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.720
I didn't tell 'em that. But I didn't in the moment, couldn't,

123
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.480
couldn't think of it. I just couldn't conceive.

124
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.400
It was a physical reaction physically ill for about a week or two,

125
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.400
I was apathetic, just kind of generally.

126
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.440
This malaise was all over my body. So I didn't know what happened.

127
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.320
So I was like researching this. I'm like, what's going on?

128
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.280
Talking to my counselor, what is happening?

129
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.400
And I discovered that essentially my brain had been addicted to adrenaline.

130
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.290
You've heard the term adrenaline junkies.

131
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.770
It's literally an addiction that that adrenaline,

132
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.610
the dopamine hit comes and it causes you to need it and run

133
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.090
on it. Now let me, let me say this.

134
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.830
Adrenaline is a good thing created by God that when you get in a crisis

135
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.790
moment, you have some kind of almost supernatural, but,

136
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.750
but over the top physical abilities.

137
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.790
That's what you need to protect yourself at times when something happens, right?

138
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.980
But you were never meant to run on it all the time

139
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.920
to run at this red line pace, this high octane pace.

140
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.240
That's never what adrenaline was meant for.

141
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.640
And so what I was feeling for those first couple weeks was a physical

142
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.070
withdrawal from the drug of adrenaline.

143
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.600
Well, finally, thankfully, after that first month,

144
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.200
my brain cleared up. I was able to think normally things slowed down,

145
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.800
felt slower, my blood pressure lowered. I was able to sleep normally.

146
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.040
Like it all started to hit reset a little bit after three or four weeks.

147
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.540
And the rest of our time together, even those couple weeks were sweet.

148
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.460
But the rest of our time, those two months were incredibly sweet as a family.

149
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.020
Uh, we got to do a ton of things together. Memories made time at home together,

150
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.740
games, family camp, Levi's 10 trip.

151
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.740
We did all of that in this stretch of season of time. And, and so again,

152
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.540
like I said last week,

153
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.940
thank you for that time that you care for us so well towards that.

154
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.940
Our family is better off because of it. Now we're grateful.

155
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.630
But I share about that first month because what that month did is it set me back

156
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.790
spiritually. It,

157
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.110
it put me behind what I thought I was going to experience.

158
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.870
I had all these big plans, like for my sabbatical, getting away with Jesus,

159
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.070
spending days outside, just resting and praying. Like I had this,

160
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.830
this whole plan, this whole idea of wow, this would look,

161
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.630
but I really didn't wanna do much of anything. I mean,

162
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.350
the understanding of that struggle of just the day-to-day of like choosing to

163
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.630
walk into God's word and be with him. I just didn't really want to do it.

164
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.830
Like it felt like a wilderness season for me.

165
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.340
So that was hard. It set me behind. But here's how the Lord redeemed that again,

166
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.340
we know the Lord takes everything and turns it for good.

167
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.660
But this is so he did see for the first time in a long time,

168
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.740
I felt hungry and thirsty spiritually.

169
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.550
Here's one of the things that you, you may not understand.

170
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.230
If you've never worked on a church staff before in a Christian setting,

171
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.470
you might say, working at a church,

172
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.190
we're always kind of snacking on God's word. We're always around it.

173
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.990
Like we're, we're talking about it, we're studying for teachings. We're,

174
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.510
we're talking about it in Bible studies and we're having having meetings about

175
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.750
like we're, we're always kind of around it.

176
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.670
And so like you're having this bag of Cheetos at home all the time,

177
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.990
just kind of snacking all the time. You never get hungry.

178
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.570
But this was like I was fasting for a season.

179
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.250
Like I stepped away from that and I fasted.

180
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.730
And it reminded me that I need to take my hunger and thirst to Jesus

181
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.813
alone.

182
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.490
Not just to being around Christians and around the Bible enough and even

183
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.610
teaching it. But, but I'm hungry. I'm thirsty.

184
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.410
And so I need to take it to him.

185
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.690
Now I want you to think about all of this for a second. I mean, just,

186
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.610
just think about what I had the opportunity to do. This is, this is a blessing.

187
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.930
I know not everybody gets this so I don't take it for granted. But,

188
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.890
but think about this. I didn't have to work for three months and I got paid.

189
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.350
I was able to travel the world and see our,

190
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.750
our missionaries and see the pastors in Wales.

191
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.350
I was able to experience some really cool things that way.

192
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.590
I got to focus on my family in deep ways,

193
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.510
just be with them 24 7 for a couple months.

194
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.750
As sweet as those things are though,

195
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.530
as much as we're all sitting here like, yeah, I'd love to do that.

196
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.770
As as sweet as those things are though, if I'm not resting spiritually,

197
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.370
then they will not truly fill my cup.

198
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.780
Again, you can rest physically without resting spiritually,

199
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.120
but you can take three months off and you come back more exhausted

200
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.670
if you're not resting spiritually.

201
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.340
That's why the theme of my sabbatical ended up being this quote from

202
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.500
Augustine, a man who back in the fourth century,

203
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.940
he understood what it's like to pursue dopamine hits.

204
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.740
He tried all kinds of things kinda like Solomon did in the Old Testament.

205
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.740
He was trying all this stuff looking for the next high in his mind.

206
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.730
And his prayer ended up being this God,

207
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.130
you have made us for yourself and our heart is

208
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.650
restless until it finds its rest in you.

209
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.590
Like God, you've made us for yourself. You've made us to be with you.

210
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.590
And our heart is restless until it finds its rest in you

211
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.713
alone.

212
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.560
Was I searching for all the things like Solomon was like Augustine was? No,

213
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.360
but I was not finding my rest purely in Jesus.

214
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.880
So that's what I hope to show you today from Hebrews four,

215
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.440
the reality that Jesus is our true rest.

216
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.440
He's our spiritual rest that is infinitely better than any physical rest that we

217
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.273
can pursue.

218
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.040
And so I take your copy of God's word and turn to Hebrews four with me.

219
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.160
That's what I wanna do is start with reading this passage in Hebrews four

220
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.280
verses one through 13. It might be a bit confusing as we read it,

221
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.120
but ultimately it'll show us what true rest is and where we find it,

222
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.440
not just in taking some time off.

223
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.300
So Hebrews four verses one through 13.

224
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.530
Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands,

225
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.480
let us fear list any of you should seem to have failed to reach it

226
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.730
for good news came to us just as to them.

227
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.170
But the message they heard,

228
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.970
he's talking about Israel in the past did not benefit them because they were not

229
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.090
united by faith with those who listened

230
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.970
For we who have believed. Enter that rest. As God has said,

231
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.730
as I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest.

232
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.850
Although his works were finished from the foundation of the world,

233
00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.570
for he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way.

234
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.130
And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.

235
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.170
And again in this passage he said, they shall not enter my rest

236
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.610
since therefore it remains for some to enter it.

237
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.450
And those who formally received the good news failed to enter because of

238
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.410
disobedience. Again,

239
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:46.010
he appoints a certain day today saying through David so long afterward,

240
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.050
in the words already quoted today, if you hear his voice,

241
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.730
do not harden your hearts. He quoted that back in chapter three

242
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.570
for if Joshua had given them rest,

243
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.050
God would not have spoken of another day later on.

244
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.050
So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,

245
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.970
for whoever has entered God's rest,

246
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.250
has also rested from his works as God did from his.

247
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.850
Let us therefore strive to enter that rest so that no one may fall by.

248
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.610
The same sort of disobedience for the word of God is living inactive,

249
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.130
sharper than any two-edged sword,

250
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.610
piercing to the division of soul and of spirit of joints, of marrow,

251
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.650
discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

252
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.560
And no creatures hidden from its sight,

253
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.240
but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give

254
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.263
account.

255
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.760
So I started by sharing my experience with rest.

256
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.120
But now I wanna show you a couple other perspectives on rest that we can find

257
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.160
here in this passage.

258
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.040
First God's experience with rest.

259
00:16:55.210 --> 00:17:00.200
Let's look at God's experience. Now. We don't often think of God resting,

260
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.133
do we?

261
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.500
But

262
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.740
That's right here. We saw it in verses three and four.

263
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.780
And this is a reference back to Genesis two,

264
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:12.220
where God rested on the seventh day from all his works, his work of creation,

265
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.580
everything he created on the seventh day, he rested. But but what do we,

266
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.140
what do we think when we hear that it,

267
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.540
it seems like God rested from all his works,

268
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.900
that he kind of just wound the clock and then left it and stopped working

269
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.500
altogether. But that's not true, right?

270
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.780
Because we know God continues to work today. He's still at work.

271
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.220
And so that's not true.

272
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.740
It wasn't true that God was exhausted and had to quit working and he just did

273
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.620
too much in six days. No, what he was modeling here for us was a rhythm,

274
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.980
a template for us to follow six days of work and then a day of rest.

275
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.400
It's a template that we'll show see throughout God's word.

276
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.600
But then it also means if we see this about God,

277
00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.520
that there's more to it than just physical rest. 'cause God didn't need to.

278
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.640
So he's setting a template here. And then even here in Hebrews four,

279
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:10.720
he's talking about seeking rest in a way that's both today

280
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.800
and ongoing.

281
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.000
So it can't just be about physical rest here.

282
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.480
There's something else happening deeper,

283
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.840
which is why Hebrews four then uses Israel's experience on rest

284
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.080
to instruct us more on what true rest really is.

285
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.420
Saw God's experience.

286
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.700
Now we see Israel's experience as a helpful directive for us today.

287
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.720
Now, I read chapter four here,

288
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.640
part of it that actually extends up into chapter three in Hebrews,

289
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.480
where the author directly quote Psalm 95 and Psalm

290
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.640
95 is where God shares about the exodus where he delivered his people out of

291
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.440
Egypt and slavery. And the gist of all of it, all of chapter three,

292
00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.560
even here in chapter four,

293
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.600
is that those who were redeemed from slavery in Egypt,

294
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:06.880
they had every opportunity to enter into rest in the Promised

295
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:07.783
Land.

296
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.340
But they refused to worship and obey God alone.

297
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.920
God had it for 'em, but they refused. They rebelled against God.

298
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.790
How'd they rebel? They turned against Moses, right?

299
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.150
They had this leader named Moses that God had appointed and they turned against

300
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.030
him and rebelled against God.

301
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:32.710
They didn't believe God's promises were better than the sin that they wanted.

302
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.460
They didn't believe. So they disobeyed.

303
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.660
That's why that first generation,

304
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.860
the ones who were redeemed out of slavery needed,

305
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.020
saw all the miracles That first generation wandered in the desert for 40 years.

306
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.980
And that first generation was not allowed into the Promised land

307
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.650
Because they chose these other things instead of believing God.

308
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.160
And so Moses, that was their experience with him. But then there was also,

309
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.760
we see in verse eight here in Hebrews four,

310
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.440
this man named Joshua just kinda randomly throws him in there. But,

311
00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.680
but re, the reason Joshua's in here is because Joshua was Moses' successor.

312
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.850
And Joshua in fact was,

313
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.170
was one of the few original first generation out of Egypt

314
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.890
Israelites, who did believe in God, who did believe God's promise.

315
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:31.090
And so he was one of the few handful that did get to go in to the promised land.

316
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.530
In fact, Joshua got to lead them in the second generation.

317
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.890
God used Joshua to lead them into the promised land.

318
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.960
But notice did you see in verse eight

319
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.520
for if Joshua had given them rest,

320
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.960
God would not have spoken of another day later on. And so notice,

321
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.280
even though they were in the promised land at this point,

322
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.680
they still didn't have true rest.

323
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.930
They're even in the land that that day, if rest is still coming in the future,

324
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.290
Hebrews four says,

325
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.480
'cause remember once they went into the land,

326
00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.040
they still just kind of bounced around fighting battles against these other

327
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.640
nations. Even when they kind of settled down a little bit,

328
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.400
their hearts were still bouncing around following all these other gods.

329
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.030
So again, if we're talking true spiritual rest,

330
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.690
Moses didn't, Joshua didn't,

331
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.770
the Israelites did not experience this rest.

332
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.130
There was still a different day coming,

333
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.780
a better leader coming.

334
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.280
Well we already had the spoiler as we read through chapter four, right?

335
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.920
It's Jesus, we know that Moses couldn't, Joshua couldn't.

336
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.160
But Jesus is the better. Moses is the better. Joshua,

337
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.640
this is the one who can give true rest.

338
00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.680
Jesus was and is the day later on that Hebrews four talks about where true rest

339
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.523
would come.

340
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.800
Jesus is the God man who would say this in Matthew chapter 11

341
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.480
verses 28 through 30. Jesus said,

342
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.880
come to me all who labor and are heavy laden. And I will give you rest.

343
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.440
Take my yoke upon you.

344
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.200
Learn from me for I'm gentle and lowly and heart and you will find rest.

345
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.200
Check this out for your souls.

346
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.870
For my yoke is easy. My burden is light.

347
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.020
So Jesus is offering rest for our souls here.

348
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.230
They get rest in the promised land. They get in the land. But no, no, they,

349
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:43.990
they didn't have rest for their souls. Jesus is saying,

350
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.350
here's what rest actually is. It's for your soul.

351
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.990
That's the good news that Hebrews four,

352
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.870
two was referring to when Jesus would live and die and resurrect in our place

353
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:58.630
to give us soul rest that they had to look

354
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.390
forward to. It's what we enter by faith.

355
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.350
It's what Israel could not enter due to a lack of faith.

356
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.710
They couldn't trust God, didn't believe God. And so they didn't have rest.

357
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.350
They didn't see God's promises as good. They chose other ways.

358
00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.030
This is what Jesus offers.

359
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.710
The question I was thinking of as I was writing that is,

360
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.710
is that something that you have done

361
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:34.270
to be like Israel turning away from the true rest belief in God? Faith?

362
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.550
Have you, have you turned to all these other rest stops

363
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.970
instead of Jesus, instead of faith in God and his promises?

364
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.520
Maybe that's you, but you have done,

365
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.610
maybe that's what you're doing right now and you're seeking rest in all these

366
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:58.090
other things. Remember, your heart is restless until it finds its rest in him.

367
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.990
It's why you're exhausted. It's why you're tired. It's why you're frustrated.

368
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.290
'cause you're seeking rest everywhere else instead of what it was designed for.

369
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.500
See the fact that three times in Hebrews three and four, it quotes Psalm 95,

370
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:20.660
this today verse right today, don't harden your hearts, it brings it forward.

371
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.860
It means it matters for us today just as much as it did back then.

372
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.690
'cause Hebrews four, nine says,

373
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.330
there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

374
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:36.490
So we've got to be honest with ourselves and look at our experience of whether

375
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.690
we truly trust in the Lord and rest in the Lord or not.

376
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.770
This has to be something we consider. Every one of us in our own lives are,

377
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.810
are we like Israel?

378
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.070
I mean at times we all are,

379
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:56.030
but but what in my life looks like Israel refusing to believe God's promises

380
00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:00.940
are better than anything that I, I can find here how much of my day, my life,

381
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.740
my thought process, my actions shows I,

382
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.860
I don't really want what God promises. I want what all this other stuff has.

383
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.000
Like let's be honest with ourselves about that.

384
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.740
Where am I searching out what I'm only meant to find in Jesus?

385
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.950
That's why Hebrews four verses 11 through 13 point us to one way we can seek

386
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.310
this rest in Jesus. It says,

387
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:32.310
let us therefore strive to enter that rest so that no one may fall for this.

388
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.870
By the same sort of disobedience,

389
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.670
the word of God is living and active sharpening two-edged sword,

390
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.150
piercing to the very core of who we are,

391
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.190
discerning the thoughts and intentions of our hearts.

392
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.870
And no creatures hidden from his sight but all are naked and exposed to the eyes

393
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.430
of him to whom we must give an account.

394
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.330
And so unlike Israel and the wilderness, remember they,

395
00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.090
they heard the words of God, the promises of God.

396
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:05.770
And they refused to believe them, refused to obey them. For us,

397
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.810
we are to rest in God's word.

398
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.530
We're to rest in scripture so we don't fall away like they did.

399
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.050
Like we've been given God's word too.

400
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.730
Are we going to deny it and disbelieve it and say,

401
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.850
forget that we have our own plan or are we gonna follow him?

402
00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.360
But if you see the first few words of verse 11, it says,

403
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.480
strive to enter that rest. When we talk about rest,

404
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.120
it doesn't mean lazily sitting on a couch somewhere

405
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:38.930
In God's word.

406
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.080
Rest means striving in God's power for God's

407
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.050
purposes. Paul said that in one of his letters. So he's,

408
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.690
he's working with all the energy that God works within him. Again,

409
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.330
he's working harder than everybody else but not because he has to because God is

410
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.650
working through him. It's what James one even reminds us.

411
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.130
It says be doers of the word.

412
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.330
Not hearers only deceiving yourselves.

413
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.890
If anyone's a hearer of the word and not a doer,

414
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.090
he's like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.

415
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.130
He looks at himself, goes away once forgets what he was like.

416
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.650
But the one who looks into the perfect law,

417
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:24.290
that's God's law of liberty and perseveres being no hearer who

418
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.210
forgets, but a doer who acts. He will be blessed in his doing.

419
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.250
Right? So Israel in the wilderness heard God's word.

420
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.290
They refused to let the scalpel of God's word cut away things

421
00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.450
that were not of him.

422
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:44.683
Will we,

423
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.460
will we refuse to let God's word cut what needs to be cut?

424
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.860
Will we refuse to obey God's word and will we,

425
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:58.420
will we stop striving to enter his rest? 'cause again,

426
00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.700
blessed in all his doing. What is that talking about?

427
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.860
That's talking about the way life works.

428
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.660
It's good to obey God 'cause he designed it a certain way

429
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.940
because if he says in Hebrews four, strive to enter that rest,

430
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.340
doesn't that sound like works?

431
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.100
And James one says you need to be obedient doers of the word.

432
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.620
Doesn't that sound like, man, we're gonna be working a lot more.

433
00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.380
I thought God rested from his works.

434
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.870
I I thought we don't have to do anything anymore 'cause God did it all for us.

435
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.350
No, that's what this is saying.

436
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:38.010
The the deliverance of God brings about

437
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.033
obedience.

438
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.430
The trust we have in God's plan is what brings about

439
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.080
striving. 'cause again, like I just said,

440
00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.540
God designed life to work one way. When we walk his pathway,

441
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.020
that's restful. When we walk a different path, what happens?

442
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.420
Carnage, chaos. Life is harder.

443
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.940
Now it doesn't mean life is perfect,

444
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.020
but it sure means things work a lot better when we do it God's way.

445
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.730
And so we rest in his word.

446
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.180
But that's the other way. We strive to enter God's rest.

447
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.740
We have to do that by faith.

448
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.540
We rest in him by faith,

449
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.910
trusting his word in faith.

450
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.150
Now first that's an eternal rest.

451
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.350
Faith is, is what gives us eternal rest.

452
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.360
Now here's, here's a little glimpse into biblical theology.

453
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.720
This is like studying the whole Bible as one.

454
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.600
We can trace the entire storyline of God's word from the

455
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.820
garden of Eden in Genesis one all the way to the very end in Revelation

456
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.980
21 and 22, the garden of the new creation.

457
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.190
And you think about Adam and Eve in the original garden before sin,

458
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.270
they had perfect rest, perfect fellowship with God,

459
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.310
perfect fellowship with each other and with creation,

460
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:15.430
God is one day going to redeem all of that and give us perfect rest again

461
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.070
in him relationship with him, relationship with each other,

462
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.350
relation with creation. All that's coming back.

463
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.910
It's like page one and page whatever one is on the end of your Bible.

464
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.070
It's all of that, right?

465
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:33.570
So that's the storyline of God's redemptive

466
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:34.403
history.

467
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.210
It's rest at the beginning and it's rest at the end.

468
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.130
This is an eternal rest.

469
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.860
That's why above all else,

470
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.140
when you hear God's voice today,

471
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.380
don't harden your heart like Israel did in the wilderness.

472
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:56.003
They

473
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.410
Didn't believe.

474
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.950
When you hear God's voice when he's speaking to you today,

475
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.960
not me, when he's speaking to you today, don't harden your heart.

476
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:16.040
Turn from your sin. Turn from yourself and trust in Jesus' life,

477
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.120
death and resurrection in your place.

478
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.920
When you hear that, that's the hope eternally.

479
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.800
That's what gives you rest eternally. Don't harden your heart to it. You,

480
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.800
you can get the rest he's offering and just think about what that rest

481
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.640
means for a second. That means you have no fear of death anymore.

482
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.090
No fear of eternity. No fear of being separated from God ever again.

483
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.930
That's restful, isn't it?

484
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.960
And and again, it's restful.

485
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.360
Not because you were able to work your way out of it somehow,

486
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:53.520
it's because Jesus has done it all for you. That's rest.

487
00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:01.210
So there's eternal rest in Jesus that's absolutely critically the most important

488
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.450
part of all of this.

489
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.350
But there's also some practical applications as we go through our lives about

490
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.280
how this rest plays out. And it starts even weekly.

491
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.533
There's

492
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.280
A weekly rest rests.

493
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.320
'cause remember on the seventh day God rested from his works.

494
00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.750
He didn't need to but he did. He stopped what he was doing.

495
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.510
It shows up again in the fourth of the 10 Commandments, Sabbath.

496
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.190
Jesus blessed it in Mark two. He says it's given to humans as a break from work.

497
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.720
Six days, one off right? Add it all up.

498
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.760
You trace that all throughout scripture.

499
00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.840
It reminds us that we were never meant to work 24 7.

500
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.560
We're never designed to work 24 7.

501
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.120
And so God wants us to trust him by faith

502
00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:02.280
that he will provide for us in six days what we think we can produce in seven.

503
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.740
That was agricultural back then, right? They, they worked six days,

504
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.220
let it rest on the seventh day they get back to it.

505
00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.700
They always had more than if they refused and worked on the seventh.

506
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.430
Listen, that's one place I got off track.

507
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.300
Why was that adrenaline faucet running so hard? It's because I had no limits.

508
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.140
I thought I had to and, and this was, I would never have said this out loud,

509
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.340
but I, I kind of internally thought I had to keep this kingdom thing going.

510
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.820
Like I had, I gotta advance the kingdom myself in my own power.

511
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.540
And so I could never shut it off. I always gotta answer one more email.

512
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.540
I gotta gotta study one more thing. I gotta respond one more thing on social.

513
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.540
I have to do all of these things. But this

514
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:53.140
Reminds us that part of rest,

515
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.340
part of rest involves trusting the Lord for his provision and for

516
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.780
his results in my life.

517
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.520
It's been said this way, our heavenly Father never gives us too much to do.

518
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:15.310
People will and we assign ourselves an overload,

519
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:16.630
but never the Lord.

520
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.790
He knows what he wants from each of us.

521
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.670
And there's plenty of time in his day for things essential to his plan.

522
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.140
We do him a grave injustice when we fall into the habit of compulsive

523
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.453
overwork.

524
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.810
Even Jesus stepped away at times, didn't he?

525
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:43.810
He could have constantly gone.

526
00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:47.370
He could have been in the crowd and seen the fame. Even his disciples were like,

527
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.850
Hey Jesus, let's go over here. Let's, let's leverage your fame.

528
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.530
These people want know these crowds over here. And Jesus is like, nah,

529
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.290
actually we're going this way 'cause there's one person over here I need to talk

530
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.370
to or I'm, I'm gonna go up on the mountain by myself for a while.

531
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.490
Like Jesus himself pulled away.

532
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.570
Yet I somehow think I'm indispensable.

533
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.290
Like we need to remember

534
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.490
God is doing just fine without us.

535
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.023
And

536
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.980
Maybe I'm just talking to myself here that God's doing just fine without me.

537
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.540
He doesn't need me yet.

538
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.180
I think somehow I've got to keep this thing going.

539
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.900
But that comes back to the final practical application of Jesus being our rest.

540
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.910
It shows up daily. Yeah, we got this weekly rhythm,

541
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:38.630
but every day,

542
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:43.270
every moment God shows up as our rest daily.

543
00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.360
See, just like God rested from his labors,

544
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.620
just like he gave Israel rest in the promised land,

545
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.460
he promised it.

546
00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.740
He provided this one day per week rest for his people.

547
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:02.490
Hebrews four,

548
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.180
nine says that there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

549
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.970
It's still there. And,

550
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:13.970
and so that remember is not just a physical rest

551
00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.890
Where we take time off from work. It's a true spiritual rest.

552
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.490
It's what verse 10 continues.

553
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:26.370
For whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God

554
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:30.850
did from his. This is what I mean by a daily rest. This is a,

555
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:35.930
a soul rest where you and I daily find the comfort in

556
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.530
the fact that we don't have to try and earn our salvation anymore.

557
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.530
Like we don't have to try to keep track and and balance the scales and make sure

558
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.770
we're gonna be good before God. Because later in Jesus,

559
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:50.850
we find that he offers complete rest from the labor of our self

560
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:51.903
effort

561
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:53.720
Because

562
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.500
His work counts for ours.

563
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.610
Hebrews 10 12 later says,

564
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:05.490
he offered one sacrifice for sins forever and then sat

565
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.370
down at the right hand of God.

566
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:13.380
It's kind of going back to God in creation, right? He rests on the seventh day.

567
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.020
Jesus did the work and then he rested.

568
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:19.430
He had completed,

569
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:24.830
he ceased from the labor of atonement because there was nothing more to be

570
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:29.480
done ever. He offered for sacrifice for sins,

571
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.000
one sacrifice.

572
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.900
And it was good for everyone every time,

573
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.580
every historical era. It was good enough, it was enough.

574
00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:44.390
And so he sat down and rested. That's how we rest.

575
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.880
Because when we remember that,

576
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.240
that means we don't have to achieve God's favor anymore.

577
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.080
We don't have to try to earn God's favor anymore. It is given to us.

578
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.500
You don't have to try to,

579
00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.500
to work your knuckles to the bone to try to be good enough to be religious

580
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.620
enough. You don't have to do that anymore because Jesus gives it to you.

581
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.020
Is that not freeing? Listen, if that's your identity,

582
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.060
if you are a child of God by faith, resting in Christ,

583
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.540
his work counts for yours. That's rest.

584
00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.590
That's how we can stand here and we can just say to Jesus,

585
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.430
singing as loud as we can with our arms wide open saying, Jesus, I'm yours.

586
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.350
You are my firm foundation. I can't do anything.

587
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.030
And we're proud of that in some ways, right? I can't do anything. God,

588
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:35.480
you've got it all. You did it all. Praise God. That's rest.

589
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.840
If you're sitting there and you're trying to debate with yourself whether you're

590
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.320
good enough, that's not restful. I mean, I hope I did enough this week.

591
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:50.170
Hope I wasn't too bad 10 years ago. That's not a soul rest, is it?

592
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.250
This, this is what we're talking about.

593
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.130
Rest in Jesus and think about what that allows you to do. Now,

594
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.010
if that's where you land, if that's your confidence,

595
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.050
you don't have to listen to the accusations of the enemy anymore

596
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.830
'cause they're covered, right? Jesus knew you were gonna do it.

597
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:11.000
Jesus covered it with his blood. So the enemy tosses it back in your face.

598
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.520
You say, yeah, I know, but Jesus paid for it.

599
00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.310
It's covered, it's gone. It's done. When you're resting in Jesus daily,

600
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:23.030
you don't listen to the enemy. You're free also to obey Jesus.

601
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.070
Even if it costs you a lot,

602
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:31.070
You're free to give generously because you know you have it all in the end. And

603
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.033
what is this stuff?

604
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.210
Just give it away because Jesus is all I have and I've got him forever.

605
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.500
You're free to go on mission because what can man do to you and kill you? Okay?

606
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.260
I get to be with Jesus. They make fun of you.

607
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.460
Like I don't care what you think Jesus approves to me.

608
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.340
You're free to not be on social media because it's really just a big

609
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:02.340
self-promotion platform anyway. Why do I need you to impress you?

610
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.540
I could just be secure resting in Jesus.

611
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:16.370
We can stop trying to blend worldly ambition with the mission of the church and

612
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:21.090
we can just let God be God. And our job is just to be faithful.

613
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.020
We just be obedient and let God take care of the results.

614
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.520
You can humbly sleep. If you're resting daily,

615
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.840
you can humbly sleep like the farmer in the mark four parable that Jesus talked

616
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.480
about who scattered the seed. He goes to bed, he wakes up,

617
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.720
and somehow that thing sprouted how?

618
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.720
Because God causes the growth.

619
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.790
And so when you've scattered the seed in your life,

620
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.550
whether that's spiritual or even in your workplace, whatever it is,

621
00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:00.270
and you've set that out and you just say, God, okay, this is your deal.

622
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:05.910
You can humbly sleep in that. Do you remember what Psalm 1 27 said last week?

623
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.300
Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain,

624
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.210
unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.

625
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.770
It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest.

626
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:24.090
Eating the bread of anxious toil for he gives to his beloved

627
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.573
sleep.

628
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.190
You can rest because God never does.

629
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:32.350
You

630
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.850
Can You can rest because God's the one who causes the growth.

631
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.530
You can rest because God's the one who provides, who protects.

632
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:43.650
You don't have to try to keep yourself safe. God protects his people

633
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:52.250
again by faith, by trusting his word, his promises,

634
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:57.250
by believing that our good God is better than anything else this world

635
00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.630
can offer. He is our true rest.

636
00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:05.390
He is where true life is found. And so give him your sin today.

637
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.250
Give him your shame. Give him your past.

638
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.210
Give him your future.

639
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.930
Give him your life because his ways are better.

640
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:21.470
That's rest.
