1
00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:04.365
Amen.

2
00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:09.005
Amen. Amen. You can have a seat, church. What a day.

3
00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.165
It's a great day.

4
00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:13.045
And so if you've been around this summer, you know

5
00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:16.325
that we are walking phrase by phrase through Romans 12.

6
00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:20.005
And what we're looking at is what a, a life transformed

7
00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:22.805
by Christ actually looks like day to day.

8
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.325
Uh, what is that? Uh, that offering of our lives to God

9
00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:28.645
as a living sacrifice

10
00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:32.565
because of what Jesus has done, we offer ourselves to him.

11
00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:34.885
How do we then realign our lives?

12
00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:37.685
Not to conform to the world's way,

13
00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:40.405
but to the way Jesus lived his life.

14
00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:43.605
So we're looking at all of the aspects of life

15
00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:45.125
that show up like that.

16
00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:47.765
And so the last couple weeks, what we've seen is

17
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:51.885
how we can rejoice in hope, even while we endure tragedy,

18
00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:53.925
suffering, trials, tribulations.

19
00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:57.645
Well, it's interesting because in that verse,

20
00:00:57.695 --> 00:00:59.125
there are three phrases.

21
00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:03.525
Romans 12 verse 12. It, it says, rejoice in hope.

22
00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:09.005
Be patient in tribulation. Be constant in prayer.

23
00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.045
It's like those three are tied together,

24
00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:16.085
that the way we apprehend the joy

25
00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.125
through the suffering is through prayer.

26
00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:22.685
That's how we clinging to, it's how we hold onto it.

27
00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:25.725
And so that's what we're gonna look at today. That's it.

28
00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:27.085
And really, it's an interesting

29
00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:29.285
word in the original language.

30
00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:30.365
Be constant is one word.

31
00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:34.525
And that word is used a few times in the New Testament.

32
00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:36.605
And it talks about persistence

33
00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:39.205
that you are continuing to do.

34
00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:40.605
You're devoted to an action.

35
00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:41.605
You're gonna do it over and over.

36
00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:44.485
You're disciplined in a way that is going to be a part

37
00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:46.205
of your normal life's rhythm.

38
00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:52.045
It's used in Acts 2 42 where the church was devoted.

39
00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:54.165
The early church devoted themselves to prayer.

40
00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:57.965
Acts six, four were the, the original elders, the apostles.

41
00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:01.045
They said, we need to devote ourselves to prayer.

42
00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.445
They were committed to it.

43
00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:05.485
The early church was giving attention to prayer

44
00:02:05.485 --> 00:02:07.645
that this was something they do.

45
00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:11.125
Which by the way, is a challenge to all of us.

46
00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:17.365
You ask any group of Christians, what are the things

47
00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:19.605
that you need to grow in, things you need to get kind

48
00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:21.645
of work on in your Christian life?

49
00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:24.445
And prayer will always be one of the top.

50
00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.645
This is one of the weakest parts of our Christian lives.

51
00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:34.245
How little we devote ourselves, give attention to prayer.

52
00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:38.495
But it's interesting as we think about that phrase,

53
00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:42.815
be constant, how the King James version translated this

54
00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:45.775
verse, because they were using Latin, uh,

55
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:47.455
manuscripts and things like that.

56
00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:50.695
And, and the way it says it in King James version

57
00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:54.455
is continuing instant in prayer.

58
00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:57.615
Now, we don't speak like that.

59
00:02:57.645 --> 00:02:59.650
It's really hard for us to understand sometimes

60
00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:01.685
how the King James phrase things.

61
00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:05.205
But, but we've modernized it to be constant in prayer.

62
00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:10.125
Continuing instant though, our, our shift to modern

63
00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:12.885
language has kind of lost something.

64
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.285
I think because you think continuing instant,

65
00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:18.405
there's an urgency to it.

66
00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:22.805
Like instant is now. It's today, right now we have to do it.

67
00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:24.005
We can't not do it.

68
00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:26.325
Continuing instant in prayer is

69
00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:28.085
what the early church was doing, right?

70
00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:29.965
They had to pray. There was no other option.

71
00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:33.925
They had to do it. Now, it was urgent. It must be instant.

72
00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:36.645
It must be the default. It was their go-to.

73
00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:40.125
They had no other option. It was their first step.

74
00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:44.845
Is that for us? Is that the first step for us?

75
00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:48.805
Sadly, I don't think it is.

76
00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:56.635
We have so many resources at our disposal and,

77
00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:58.915
and we, we live our lives.

78
00:04:00.295 --> 00:04:01.515
Now, we would never say this,

79
00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:06.875
but we live our lives as if we don't really need God.

80
00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:11.715
We don't need 'em at all. We just live our lives now.

81
00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:14.395
Now, one of our churches' values that we,

82
00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:16.275
we recognize this a couple years ago.

83
00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:18.235
We reshaped our values as a church.

84
00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:20.795
And one of them is called desperate dependence.

85
00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:24.795
Desperate dependence is that we rely on the Holy Spirit

86
00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:26.555
to empower our lives

87
00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:30.755
and the church as we humbly abide in Jesus,

88
00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:36.195
recognizing that we can do nothing on our own, right?

89
00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:40.395
That that's what we want to do. But is it really true of us?

90
00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:42.915
Like it's kind of an aspirational value,

91
00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:43.955
meaning we wanna be that.

92
00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:47.635
We want to do that, but we really honestly don't.

93
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:49.515
How often in our lives and,

94
00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:52.355
and really times in our church, how often do we jump

95
00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:56.755
to pragmatic solutions rather than desperate dependence?

96
00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:00.995
We, we have all the options. We can make it happen.

97
00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:03.275
We can put enough resources to this.

98
00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:05.235
We can have enough programs to do this.

99
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:09.195
And so we jump to that stuff rather than depending on God

100
00:05:09.195 --> 00:05:11.235
to do what only he can do.

101
00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:12.875
I had somebody ask me a question

102
00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:15.355
as a young pastor 15 years ago.

103
00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:19.355
They asked the question, if the Holy Spirit was removed from

104
00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.715
your church, would anything change?

105
00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:30.475
Like the, are we trusting God to do what only God can do?

106
00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:34.315
Or are we so good at doing all the things ourselves

107
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:37.075
that we wouldn't even recognize if he was gone?

108
00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:40.685
It can't be that, right?

109
00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:44.485
It must be devoted to dependence,

110
00:05:44.915 --> 00:05:47.525
desperate dependence on God.

111
00:05:47.665 --> 00:05:48.965
And so what we wanna do

112
00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:52.525
as a church is we wanna realign our lives

113
00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:55.005
with Christ's perfect standard.

114
00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.405
Like, like, we're gonna try to move

115
00:05:57.405 --> 00:05:59.005
that direction by his power.

116
00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:00.285
And so we know,

117
00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:02.285
and listen, I know I'm gonna say baby

118
00:06:02.285 --> 00:06:03.445
steps a couple times here.

119
00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:05.285
Some of you're like, I'm way past baby steps.

120
00:06:05.655 --> 00:06:08.125
Let's just be honest. If we're not Jesus yet,

121
00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:09.405
we still have room to grow.

122
00:06:10.435 --> 00:06:13.125
Okay? So, so don't get, don't think too highly of yourself.

123
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:14.405
Like there's ways you can grow

124
00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:16.245
and maybe you're thinking you're

125
00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:17.325
further along than you really are.

126
00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:19.325
I do that all the time, that I'm further,

127
00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:21.005
I know I'm actually, I'm really not.

128
00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:22.045
If I'm just doing this.

129
00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:24.965
I think I'm here, but I'm actually here.

130
00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:28.485
And so we're gonna take some baby steps to grow in this.

131
00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:29.765
We're gonna practice prayer today.

132
00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:31.525
And then we're gonna take a couple other

133
00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:32.645
steps outside of this.

134
00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:36.485
Because if this must be a habit, this must be a rhythm.

135
00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:38.885
And if it's gonna be one of those, if it's gonna be a habit,

136
00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:40.725
it's gotta go beyond this room.

137
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:42.685
It can't just be in here

138
00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:44.405
that every Sunday we gather and we do this.

139
00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:46.605
Okay, great. If it's gonna be a rhythm in our lives,

140
00:06:47.435 --> 00:06:49.885
realign our lives, it's gotta be something more.

141
00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:52.685
And so that's why today we are kicking off

142
00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:55.965
what we're calling the 1212 prayer initiative.

143
00:06:57.185 --> 00:06:59.445
1212 prayer initiative.

144
00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:01.965
I asked my sons yesterday if they could figure out why we

145
00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:03.085
called it 12.

146
00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:05.845
12. And it took a little while, but we got there.

147
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:10.085
Romans 1212 says,

148
00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:11.325
be constant in prayer.

149
00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:13.605
So we're super creative around here.

150
00:07:13.605 --> 00:07:15.645
We're gonna call it 1212 prayer initiative, right?

151
00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:18.285
So that's what we're talking about this, this idea

152
00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:20.325
of wanting to be constant in prayer.

153
00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:22.365
We want to initiate something

154
00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:24.365
that's gonna give us room to grow.

155
00:07:24.595 --> 00:07:27.125
It's baby steps, but it's something to start with.

156
00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:29.565
So here's what it is.

157
00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.125
We've been reading the Bible together over

158
00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:34.245
the last couple of months.

159
00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:35.685
If you're getting that email, you see

160
00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:36.805
that we've been reading the Bible together.

161
00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:40.645
We also want to begin praying together more regularly.

162
00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:42.925
Now, it doesn't mean all of us in the room together.

163
00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:46.845
It means all of us at the same time together during the week

164
00:07:48.645 --> 00:07:50.725
Thursdays at, can you guess the time?

165
00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:54.085
12, 12:00 PM right?

166
00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:57.085
So that's what we are going to begin

167
00:07:57.265 --> 00:07:59.925
to build into the rhythm of our lives of our church,

168
00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:04.405
the 12:12 PM on Thursdays, just for a few minutes maybe,

169
00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:08.845
or for longer, just to devote ourselves more regularly

170
00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:10.285
to prayer.

171
00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:12.845
So here's how we're gonna kick this off.

172
00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:14.365
I want you to, you have permission

173
00:08:14.365 --> 00:08:15.685
to pull your phone out right now.

174
00:08:17.335 --> 00:08:18.605
Maybe you left yours in the car.

175
00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.885
That's some people's wise decision. I get that.

176
00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:22.925
But make a note, you'll want to do this later.

177
00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:25.125
Pull out your phone, whatever version

178
00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:27.965
of whatever phone you have, find the alarms,

179
00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:29.685
go find the alarms.

180
00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:36.315
And what I am encouraging to you to do is to set an alarm

181
00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:39.155
for Thursdays every Thursday at

182
00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:42.595
12:12 PM I've got it on here.

183
00:08:43.135 --> 00:08:45.195
Be constant in prayer is the title of it.

184
00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:47.075
And I've got it set for every day.

185
00:08:47.455 --> 00:08:48.795
You can set it for every day,

186
00:08:49.055 --> 00:08:51.515
but at least, at least

187
00:08:52.075 --> 00:08:56.485
Thursdays at 12:12 PM you set an alarm that reminds you

188
00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:58.445
to be constant in prayer.

189
00:08:58.745 --> 00:08:59.925
And that all of us,

190
00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.805
the whole church is doing it at the same time.

191
00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:05.285
There's something about the momentum with that.

192
00:09:05.305 --> 00:09:06.485
But just think about what happens.

193
00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:10.005
This, you set that alarm, you're at lunch and,

194
00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:12.245
and you're, you're sitting there, your alarm goes off

195
00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:14.245
and you have to make a decision

196
00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:15.485
what you're gonna do with that.

197
00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:21.205
What a witness to say to someone that you're with.

198
00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:22.685
Say, Hey, listen, can we just stop for a moment?

199
00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:24.765
I, I, I wanna, is there anything I can pray for you about?

200
00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:27.725
But, but our church is praying at 12:12 PM on Thursdays.

201
00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:29.765
I would love to pray for this thing that we've,

202
00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:30.965
and I'll tell you about that in a second.

203
00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:33.405
But, but what we've decided to pray for today,

204
00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:35.005
can we just pray for a moment about that?

205
00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:37.205
What a witness, right?

206
00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:40.575
Like what a witness that would be to somebody

207
00:09:40.575 --> 00:09:42.655
who has no idea and they think you're crazy,

208
00:09:42.795 --> 00:09:46.375
but then you have a, an opportunity to share with them.

209
00:09:48.945 --> 00:09:51.925
Or, or maybe, maybe you're bold

210
00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:54.365
and you wanna start gathering a couple people together every

211
00:09:54.645 --> 00:09:56.685
Thursday at 12:12 PM

212
00:09:57.105 --> 00:09:59.285
and you say, Hey, let's do this every week together.

213
00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:01.205
Let's gather five or six of us together.

214
00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:04.725
Let's start praying at 1212 for our church, for ourselves,

215
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:06.125
for our lives, all of that.

216
00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:08.205
That would be an incredible opportunity

217
00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:11.165
because so many things in history

218
00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:15.445
that God has done in big ways go back to a group of five

219
00:10:15.445 --> 00:10:18.525
or six people praying together for God to move.

220
00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:20.965
What can God do with a few people

221
00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:22.285
praying together like that?

222
00:10:23.475 --> 00:10:24.805
What should you pray? Well,

223
00:10:25.685 --> 00:10:26.765
whatever the Lord brings to mind, of course.

224
00:10:26.785 --> 00:10:30.325
But in my weekly Wednesday email,

225
00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:35.445
I'm gonna begin including a section that has a scripture

226
00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:36.645
or a prayer point

227
00:10:36.955 --> 00:10:39.645
that we will all then pray together on that Thursday.

228
00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:43.125
So you got a 24 hour, we send it at Route noon on Wednesday,

229
00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.765
and you could get it then a day to look at it

230
00:10:46.085 --> 00:10:47.245
before that Thursday.

231
00:10:47.305 --> 00:10:49.805
Now, if you don't get my email on Wednesdays,

232
00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:52.245
that would be important for you to get then, right?

233
00:10:52.275 --> 00:10:55.965
Like, so what we're gonna do is on the, uh, QR code,

234
00:10:55.965 --> 00:10:58.085
on the seat back in front of you, it takes you to a website

235
00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:00.325
that we have that you can sign up for it there.

236
00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:03.885
You can also go to hhbc.com/connect on the notes.

237
00:11:03.885 --> 00:11:05.565
You'll see it there. It's all there.

238
00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:07.085
You can go sign up for that email

239
00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:09.285
because that's how we're gonna distribute

240
00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:11.205
what you can, what you can pray for.

241
00:11:11.465 --> 00:11:12.605
Now, you can pray for whatever you want,

242
00:11:12.665 --> 00:11:14.725
but we're saying you can pray for these things

243
00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:17.485
that we're going to intentionally as a church, pray

244
00:11:17.485 --> 00:11:19.445
for each week on that Thursday,

245
00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:23.165
because again, be constant in prayer.

246
00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:24.405
We want to grow in that.

247
00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:28.205
It's a baby step, at least Thursdays, if not every day

248
00:11:28.835 --> 00:11:32.645
baby steps towards growth into Christ's likeness

249
00:11:32.935 --> 00:11:34.525
where we're breathing in God's word.

250
00:11:34.525 --> 00:11:35.885
We're breathing out prayer and praise.

251
00:11:35.885 --> 00:11:37.005
We're breathing in God's word,

252
00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:38.485
breathing out prayer and praise.

253
00:11:39.385 --> 00:11:40.605
So we're doing that today to practice.

254
00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:43.365
That's what Thursdays at 1212 is about.

255
00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:46.285
Wherever you are doing it together,

256
00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:48.245
knowing we're all doing it at the same time,

257
00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:49.645
that is really powerful.

258
00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:52.085
So I wanna pray just briefly for God's blessing on that.

259
00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:53.765
We feel like he led us to that.

260
00:11:53.765 --> 00:11:56.125
And so we wanna make sure, uh, we're giving it to him.

261
00:11:56.155 --> 00:11:58.165
Lord, we do need you.

262
00:11:58.225 --> 00:11:59.725
We pray in desperate dependence,

263
00:11:59.725 --> 00:12:00.805
you would do something with this.

264
00:12:00.955 --> 00:12:03.565
It's, it's just a simple act, God.

265
00:12:03.565 --> 00:12:06.845
But, but we do see the example Jesus, you set

266
00:12:07.065 --> 00:12:08.445
of being constant in prayer.

267
00:12:08.505 --> 00:12:11.245
The early church set in being devoted to prayer.

268
00:12:11.305 --> 00:12:12.565
God, we want to be more of that.

269
00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:16.645
And so, Lord, just take this one step further towards

270
00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:18.405
alignment with you, that our lives

271
00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:21.805
and our hearts are, are oriented and geared towards you.

272
00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:25.925
Help us Lord. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

273
00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:32.365
And so if you notice today, we started with a prayer

274
00:12:32.465 --> 00:12:34.925
of praise by singing name above all names.

275
00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:37.165
We read the scripture, Psalm 95,

276
00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:38.525
which was a song or a prayer.

277
00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:41.885
We're gonna pray now. We started with praise.

278
00:12:41.885 --> 00:12:43.925
We're gonna pray now by waiting on God.

279
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.525
Prayer's a two way street. It's a communication with God.

280
00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:50.725
And if you know communication one way,

281
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:52.965
communication is not really that effective.

282
00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.285
Doesn't build a relationship.

283
00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:58.845
And so we have to then wait and listen to God.

284
00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:01.125
The primary way God speaks is in his word.

285
00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:02.925
That's first and foremost.

286
00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:06.085
But with his spirit inside of you believer,

287
00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:10.845
he also then will impress things upon you by his spirit.

288
00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:14.125
Things that will not necessarily be audible words,

289
00:13:14.665 --> 00:13:18.165
but direction or, or maybe wisdom

290
00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:21.525
or what steps to take or or clarity on the situation.

291
00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:26.125
God will do that through your waiting on him.

292
00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:30.045
So I'm gonna read Psalm 62, which talks about this.

293
00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:31.485
It's on your notes. You can look at it later.

294
00:13:31.485 --> 00:13:32.685
It's on the screens as well.

295
00:13:32.985 --> 00:13:34.765
But we're gonna practice this idea of waiting

296
00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:36.565
quietly on the Lord.

297
00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:41.005
So listen to what Psalm 62 says, for God alone, oh my soul,

298
00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:42.525
wait in silence.

299
00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:45.945
For my hope is from him.

300
00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:48.545
He only is my rock

301
00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:52.305
and my salvation, my fortress, I shall not be shaken

302
00:13:53.885 --> 00:13:57.825
on God rest my salvation and my glory, my mighty rock.

303
00:13:57.885 --> 00:13:59.545
My refuge is God.

304
00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:03.085
Trust in him at all times.

305
00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:06.645
Oh, people pour out your heart before him.

306
00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:10.525
God is a refuge for us. Sayah.

307
00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:13.965
So like that word sayah means,

308
00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:18.605
let's now leave some quiet space listening for

309
00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:21.965
that still small voice of God running to him as a refuge.

310
00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:23.725
Let's do that now.
