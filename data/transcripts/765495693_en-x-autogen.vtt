1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.100
Okay.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.900
Good evening.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
If you have not figured it out yet. I'm not Phil Sally.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.000
I am filling in for Phil. So.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.300
Three of you heard that really it

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.600
is something you may know already, but

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600
Carol feels wife Carol her

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.500
father died yesterday.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.500
And so they went to Broken Arrow to be with the family and so

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.100
we'll pray for them tonight and

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.100
Yeah as they process through that.

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.100
Handle that with the family extended. I think all the kids got to go

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
up there and see him before he passed but still.

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.200
You could be praying for them.

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.300
The men's tailgates tomorrow night and everything. He's up

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.200
there and Broken Arrow. So we're we're taking over that as well tomorrow,

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
but then here tonight. He asked

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.600
me to fill in and so I get to do this with you tonight and

19
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.500
kind of talk through.

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Chapter 9 reviewing week eight and looking into chapter

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.700
9 and so let me pray for us as we get started tonight.

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.600
Lord thank you for the time we get to spend talking about

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.300
disciple making thank you for the people who have committed

24
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000
over the last couple months to just invest.

25
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.200
Pour into each other learn grow

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.600
develop into this.

27
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.100
This command you've given us from Matthew 28 To

28
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.800
Go Make Disciples.

29
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.200
Baptizing and teaching to obey May that become normal

30
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.300
for us that become who we are as individuals and

31
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.400
who we are as a church. That's what you've given us as that directional vision

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.200
and we want to be that

33
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.400
So may this group catalyze many groups

34
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400
towards that end.

35
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.900
I pray for the silly family tonight, especially.

36
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.400
As you comfort them with the comfort that your spirit

37
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.500
gives.

38
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.400
I pray for Carol as she's now lost both parents.

39
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.100
I pray that you'd give her peace and the grandkids and

40
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.600
great grandkids that they would all see.

41
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.100
That this really as they've said is

42
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100
a good thing as they've seen him.

43
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500
Decline quickly.

44
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.600
And now he's home and so we're grateful for that truth and

45
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.000
the hope they have in you.

46
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.500
Grief, yes, but we grieve

47
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.300
with hope so give them peace this weekend

48
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.200
words to say counsel to give to those who

49
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.500
hurt.

50
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.100
Thank you. God help us tonight to see what you

51
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.800
have for us in Jesus name. Amen.

52
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.500
I do not have his iPad and so

53
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.600
we're just going to go old school. Okay, you're gonna

54
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.000
follow along. You've got the papers right in front of you if you

55
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.200
don't have those yet table at the back Jill can help you with that?

56
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.300
but we're gonna review quickly through the kind of main themes of

57
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.500
this whole 12-week section of

58
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.400
our lives and really

59
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.500
As we build into each week these truths that

60
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.400
the discipling pathway is how we move people from the

61
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.000
big gathering on a Sunday into a smaller

62
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.500
group called Community groups that

63
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
place where we have a lot of things that happen for our benefit

64
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
and growth and Community relationships. But

65
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.200
ultimately Down Deeper that that's not

66
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.500
the end game is just to be in a community group. It's to be trained and

67
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500
and developed equipped how to

68
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.100
love Jesus and live scent and then eventually to a disciple making group

69
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.900
like this. We call Micro groups or D groups three four

70
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.000
five people together as we've been talking about in this room.

71
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.500
Now a disciple we talk about making disciples and one

72
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.200
who's committed to following Jesus being changed by Jesus

73
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.400
and his mission is their focus. That's what we would Define

74
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.500
a disciple to be in a really small form.

75
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.200
And so when we talk about making disciples that means we need to

76
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.400
be shooting for that in our lives and others

77
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.400
lives having an intentional leader in this group relational environment

78
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.700
reproducible process that this can can multiply as

79
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.900
we've talked about becoming a hub for disciple

80
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.200
making here. That's what we want to see. This is how we

81
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.200
get there in many ways. Holy spirit's a

82
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.500
teacher the Bible's curriculum. The end product is transformation. You don't

83
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.700
have to have a degree you don't have to have all the training and

84
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.700
history in the church anything like that. If you have God's

85
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.400
word, you have the Holy Spirit in you and through you

86
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
and we look forward to transformation. That's really all

87
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.800
it is. And so we engage explorers. We connect Believers grow

88
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.200
disciples and go multiply.

89
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.100
That's the kind of pathway process. We're looking at

90
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.400
here.

91
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.800
so we're way down into this now looking at practical steps

92
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.100
from Etheridge and Ogden last week

93
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.400
the very similar recommendations if you remember that from last

94
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.000
time just

95
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.700
Overview quickly through those things really about

96
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.200
praying first like how you start a group is basically what

97
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.500
we're talking about.

98
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.500
Ogden first says to pray invite people

99
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.600
kind of cast The Vision tell them what is involved in

100
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.200
this have that conversation about what this looks like

101
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.700
expect certain things and then set this

102
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.200
meeting and get going. That's just what we want to do is

103
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.100
just get started.

104
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.200
It won't look the same a year 10 years from now than it does

105
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.300
right now just realize that it will grow and it

106
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.400
will change you will change your group will change you just gotta

107
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.500
get started. My tendency is to want to have it all figured out

108
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.800
before we get started. Like that's just not going to work with this you

109
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.300
can have principles and some some main themes,

110
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.400
but you just got to get going and watch the Lord work through

111
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400
and in you

112
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
So now we move into chapter 9 how to make disciples how to launch

113
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.200
really this launching of a micro group. We talked about

114
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.800
the the planning of it last week with Ethridge and Ogden.

115
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.200
Now, how do we actually launch it?

116
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.900
Now here's a question that is often brought up. This one-on-one versus

117
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.300
micro group one-on-one versus three to five

118
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
and that's a common conversation among disciple makers

119
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.300
people ask me all the time. As I was doing my doctoral work on

120
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.300
this. It was a Common Thread that like, okay. Well, I got

121
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.400
discipled one-on-one. This really worked for me. Of course. I got

122
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.200
discipled in a group with three and it really worked for me of course, right? So

123
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.300
there's not a right or wrong way to this.

124
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.400
And so we want to make sure that we don't exclude anyone for doing

125
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.500
one-on-one. It's not wrong both can

126
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.200
get to life transformation. We're investing in life.

127
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.500
But what we would say is that here's why

128
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.300
we would say three four, maybe five people are better

129
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.100
in this not right or wrong, but

130
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.200
just a little bit better because of these things if you're

131
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.300
a one-on-one setting if you miss a week, so to speak you're

132
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.700
you're two weeks out from a meeting now, ideally your

133
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.400
conversations happen throughout the week. So that's not just

134
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.700
the one time you talk.

135
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.200
But it just means you're you're not going to be able to sit down

136
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.200
for an hour together if you're one of you is out for whatever

137
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.600
reason.

138
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.600
So groups of three to four you have some some continuity that

139
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.100
you're going to be meeting every week pretty much if even if

140
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.700
one person misses, they're still consistency there. We

141
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.100
also see scriptures clear that this happens in groups a lot.

142
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.400
Now we see one-on-one in scripture. We also see groups a

143
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.400
whole lot in scripture. It's in the nature of God. It's

144
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.500
in the call to be in relationships between husband and wife in

145
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.400
Genesis 2. It's the family structure as we go forward.

146
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.300
That's God creating us to be in community

147
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.300
with people again one-on-one. Yes, but all

148
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.600
so for the most part in larger groups

149
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.100
than that all through the Old Testament, you see

150
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.100
these things show up of community examples the New

151
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.200
Testament shows examples of community even Jesus we've talked

152
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.600
about this a lot. He had crowds following him. He pulled

153
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.500
out 72 to make these these

154
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500
missional efforts into these cities and he'd send

155
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.100
them out two by two, but he pulled this 72 out of

156
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.500
the crowd then he pulled even 12 from there.

157
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.200
But then the three Peter James and John he pulled

158
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.500
even further out from them. He wanted to invest deeper

159
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.900
into these few that ended up being the leaders of the new church.

160
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.200
So he took people with him he was in community with people. That's

161
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.300
what God does to transform tribes and

162
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.200
communities and peoples and cultures.

163
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.600
We structured around these ideas of smaller groups.

164
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.200
Why is that important King Solomon? This is

165
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.600
Page Six you go into if Ecclesiastes 4:9.

166
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.200
King Solomon understood this the wisest man who ever lived he wrote

167
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.600
this down.

168
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.400
I think we should listen to that and so he says two are

169
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.200
better than one life is better when we live together.

170
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.300
Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their toil if

171
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.500
they fall one will lift up his fellow if but woe

172
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.300
to him who is alone when he falls has none other to lift him

173
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.400
up.

174
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.900
Again, if two lie together to keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?

175
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.400
Though a man might Prevail against one two will

176
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.400
withstand him a threefold chord is not quickly broken.

177
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.500
Just all throughout that that's a very familiar passage to

178
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.000
us who've been in church any length of time. We see two or better

179
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.300
than one. There's a good reward for that you start to learn from each

180
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.900
other differently than you would by yourself. You hear different insights two

181
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.200
or better than one in that sense.

182
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.400
We learn better together if they fall you'll be lifted up

183
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.500
that's talking about Shepherds right where they

184
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.200
would be kind of walking together in sort of close-knit groups.

185
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.200
And so the shepherd has

186
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.400
to go find a sheep that's down in the Ravine and he goes and gets

187
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.300
it and he can't get back up.

188
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.500
Shepherd puts his crook down there helps him up and all these things or

189
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.600
he falls down or hurts himself. They have brothers around

190
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:09.900
them.

191
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.200
So that's the idea even spiritually we're talking about is that you

192
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.100
need people around you.

193
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.400
And that's not easily found in a large

194
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400
group setting on a Sunday morning.

195
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.100
You can't have people that you can really lean on because you don't

196
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.300
even know most of those people at times you might know names and

197
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.200
faces, but you don't know their lives and they can't know you and you

198
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.600
don't trust deeply towards that end. So this

199
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.900
idea of two are better than one helps us learn and grow

200
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.500
and experience Community together to lie together

201
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.100
to keep warm, right? That's the idea. They're out in

202
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.400
the freezing desert by themselves. They

203
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.300
have a blanket. That's it. If you're together two or

204
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.200
three you can huddle together and keep warm from each other. That's the

205
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.000
idea of that.

206
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.400
So you find warmth in life in community, we're stronger together. That's the

207
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.200
two that can withstand one. That's the

208
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.900
three-fold Strand the threefold chord that's all showing

209
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.700
that we are stronger together.

210
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.400
So these ideas show us that it's yeah again,

211
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.100
we could debate the one versus the three or four

212
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.700
but still the point is you need someone we need someone around

213
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.100
us. We need people around us to be

214
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.600
stronger together think of the Roman soldiers when they'd

215
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.600
go into battle. They would have their Shields almost locked together

216
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.600
in the front even over the top. Sometimes they

217
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.100
would create this wall. So arrows are shooting

218
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.600
at them or or flaming bombs would

219
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.700
come at them and they would just huddle behind this and they would stand together

220
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.700
in this one by himself with dangerous,

221
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.100
but all the shields surrounding each other.

222
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.100
That's what we're talking about here.

223
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.600
Now we we talk about these groups in three to four maybe five

224
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.500
in a group those need to be I

225
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.400
would believe both men together or

226
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.100
women together.

227
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.100
And the reality is that you have Community groups many of us have Community groups that

228
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.500
are mixed men and women together some of your larger Community

229
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.300
groups that are just women or just men that's fine.

230
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.500
But the idea is that when you have mixed company men and women together, there's things that

231
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.700
you would not say.

232
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.700
That you might say in a group of three guys together.

233
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.700
Just that it's not I'm not saying something that's silly

234
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.200
or something. That's a poor joke a course joking I'm

235
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.900
saying things about your soul things about your struggling with you

236
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.700
wouldn't share in a large group where where there's

237
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.400
men and women together things that you don't really I don't

238
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.500
know those people very well.

239
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.400
And that's that's something that I don't feel comfortable talking

240
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.200
about in front of a man and those kind of things you get a group

241
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.800
of three or four women together or three or four men together and and

242
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.500
that's a lot more open a lot more willing. There's

243
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.200
trust and there's this there's this understanding that

244
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.200
we're all in this together.

245
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.500
And so I would say that's the best way to do this. I think there's

246
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.300
a risk involved if you start to mix that together in groups

247
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.300
of three or four.

248
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.600
Now what do we do now? I'm not going to go through this. This is pages eight through

249
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.700
the end. It really has a lot of detailed

250
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.600
instructions as you begin to think about planning

251
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.100
out your micro group your D group as you

252
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.200
go from this place in the next couple weeks as we launch you

253
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.000
out around Thanksgiving and say Here's what we're going to

254
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.800
do. We're gonna challenge you to start groups as Phil has

255
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.300
said repeatedly like the goal of this is not for us just to

256
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.200
be in here and to enjoy this study together. The goal is

257
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.300
to be a disciple maker because God's called you to and

258
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.100
equipped you to do that.

259
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.400
So how do you do that? These are some steps you go from the

260
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.300
middle of page eight.

261
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.600
in this section intentional leaders model

262
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.400
expectations

263
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.500
You need to be doing this first.

264
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.300
I'm talking to a men's Retreat Friday and

265
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.300
Saturday and I'm talking to men about what it looks about a minute

266
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.000
Church minute home minute work and one of

267
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.500
the things about being a man at home is like you better

268
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.300
be set in the pace in this thing including and

269
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.100
repentance when you blow it. If you want your kid to learn

270
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.600
how to repent you better know how to repent and lead them towards that so it's

271
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.300
the idea same thing here. If you're gonna be a leader of a group you got

272
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.300
a model what it looks like to be a part of this group.

273
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.500
And then you think of what the the curriculum you're

274
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.100
going to use if there's going to be any curriculum. I mean, obviously the Bible

275
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.400
itself can be your curriculum. But if if there's something else you

276
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.700
want to add in maybe a new believer needs something along

277
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.100
the way we got to think through what you're going to do with

278
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.500
that questions. You're gonna ask model expectations for

279
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.900
transparency as well.

280
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.200
That you're going to set the pace for how open your

281
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.600
group is.

282
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.800
Are you going to share some of the things that you struggle with? If you

283
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.400
don't they're not you need to open that up in

284
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.700
your own life because they need to relate to you.

285
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.200
So you kind of think through the planning of it. There are a lot of detailed instructions there

286
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.100
then the middle of 10 you get to the first few meetings. Okay. So now

287
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.400
we want to start this. What do we do?

288
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.200
How do we actually go about doing this? Well, you kind

289
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.100
of think through that Covenant idea. What are the expectations you get to know

290
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.200
each other which you have done in this room right getting to

291
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.800
know stories getting to know our hearts and who we are those things

292
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.800
are important share your faith Journey.

293
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.800
One of the things that I've had consistently told to

294
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.700
me throughout this process, I haven't seen it yet. But as I've

295
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.600
talked to plenty of disciple makers they've seen this happen where

296
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.200
you have somebody say in a community group

297
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.000
that's 30 people and you start to see like there's a couple

298
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.600
of us that we need to really pull out and get together in this way. And you start

299
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.400
talking about these things you start to expect certain things start

300
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.500
to ask questions about things.

301
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.400
Say tell us your faith Journey.

302
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.400
Tell us how you came to Christ. They can't tell you.

303
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.300
And through the course of the disciple making

304
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.500
group you make a disciple like somebody who's

305
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.800
not.

306
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.500
Comes to Faith in the middle of this becomes a disciple

307
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.700
of Christ through this process that they

308
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.100
thought they were believer, but then they could never share and they'd never had

309
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.300
anybody sit and challenge them on it and I don't mean confront them about it,

310
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.000
but just ask them.

311
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.400
If sat in church, they sat in a Sunday school class their entire life

312
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.400
never been asked that question.

313
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.300
But in a group of three people you're having a conversation about this and they

314
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.300
they stumble they don't know what belief is and

315
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:06.900
what faith is.

316
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.200
And you share the gospel and you lead them to Christ and then you're starting there.

317
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.600
I haven't seen it in my life in that context, but

318
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.200
I've heard it over and over that that happens.

319
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.000
Just by asking a faith Journey question.

320
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.800
And so you kind of lead that first stretch of time as as

321
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.200
an intentional leader, but then the

322
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.300
goal would always be to shift leadership away.

323
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.300
Like with my guys that I'm eating with tomorrow morning. My constant goal

324
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.300
is to say you guys can do this. It's not about me leading you this

325
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.300
is us leading each other you can do this. You can do this. So

326
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.000
where they feel like

327
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.800
At some point they can pick up and move on to lead

328
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.100
a number of guys themselves.

329
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.200
And then help equip them to lead and equip them to

330
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.400
lead. That's the point is yes. It takes initiation.

331
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.900
But then it doesn't mean you take it and run with it yourself forever.

332
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.700
You let people lead and you give them in responsibilities and

333
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.200
you help them understand they can do this, too.

334
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.500
Because if Jesus gave us this command to make disciples and that's

335
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.200
all of us.

336
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.400
Then we better all be able to know how to do it.

337
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.300
And I'll be equipped how to do it. So this is part of the process as a

338
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.000
leader you help them see how to do it.

339
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.100
Okay, so that's a quick blast through

340
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.200
you got some questions there that you can talk through about

341
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.000
this about when you're thinking ahead of how to plan and how to

342
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.100
get started with this. You got the micros group

343
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.600
discussion questions there and so just take that time as

344
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.300
we get into it. Normally we leave you

345
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.400
about an hour and so want to be faithful to that time if

346
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.400
you are here and this is your first time I don't

347
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.100
know if you've been here or not. So if this is literally your first time on

348
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.100
a Wednesday night where you're seeing things like this and hearing things like

349
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.300
that come up here and talk to me Jill will be

350
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.300
up here too. We can connect you to a group because that's the point of this is not just to listen

351
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.800
to lectures is to get into a group practice this so,

352
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.100
you know what to do when we go forward. So if it's your first

353
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.100
time come find us down here as soon as we do this break up

354
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.100
time here, and then we'll get you connected to a group, but I'm

355
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.200
so excited really again. I just wanted before we

356
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:07.700
break up. I

357
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.800
I've been dreaming about things like this for

358
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.700
seven years.

359
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.800
In a church. I started my doctoral work about

360
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.400
seven years ago now and this was

361
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.200
it relational disciple making in a church setting.

362
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.300
so I had studied and studied enough wanted to

363
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.500
see it happen and I've tried to start it kind of organically myself and

364
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:29.700
then

365
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.500
then God just plops in her lap. Here we go. And so

366
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.200
I'm so excited to see each one of you involved in this

367
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.400
wanting to do this.

368
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.200
You all going to feel over your head in this it's the

369
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.400
reality.

370
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.400
But the beautiful part of it is that you've got the holy spirit inside of

371
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.900
you as a believer.

372
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.400
And he says he's going to empower you

373
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.000
to do what your commanded to do. This is

374
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.700
not too hard for you scripture says

375
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.900
you can do it. And so I'm excited to see us do it.
