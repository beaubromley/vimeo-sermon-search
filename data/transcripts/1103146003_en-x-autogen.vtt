1
00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:34.965
Good morning.

2
00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:39.885
My name is Alan Rice and I'm an elder here in our church.

3
00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:43.005
I wanna start out this morning with my thesis

4
00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:46.685
to this sermon, which is simply one word, peacemaker.

5
00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:50.885
My subtitle to this thesis is a call to action,

6
00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:52.365
and it's just two words long.

7
00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:57.365
It is this, reach out right now.

8
00:00:57.365 --> 00:00:58.965
None of that makes any sense,

9
00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:01.485
but hopefully by the end of the sermon it will a little bit.

10
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:04.125
For the very first part of this sermon,

11
00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:05.525
I'm gonna tell a little story.

12
00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.485
For those of you that know me, you know that

13
00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.005
through no fault of my own

14
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.925
that I'm thrown into some crazy adventures.

15
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:16.685
From time to time, I, I don't know why.

16
00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:18.925
When I turned 65,

17
00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.605
I wondered if God was gonna stop sending me these crazy

18
00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.405
adventures because now I'm officially a senior citizen.

19
00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:29.125
But a few months after I turned 65, I had another adventure.

20
00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:32.205
So for now, they've not stopped coming at me.

21
00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:38.325
So I was at half price books on May near 63rd street,

22
00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:42.685
and uh, I was exiting after looking for books

23
00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.325
and the, uh, exit faces, uh, due south

24
00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:48.125
and there's a pretty good sized parking lot there.

25
00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:51.085
But I was parked in a little parking lot

26
00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:53.085
to the right on the west side.

27
00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:55.325
And so I get out

28
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:59.285
and I'm just walking down the sidewalk along the storefront,

29
00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.245
and there was a guy about 15 or 20 feet in front of me.

30
00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:05.405
Now, I guess he just left the store himself.

31
00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:07.485
So I'm just walking along,

32
00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:09.685
just not even paying attention to anything.

33
00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:13.685
This guy comes to the end of the sidewalk

34
00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:15.525
where it meets the parking lot.

35
00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:20.125
Suddenly he stops, doesn't about face

36
00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.485
and charges me screaming.

37
00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:25.245
Why are you following me?

38
00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:31.165
Well, for the first time, I'm focused on

39
00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:32.925
who this guy is a little bit, right?

40
00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:38.085
He is a 30 something Asian American man in good

41
00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:39.365
shape, okay?

42
00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.245
Now, I had a little bit

43
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:43.925
of martial arts training back in the 1980s,

44
00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:47.765
but if this guy never had 10 seconds of self-defense,

45
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.085
I knew if it came down to a fight, I,

46
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:51.365
it was gonna be bad for me.

47
00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:55.045
So he is charging right from my face

48
00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:57.925
and surprise to both of us.

49
00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:01.365
I dodged into my right out of his way

50
00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.245
and I keep going, okay?

51
00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:09.925
He stops, does another about face

52
00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:11.765
and goes, why are you following me?

53
00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.645
And I'm thinking, you're following me now, dude, you know,

54
00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:21.725
so, but the good news is, is that now he wasn't between me

55
00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:26.245
and my car, and so I start walking really fast,

56
00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:30.525
sideways to my right while he's still coming at me.

57
00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:35.885
I pull out my car, key fob, and I click the unlock button

58
00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:39.085
and my car's right over there

59
00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.845
and the little yellow, uh,

60
00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:44.045
rectangles on the side flash on the side of the headlights

61
00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:45.725
and he stops

62
00:03:46.545 --> 00:03:48.765
and he is like probably thinking what is going on?

63
00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:50.845
I go ahead and go over to my car

64
00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:55.005
and as I, I haven't said a word as I'm going to the door,

65
00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:59.325
he stops and he says, in the most

66
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:04.605
emotionally desperate voice you've ever heard, I'm sorry,

67
00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:11.565
we live in an age of rage.

68
00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:18.525
So after this incident, I happen to mention it

69
00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:22.765
to my daughter and she dia

70
00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:25.245
and she kind of explained to me why it may have happened.

71
00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:27.765
Apparently in the last five years,

72
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.165
Asian Americans have begun to be threatened

73
00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.485
and attacked all across the United States

74
00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:33.765
because of their race.

75
00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:37.205
Why? Because of COVID.

76
00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:41.045
I guess the completely illogical reasoning is

77
00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:45.045
that Asian Americans somehow cost CVI stupid.

78
00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:48.805
According to the Pew Research Center, about one third

79
00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:51.725
of Asian Americans know an Asian American

80
00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:54.565
who has been threatened or attacked because of their race.

81
00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:57.605
And Asian Americans aren't the only

82
00:04:57.605 --> 00:04:58.725
ones who feel victimized.

83
00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:01.245
About one third of African American adults

84
00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:05.245
said they worried every day that there might be threatened

85
00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:06.445
or attack because of their race.

86
00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:09.885
About one third of people who are poll believe

87
00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:14.645
that Hispanics who are in America legally face a lot

88
00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:15.645
of discrimination.

89
00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:18.685
Ironically, they're discriminated against

90
00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:21.925
because of the illegal Hispanic immigrants pouring into the

91
00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:23.285
country over our last four years.

92
00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:27.925
And many American Hispanics oppose illegal immigration

93
00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:30.085
and yet they're persecuted for it anyway.

94
00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.725
And then there's antisemitism.

95
00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:38.325
A few years ago, I would've thought that antisemitism

96
00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:41.805
and western civilization had died off with Adolf Hitler,

97
00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:43.925
but here we are again.

98
00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:48.845
According to Time Magazine, one third American Jews

99
00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:53.765
said they have been the personal target of antisemitism

100
00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:58.805
in person or virtually at least once in the past year.

101
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:03.525
We live in an age of rage.

102
00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:08.685
We need what the apostle Paul is going

103
00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:11.005
to tell us here in Romans chapter 12.

104
00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:15.405
We God's plumb line to help us see

105
00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:18.685
where we are building slanted walls

106
00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:21.045
that are leaning like the Tower of Pisan,

107
00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:22.925
a threat of falling over.

108
00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:28.245
We need God to put us in right alignment, straight up

109
00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:31.365
and down with his word and with his will.

110
00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:34.525
Let's look at the passage for today.

111
00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:37.565
Romans chapter 12, starting in verse 16.

112
00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:41.765
Live in harmony with one another.

113
00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:46.485
Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.

114
00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:52.205
Never be wise in your own sight, repay no one evil

115
00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:54.165
for evil, but give thought to do

116
00:06:54.475 --> 00:06:59.365
what is honorable in the sight of all if possible.

117
00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:04.165
So far as it depends on you live peaceably with all.

118
00:07:05.295 --> 00:07:06.645
Let's start with the very first sentence

119
00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:07.685
here and do some analysis.

120
00:07:07.815 --> 00:07:10.925
Verse 16, it says, live in harmony with one another.

121
00:07:11.995 --> 00:07:14.485
Paul is writing to the church in Rome.

122
00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:17.645
So the one another here is referring to fellow Christians.

123
00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:20.405
The ESV says, live in harmony,

124
00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:24.125
but the literal wording from the original Greek language

125
00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:27.645
here is he himself toward one another.

126
00:07:28.195 --> 00:07:32.765
Minding. Now that's obviously contorted when you try to turn

127
00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:33.805
that back into English,

128
00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:37.565
but what it's saying is, is that each one of us are

129
00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:41.325
to have it in our minds that fellow Christians are exactly

130
00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:43.605
the same as we are.

131
00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:47.685
They're not only to have the same worldview,

132
00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:51.325
but fellow Christians are who we identify with.

133
00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:55.005
They're not other. They are our people.

134
00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:58.165
Part of our inner circle, they are us.

135
00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:02.445
The great philosopher Aristotle stated that quote,

136
00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:04.725
A friend is a second self.

137
00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.205
In other words, a friend is another me.

138
00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:12.405
That's what the apostle Paul is saying here in our minds,

139
00:08:12.465 --> 00:08:14.925
our fellow Christians are to be exactly the same

140
00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:16.165
as we are very selves.

141
00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:20.445
For some reason, I've gained a reputation as a preacher

142
00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:21.965
who uses props in my sermons.

143
00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:26.285
I guess that's probably fair enough, enough.

144
00:08:26.285 --> 00:08:28.485
Today I'm gonna use two props that you

145
00:08:28.485 --> 00:08:29.725
and I have on us right now.

146
00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:33.405
I'm gonna use our arms for the first prop.

147
00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:35.565
I'm going to use the concept of a hug.

148
00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:39.165
So I want you to imagine that the fellow Christians

149
00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:43.125
that the apostle Paul declares are the same as us with

150
00:08:43.465 --> 00:08:46.445
as being within the literal circle of our arms,

151
00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.525
the circle of our harmony.

152
00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:55.125
So any, even in our inner circle,

153
00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:58.165
there are people closer to us than others.

154
00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.165
Our spouses, our our, our sons

155
00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:02.725
and daughters, our our best friends.

156
00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:04.765
They might be right up against our chest,

157
00:09:05.705 --> 00:09:08.405
but someone we kind of like in the church might be out

158
00:09:08.425 --> 00:09:11.165
by our hands, but they're still within

159
00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:15.805
that inner circle being the same as us in our hug zone.

160
00:09:17.345 --> 00:09:19.245
And even though the apostle Paul states

161
00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:22.165
that fellow Christians are to be of the same minding

162
00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:26.085
who we identify with, I don't think he means

163
00:09:26.155 --> 00:09:27.285
that we can't disagree.

164
00:09:29.265 --> 00:09:31.285
Of course, we are going to disagree.

165
00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:34.485
As an example, in Acts chapter 15,

166
00:09:34.545 --> 00:09:37.885
the apostle Paul himself disagreed passionately

167
00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:39.565
with Barnabas on whether

168
00:09:39.585 --> 00:09:41.925
to take John Mark on another mission trip or not.

169
00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:45.765
So right now, I want everyone in the room

170
00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:48.805
to put your arms out in a circle like this in a hug.

171
00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:51.965
Yeah, it's awkward, but that's the point.

172
00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:55.205
Okay, so everyone do this.

173
00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:58.445
I want you to think about the Christian friends,

174
00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:02.085
family members and church members that are inside

175
00:10:02.475 --> 00:10:05.725
that circle that you think of as you,

176
00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:07.725
your harmony zone.

177
00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:13.405
Now more importantly, I want you to think of those people

178
00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:16.805
outside your harmony zone.

179
00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:20.565
Who are Christian friends, family members, church members

180
00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:24.165
that you have placed outside of your harmony zone.

181
00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:26.485
Okay? Put your arms down.

182
00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:29.725
I want you to get out pen and paper or your cell phones.

183
00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:32.725
Turn the ringers off, and I literally want you

184
00:10:32.725 --> 00:10:34.965
to write down those names.

185
00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:39.405
Take a moment, actually. Literally write them down.

186
00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:00.525
Now, let's define what a Christian is.

187
00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:04.125
Christians are people who accepted Jesus Christ

188
00:11:04.225 --> 00:11:06.965
as their savior and as their Lord.

189
00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:11.685
By accepting Jesus as their savior, they're seeking Jesus

190
00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:16.085
to forgive them of all their sins, past, present,

191
00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:19.205
and future, which he can do

192
00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:23.045
because he lived a perfectly sinless life and bled

193
00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:25.085
and died on the cross so

194
00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.045
that he could forgive us of our sins.

195
00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:31.645
By accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord, they're declaring

196
00:11:31.645 --> 00:11:34.525
that he is the one in charge of their lives

197
00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:35.805
and not they themselves.

198
00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:41.125
They will serve Jesus and dedicate themselves to obey him

199
00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:46.045
and over time, to grow to become more and more like him.

200
00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:50.525
Now having to find what a Christian is, we have to establish

201
00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:54.285
what Christians believe, what they hold as right doctrine

202
00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:57.325
because you can't say that you're a Christian

203
00:11:57.665 --> 00:12:01.085
and then believe things about Jesus that aren't true at all.

204
00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:04.285
We have to believe in the Jesus of the Bible.

205
00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:08.045
You can't hold as a doctrine for example,

206
00:12:08.435 --> 00:12:10.325
that Jesus is Bigfoot

207
00:12:11.305 --> 00:12:13.485
or that Jesus is the lochness monster.

208
00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:16.685
So at this point, it's reasonable.

209
00:12:16.785 --> 00:12:20.005
Ask what issues are divisive enough between people

210
00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:23.245
to place them outside our Christian hug zone?

211
00:12:24.795 --> 00:12:26.685
I've had the high honor of being an elder in our church

212
00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:29.405
for 23 years, and I've had the privilege over that time,

213
00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:30.885
along with other elders

214
00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:34.045
to help train new candidates for eldership.

215
00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:36.765
One thing I've done over the years is

216
00:12:36.765 --> 00:12:41.565
to ask them this simple question, how important is

217
00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:43.125
a particular issue?

218
00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:46.845
Then, because I'm a nerd, I introduce them to

219
00:12:46.845 --> 00:12:49.365
what I call the scale of importance.

220
00:12:49.755 --> 00:12:53.405
It's a 15 point scale up here.

221
00:12:54.185 --> 00:12:58.525
The numbers in red from 15 down to just above 10 represent

222
00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:01.885
what all Christian groups everywhere in the world believe.

223
00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:05.525
If you don't believe that things from 15 down to just

224
00:13:05.525 --> 00:13:08.045
above 10, then you're either horribly misinformed

225
00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:09.365
and you need to learn the truth.

226
00:13:09.905 --> 00:13:14.405
Or if you refuse, then you really aren't a Christian at all.

227
00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:18.605
The numbers from just below 10 down to

228
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.965
one in green represent things about which Christians may

229
00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:23.005
reasonably disagree.

230
00:13:25.985 --> 00:13:27.805
So let's start with the numbers in red,

231
00:13:30.405 --> 00:13:33.365
starting at about 15 would be belief in the

232
00:13:33.365 --> 00:13:34.445
existence of God.

233
00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:36.725
You can't say you're a Christian

234
00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:38.685
and not believe in the existence of God, right?

235
00:13:39.155 --> 00:13:40.525
Somewhere between 15

236
00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:44.845
and 11 would be things like belief in the Trinity belief

237
00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:49.285
that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, belief

238
00:13:49.285 --> 00:13:53.405
that Jesus rose again from the dead Belief

239
00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:56.125
that Jesus will return to earth in a second coming,

240
00:13:57.745 --> 00:13:59.925
but starting just below 10 and going downward.

241
00:13:59.925 --> 00:14:01.525
These are things about which Christians may

242
00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:03.045
reasonably disagree.

243
00:14:04.825 --> 00:14:07.525
The higher numbers not like nine would be more

244
00:14:07.525 --> 00:14:08.845
serious disagreements.

245
00:14:10.185 --> 00:14:13.405
Now, there are three major branches in Christianity in the

246
00:14:13.405 --> 00:14:16.725
world, the Roman Catholics, the Eastern Orthodox,

247
00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:21.125
the Protestants, our church, Henderson Hills is part

248
00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:23.085
of group known as the Protestants.

249
00:14:23.915 --> 00:14:26.445
Therefore, we're gonna have major disagreements

250
00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:27.565
with the Eastern Orthodox

251
00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:30.445
and the Roman Catholics starting somewhere

252
00:14:30.445 --> 00:14:33.485
around number nine, for example,

253
00:14:33.705 --> 00:14:35.285
for our church and for Protestants.

254
00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:39.685
The main authority for our faith is the Bible.

255
00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:44.205
But for Roman Catholics in Eastern Orthodox Christians,

256
00:14:44.505 --> 00:14:47.765
the main authority for their faith is the church,

257
00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.765
including things like church councils.

258
00:14:52.145 --> 00:14:54.125
Having a different authority for your faith

259
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:57.485
causes Christian groups to come to disagreements

260
00:14:57.485 --> 00:15:00.885
with one another about their theology all the way from

261
00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:03.405
number nine, sometimes down further.

262
00:15:05.785 --> 00:15:09.085
Do these differences from just below 10 down to one make

263
00:15:09.105 --> 00:15:12.605
of the other two groups, not Christian, no.

264
00:15:13.745 --> 00:15:14.805
The Roman Catholics

265
00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:17.485
and the Eastern Orthodox are Christian brothers

266
00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:21.325
and sisters, neighbors who are just on the other side

267
00:15:21.325 --> 00:15:22.565
of a common fence from us.

268
00:15:24.145 --> 00:15:27.445
Now, I have to admit that not all members of the Roman

269
00:15:27.965 --> 00:15:30.685
Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches are Christians,

270
00:15:31.825 --> 00:15:35.205
but not all members of Protestant churches are Christians.

271
00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:37.205
I would guess that we have a number

272
00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:39.405
of people in this worship center right now

273
00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:43.405
who are not Christians because you don't become a Christian

274
00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:45.445
by attending a church or joining a church.

275
00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:48.045
You become a Christian by accepting Jesus Christ

276
00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:50.485
as your Savior and as your Lord.

277
00:15:52.145 --> 00:15:54.485
So what are some other things about which Christians might

278
00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:55.565
reasonably disagree?

279
00:15:56.765 --> 00:15:58.445
I would rate clocking in somewhere

280
00:15:58.445 --> 00:16:01.485
around Number five is a fancy theological term called

281
00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:03.965
continuation versus cessationism,

282
00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:06.725
which asks a really simple question,

283
00:16:07.985 --> 00:16:10.565
is the Holy Spirit still active in the lives

284
00:16:10.585 --> 00:16:11.725
of Christians today?

285
00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:15.285
Does he still give spiritual gifts to Christians,

286
00:16:15.315 --> 00:16:16.405
perform miracles

287
00:16:17.385 --> 00:16:20.285
or did the Holy Spirit's ministry stop in the first century

288
00:16:20.545 --> 00:16:23.365
ad our church holds

289
00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:27.045
that the Holy Spirit is still active in our lives?

290
00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:32.005
Amen. Amen. He convicts us of sin, guides us,

291
00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:33.405
gives us spiritual gifts,

292
00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:37.565
and we ask him right now to fill this room

293
00:16:37.945 --> 00:16:40.965
and lead us all closer to Jesus Christ.

294
00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.965
Issues like these cause Christians

295
00:16:44.985 --> 00:16:46.885
to form separate denominations

296
00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:49.885
and separate churches so they can practice their faith

297
00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:54.245
with like-minded brothers and sisters, and that's okay.

298
00:16:55.075 --> 00:16:57.645
It's how it should be. What are some

299
00:16:57.645 --> 00:17:00.125
of the issues on the lower end of the scale of importance

300
00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:03.485
that drives Christians apart needlessly, ridiculously.

301
00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:06.565
How about music style and worship?

302
00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:09.085
In the seventies and eighties?

303
00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:12.405
There was a kind of civil war in America over whether we

304
00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:13.645
should still sing hymns

305
00:17:13.645 --> 00:17:15.645
or we should go to contemporary Christian music.

306
00:17:15.645 --> 00:17:20.565
Get here on the radio. What about differences in preaching

307
00:17:20.565 --> 00:17:22.005
style between pastors?

308
00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:25.085
What about whether a church can go in debt

309
00:17:25.105 --> 00:17:28.525
to purchase a bigger building to move into on I 35?

310
00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:31.725
What about bitter divisions over

311
00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:33.965
what color the new carpet should be in a worship center?

312
00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:38.525
I believe these are ridiculous reasons for a church

313
00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:41.565
to fight over more toward one on the scale,

314
00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:44.045
but they're often the most common

315
00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:45.605
reasons for a church to fight.

316
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.965
In fact, our very church has grappled with some

317
00:17:49.045 --> 00:17:51.645
of these divisions over the last 60 plus years.

318
00:17:54.265 --> 00:17:56.405
The second question I've asked, being a nerd

319
00:17:56.465 --> 00:17:58.805
to ask the elders in training over the years is this,

320
00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:00.645
how do you know you're right?

321
00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:04.645
Then I introduced them to what I call the scale

322
00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:07.725
of theological certainty, which is a 10 point scale.

323
00:18:08.835 --> 00:18:09.845
This scale measures

324
00:18:10.145 --> 00:18:14.485
how much proof the Bible gives on a particular topic.

325
00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:19.325
So for example, if the topic is the existence of God,

326
00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.845
how certain are we from the Bible that God exists?

327
00:18:23.085 --> 00:18:24.605
I think it's not too much of a stretch

328
00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:27.925
that says the Bible makes a hundred percent clear

329
00:18:28.055 --> 00:18:29.685
everywhere that God exists.

330
00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:32.405
So that would be a 10 in certainty.

331
00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:34.485
What about the issue of whether

332
00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:36.205
or not Jesus rose from the dead?

333
00:18:36.395 --> 00:18:39.405
Well, that's another one that clocks in stunningly high.

334
00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:43.805
Uh, just read one Corinthians chapter 15, for example,

335
00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:47.725
but what about the issue of whether the church should sell

336
00:18:47.725 --> 00:18:49.565
some of its land to the YMCA?

337
00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.605
Where might you find principles for that in the Bible?

338
00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.605
Well, the theological certainty for that is stunningly low,

339
00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:01.645
and yet elders have to make those kinds

340
00:19:01.645 --> 00:19:03.045
of decisions all the time.

341
00:19:04.345 --> 00:19:06.405
So the reason I've introduced these two scales

342
00:19:06.405 --> 00:19:07.725
to the elder candidates

343
00:19:07.945 --> 00:19:12.885
and to us today is that it gives us perspective.

344
00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:17.965
Perspective. Over the years,

345
00:19:19.015 --> 00:19:21.445
there might be two elders in an intense debate.

346
00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:25.765
By the way, your elders debate each other all the time,

347
00:19:25.945 --> 00:19:27.565
and that's not just a good thing.

348
00:19:27.675 --> 00:19:30.525
It's a great thing. Anyway,

349
00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:32.805
two elders will get locked into an intense debate,

350
00:19:33.265 --> 00:19:35.205
and I've been known from time to time to kind

351
00:19:35.205 --> 00:19:36.245
of intrude into that.

352
00:19:36.395 --> 00:19:37.405
Stop them and ask them,

353
00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:40.645
where do you rate this topic on the scale of importance?

354
00:19:41.855 --> 00:19:44.405
Often they'll stop stare at me, stare at one another,

355
00:19:44.425 --> 00:19:46.605
and one will say a four

356
00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:49.565
and the other will say, okay, a three.

357
00:19:50.785 --> 00:19:52.605
And this point they're feeling a little sheepish

358
00:19:52.605 --> 00:19:54.285
because they've been treating the subject

359
00:19:54.315 --> 00:19:55.645
like a 10 or an 11.

360
00:19:56.835 --> 00:19:59.445
Then I've asked, now, rate this topic on your level

361
00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:00.805
of theological certainty.

362
00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:04.165
What is your proof for your position from the bible?

363
00:20:05.835 --> 00:20:08.525
They've looked even more sheepish and murdered A three

364
00:20:08.705 --> 00:20:09.885
and the other one, a two.

365
00:20:11.385 --> 00:20:14.485
The point is that all of us have a tendency

366
00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:16.565
to lose our eternal perspective,

367
00:20:17.745 --> 00:20:19.765
to fixate upon lesser issues

368
00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:23.325
and make them 1 billion points on a scale from one to 10.

369
00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:26.405
Our whole society is

370
00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:30.485
invested in making this an age of rage.

371
00:20:32.195 --> 00:20:34.485
Political parties want us to win, elect want

372
00:20:34.485 --> 00:20:37.805
to win elections by completely demonizing the other side

373
00:20:38.065 --> 00:20:40.205
and keeping members of their own party.

374
00:20:40.605 --> 00:20:45.045
Outraged. Television news channels emphasize running stories

375
00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:46.525
that enraged the viewers

376
00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.885
so the channel can get better ratings.

377
00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:54.165
YouTube specializes in videos that keep the viewers furious

378
00:20:55.075 --> 00:20:56.645
because it becomes addictive

379
00:20:57.065 --> 00:21:00.765
and millions of clicks help video makers make more money.

380
00:21:02.755 --> 00:21:05.685
Rage has become an industry.

381
00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:09.645
It has become a drug that the society is trying

382
00:21:09.645 --> 00:21:11.405
to get us addicted to.

383
00:21:12.985 --> 00:21:15.165
We live in an age of rage.

384
00:21:16.955 --> 00:21:20.005
What is one of the main reasons that we ourselves

385
00:21:20.585 --> 00:21:22.445
see fellow Christians as other?

386
00:21:24.225 --> 00:21:26.125
Why do we not live in harmony with them

387
00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:28.845
and why do we place them outside of our hug zone?

388
00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:32.525
Paul suggests here in this Romans 12 passage

389
00:21:32.675 --> 00:21:34.005
that it is simply this.

390
00:21:35.905 --> 00:21:37.445
We think we're better than they are.

391
00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:40.845
We think we're smarter than they are.

392
00:21:42.295 --> 00:21:45.645
Verse 16, live in harmony with one another.

393
00:21:47.145 --> 00:21:49.805
Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.

394
00:21:51.135 --> 00:21:56.005
Never be wise in your own sight, repay no one evil

395
00:21:56.185 --> 00:21:58.125
for evil, but give thought to do

396
00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:00.805
what is honorable in the sight of all.

397
00:22:02.585 --> 00:22:05.165
We can live in harmony with fellow Christians if we're not

398
00:22:05.475 --> 00:22:08.885
haughty, which means not prideful, not arrogant.

399
00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:13.045
The phrase associate with the lowly in the original Greek

400
00:22:13.045 --> 00:22:15.565
means to be carried away with

401
00:22:15.565 --> 00:22:18.365
that which doesn't rise far from the ground.

402
00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:23.045
In other words, we should think of ourselves

403
00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:25.845
as being the very bottom of the barrel

404
00:22:27.825 --> 00:22:29.485
as not being higher or better

405
00:22:29.585 --> 00:22:32.125
or smarter than anyone about anything.

406
00:22:33.355 --> 00:22:35.605
Apparel passage in Philippians two verse three,

407
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:37.525
states simply in humility,

408
00:22:38.135 --> 00:22:41.405
count others more significant than yourselves.

409
00:22:43.545 --> 00:22:45.045
And the last part of verse 16,

410
00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:48.525
it states very simply never be wise in your own psych,

411
00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:53.125
but in our age of rage, that's all we do.

412
00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:58.565
We're so absolutely right about politics and society

413
00:22:58.665 --> 00:23:01.445
and everything else that anyone with a different opinion,

414
00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:05.165
well, they're not just other, they're idiots.

415
00:23:07.225 --> 00:23:10.605
The next phrase is also simple. Repay no one evil for evil.

416
00:23:11.945 --> 00:23:13.965
But in our age of rage, we always feel

417
00:23:13.965 --> 00:23:16.605
that the other side started it and we're gonna finish it.

418
00:23:18.385 --> 00:23:20.365
We have to have the last word.

419
00:23:21.905 --> 00:23:24.205
Our egos wouldn't have it any other way.

420
00:23:25.865 --> 00:23:28.765
We have to show how right we are, if nothing else,

421
00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:32.645
by ridiculing and destroying those who have the audacity

422
00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:34.645
to disagree with us.

423
00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:39.205
The last phrase that Paul gives us is this,

424
00:23:39.515 --> 00:23:40.805
give thought to do.

425
00:23:40.955 --> 00:23:43.765
What is honorable in the sight of all?

426
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.285
Is that your experience in this world?

427
00:23:50.225 --> 00:23:51.925
Is that your experience on the internet?

428
00:23:53.715 --> 00:23:56.045
That in the age of rage that Christians are writing

429
00:23:56.105 --> 00:23:58.485
and saying and doing things that go out of the way

430
00:23:58.585 --> 00:24:00.205
to demonstrate honor for everyone?

431
00:24:02.415 --> 00:24:04.845
Think about the names that you wrote down are the fellow

432
00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:06.925
Christians that you're not in harmony with.

433
00:24:08.455 --> 00:24:12.205
Maybe you've hurt them or maybe they have deeply hurt you.

434
00:24:14.145 --> 00:24:17.855
Guess what? Brothers and sisters hurt each other.

435
00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:22.975
That's What they do, but they forgive each other

436
00:24:23.355 --> 00:24:24.535
and they remain a family.

437
00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:28.695
Christians should all be in one another's hug zone.

438
00:24:28.715 --> 00:24:31.775
The another me zone, even if we've gotten crisscrossed

439
00:24:31.775 --> 00:24:34.775
with one another, or even if we disagree on

440
00:24:34.775 --> 00:24:37.375
what we think are really important things,

441
00:24:39.935 --> 00:24:42.495
a center point, a center point in the division

442
00:24:42.515 --> 00:24:47.055
of our society right now spins around our current president.

443
00:24:48.605 --> 00:24:51.855
When it comes to individual policies, people seem

444
00:24:51.855 --> 00:24:55.015
to be either passionately for all of his policies

445
00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:58.495
or passionate against all of his policies.

446
00:25:00.035 --> 00:25:02.535
Now, I remember a time when people in America would often

447
00:25:02.895 --> 00:25:04.695
disagree with a policy supported

448
00:25:04.695 --> 00:25:06.735
by a president from their own political party,

449
00:25:07.275 --> 00:25:09.815
and they would often agree with a policy supported

450
00:25:09.815 --> 00:25:12.175
by a president from the opposite political party.

451
00:25:13.285 --> 00:25:16.875
Those were the days. That doesn't seem

452
00:25:16.875 --> 00:25:18.395
to be very common anymore.

453
00:25:19.695 --> 00:25:20.715
Now, whatever policy

454
00:25:20.855 --> 00:25:22.595
or issue is up for argument it

455
00:25:22.595 --> 00:25:25.675
as if it is the most important issue in the history

456
00:25:25.675 --> 00:25:29.915
of the world and the other side is ridiculously wrong.

457
00:25:31.935 --> 00:25:34.035
But how important is that issue? Really?

458
00:25:35.455 --> 00:25:38.915
People have decided not to associate with fellow Christians,

459
00:25:39.945 --> 00:25:41.555
even friends and family members

460
00:25:41.895 --> 00:25:43.595
who support one side or the other.

461
00:25:45.175 --> 00:25:47.915
But where do specific issues that divide Christian friends

462
00:25:47.935 --> 00:25:50.755
and family members fall on a scale of importance?

463
00:25:52.415 --> 00:25:55.195
Is it a 15 is the same

464
00:25:55.275 --> 00:25:57.795
as if they didn't believe in the existence of God?

465
00:25:59.695 --> 00:26:01.275
Is it the same as if they didn't believe

466
00:26:01.275 --> 00:26:03.355
that Jesus Christ rose from the dead?

467
00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:07.395
And where do our opinions rate on the scale

468
00:26:07.395 --> 00:26:08.875
of theological certainty?

469
00:26:09.975 --> 00:26:11.475
How do we know that we're so

470
00:26:12.115 --> 00:26:14.715
absolutely right about everything all the time?

471
00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:21.525
Is there overwhelming support for your opinion in the Bible?

472
00:26:22.945 --> 00:26:25.765
Or is our theological certainty on some issues more

473
00:26:25.765 --> 00:26:27.005
like a four or a three?

474
00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:31.765
If so, then why are we letting our mere opinions throw

475
00:26:31.765 --> 00:26:34.805
fellow Christians out of our hug zone?

476
00:26:37.245 --> 00:26:39.565
I know people who in every conversation are going

477
00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:43.005
to work in things which hurt and divide those around them

478
00:26:44.505 --> 00:26:45.565
and they do it on purpose.

479
00:26:46.915 --> 00:26:48.765
Well, that made for a pleasant meal.

480
00:26:48.915 --> 00:26:51.485
Well certainly wanna go back there again real soon.

481
00:26:53.085 --> 00:26:55.045
I know people who post nothing on social media,

482
00:26:55.145 --> 00:26:58.125
but gotcha political statements attacking the opposite side.

483
00:26:59.235 --> 00:27:01.205
Sometimes they even make good points.

484
00:27:02.385 --> 00:27:03.605
But even on those good points,

485
00:27:03.805 --> 00:27:06.965
I don't know if even one person on the other side is ever

486
00:27:06.995 --> 00:27:09.685
convinced it's called bias.

487
00:27:10.945 --> 00:27:13.605
And for the people that post that stuff all the time,

488
00:27:13.885 --> 00:27:15.245
I don't know if when they're posting it,

489
00:27:15.245 --> 00:27:19.725
they're very happy in their lives As a society.

490
00:27:19.725 --> 00:27:21.725
We've all fallen into the horrifying habit

491
00:27:21.745 --> 00:27:23.965
of seeing fellow Christians, even friends

492
00:27:23.985 --> 00:27:28.645
and family members, not just as other, not just as idiots,

493
00:27:29.465 --> 00:27:31.125
but as downright evil.

494
00:27:33.835 --> 00:27:34.885
What are we doing?

495
00:27:37.745 --> 00:27:40.285
We are ruining lifelong relationships.

496
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:43.525
Here's a news flash for all of us.

497
00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:48.525
Our current president is not gonna be in our daily lives in

498
00:27:48.555 --> 00:27:49.765
four short years.

499
00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:54.245
Do you know who should be in our daily lives in four short

500
00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:56.365
years, our Christian friends

501
00:27:56.465 --> 00:28:01.405
and family members, our fellow church members, when we get

502
00:28:01.405 --> 00:28:03.205
to heaven and we're hanging out with each other

503
00:28:03.305 --> 00:28:04.525
for a few billion years,

504
00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:08.125
our relationship breaking issue back on earth,

505
00:28:08.525 --> 00:28:11.325
whatever it is, is not gonna seem as important then

506
00:28:11.585 --> 00:28:15.805
as it does now, perspective.

507
00:28:17.505 --> 00:28:19.005
Now, I'm not saying that the issues

508
00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:21.485
that politics touches upon are not important at all,

509
00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:23.805
especially the moral ones,

510
00:28:24.905 --> 00:28:27.525
but even those issues aren't gonna be solved long

511
00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:28.685
term by politics.

512
00:28:30.065 --> 00:28:31.485
The Book of Revelation tells us

513
00:28:31.485 --> 00:28:34.285
that the world is headed steeply, downhill.

514
00:28:35.465 --> 00:28:38.125
We might have occasional steps backward from

515
00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:39.925
that steep downward slide,

516
00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:44.165
but the world is slowly inevitably sliding into

517
00:28:44.765 --> 00:28:46.645
deterioration and decay.

518
00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:50.205
The antichrist is coming,

519
00:28:51.705 --> 00:28:55.285
and for a time he is going to rule this world.

520
00:28:57.465 --> 00:29:01.725
To me, politics is really just rearranging deck

521
00:29:01.725 --> 00:29:03.005
chairs on the Titanic.

522
00:29:04.895 --> 00:29:07.045
There really may be a better way

523
00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.965
to do things than the nasty here and now,

524
00:29:08.965 --> 00:29:11.405
but the ship is going down either way.

525
00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:18.365
The world is more and more declining toward hell.

526
00:29:19.465 --> 00:29:21.325
And I, for one, I'm deeply disappointed

527
00:29:21.325 --> 00:29:24.605
because at this point we were all promised a hand basket.

528
00:29:31.665 --> 00:29:34.525
The problems of this world, it's violence,

529
00:29:34.715 --> 00:29:37.165
it's moral corruption, it's anti-Christian hatred

530
00:29:38.145 --> 00:29:39.885
aren't gonna be solved by politics.

531
00:29:41.635 --> 00:29:45.285
They are going to be solved by Jesus Christ, our Lord.

532
00:29:48.915 --> 00:29:52.295
The fact that the antichrist will rule the world

533
00:29:52.435 --> 00:29:53.655
is not the end of the story.

534
00:29:54.345 --> 00:29:55.495
After that dark time,

535
00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:58.095
Jesus Christ will appear in his second coming

536
00:29:58.155 --> 00:30:00.735
and he will set all things to write.

537
00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:06.255
He will reign forevermore as king of all the universe.

538
00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:11.455
Amen. An African American preacher in

539
00:30:11.455 --> 00:30:15.735
2008 famously stated, our God is not the God

540
00:30:15.735 --> 00:30:19.615
of Democrats, nor is he the God of Republicans.

541
00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:23.095
Jesus did not come to take sides.

542
00:30:24.235 --> 00:30:25.815
He came to take over.

543
00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:31.495
And when Jesus is reigning over all creation,

544
00:30:32.035 --> 00:30:34.135
we ourselves will be with him forever

545
00:30:34.595 --> 00:30:37.615
and ever in absolute paradise.

546
00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:43.655
Amen. But what of politics here in the nasty here and now?

547
00:30:43.655 --> 00:30:47.215
What of issues in this world that cause us such anxiety,

548
00:30:47.585 --> 00:30:48.735
anger, division,

549
00:30:50.385 --> 00:30:54.855
World renowned Pastor Tim Keller once stated this, if the

550
00:30:55.415 --> 00:30:59.415
resurrection is true, then everything is gonna be all right.

551
00:31:02.795 --> 00:31:05.935
We are all here in this church today to proclaim

552
00:31:06.045 --> 00:31:09.455
that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is true,

553
00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:11.815
absolutely inherently true.

554
00:31:13.405 --> 00:31:18.375
Amen. Therefore, everything is going to be all right.

555
00:31:20.555 --> 00:31:23.455
So my brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ, we have to be

556
00:31:23.595 --> 00:31:28.335
of one minding in harmony with fellow Christians, even if,

557
00:31:29.545 --> 00:31:31.375
especially if we disagree

558
00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:34.255
with him on important issues of the day.

559
00:31:36.115 --> 00:31:39.815
Now, what about the last verse in today's passage, verse 18,

560
00:31:39.915 --> 00:31:41.095
if possible, so far

561
00:31:41.095 --> 00:31:43.975
as it depends on you live peaceably with all.

562
00:31:45.355 --> 00:31:46.775
Notice that this passage needs

563
00:31:46.775 --> 00:31:48.575
to be talking about a different group of people.

564
00:31:48.795 --> 00:31:51.655
It says all. So I believe

565
00:31:51.655 --> 00:31:54.135
that Paul isn't talking here just about fellow Christians,

566
00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:58.415
but he's focusing upon the wider world of non-Christians.

567
00:31:59.865 --> 00:32:01.535
These are people outside

568
00:32:01.535 --> 00:32:03.415
of our hub zone of fellow Christians.

569
00:32:03.635 --> 00:32:06.135
But even for these people, the apostle Paul calls us

570
00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:08.175
to reach out to them.

571
00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:12.015
The second prop I want to use in my sermon

572
00:32:12.155 --> 00:32:14.295
for today is a handshake.

573
00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:18.495
If you think about it, when we extend our hands all the way

574
00:32:18.495 --> 00:32:21.175
out to the end of our arms, we're really saying to someone

575
00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:24.335
that we want to connect with them even though they're

576
00:32:24.335 --> 00:32:27.775
outside of our circle, we are reaching out to them

577
00:32:27.925 --> 00:32:30.455
with an attitude of being at peace with them.

578
00:32:31.955 --> 00:32:34.975
But do we always do this In our age of rage?

579
00:32:36.035 --> 00:32:38.575
Are we reaching out to everyone to bring them closer

580
00:32:39.115 --> 00:32:40.285
into friendship with us?

581
00:32:41.945 --> 00:32:44.205
Now, it's not always possible for us to make peace

582
00:32:44.205 --> 00:32:45.245
with everyone around us.

583
00:32:46.025 --> 00:32:47.805
We can offer our handshake to them,

584
00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:51.485
but they have to offer their hand in order for there

585
00:32:51.485 --> 00:32:52.765
to be a clasping of hands.

586
00:32:53.265 --> 00:32:56.485
We can't make them shake hands with us.

587
00:32:58.115 --> 00:33:00.765
Some Christians who have done their best to live in peace

588
00:33:00.765 --> 00:33:02.165
with someone might feel guilt

589
00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:05.605
because they feel they're the cause of rift

590
00:33:05.605 --> 00:33:06.885
between them and someone else.

591
00:33:07.425 --> 00:33:10.325
But it takes two to tango.

592
00:33:12.265 --> 00:33:14.525
Now, I'm not saying that we should let ourselves become

593
00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:17.085
victims over and over again to abusers

594
00:33:17.825 --> 00:33:19.645
who continually take advantage of us

595
00:33:19.745 --> 00:33:21.325
or who continually damage us.

596
00:33:22.385 --> 00:33:24.165
But the apostle Paul is saying here

597
00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:28.605
that it is incumbent upon us to reach out our hands

598
00:33:28.705 --> 00:33:31.805
to others to be at peace with them

599
00:33:32.555 --> 00:33:34.245
insofar as we can.

600
00:33:36.145 --> 00:33:37.725
So right now, I want everyone in the room

601
00:33:37.825 --> 00:33:40.365
to reach out your hand in a handshake of peace.

602
00:33:41.315 --> 00:33:43.685
Yeah, it's awkward, but it's no worse than the hug, right?

603
00:33:43.745 --> 00:33:45.005
So stick your hands out.

604
00:33:46.765 --> 00:33:49.845
I want you to think about the non-Christians that you know

605
00:33:49.845 --> 00:33:51.925
that you have not extended your hand

606
00:33:51.945 --> 00:33:53.445
to in a handshake of peace.

607
00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:57.445
Are there non-Christian family members, friends

608
00:33:57.545 --> 00:33:59.365
who you've written off and you will not

609
00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:00.525
extend your hand to them?

610
00:34:01.695 --> 00:34:04.485
Think through that, Okay?

611
00:34:04.825 --> 00:34:07.485
Put your hands down and write down their names.

612
00:34:09.955 --> 00:34:12.325
Hall is telling us so far as it depends on,

613
00:34:12.325 --> 00:34:13.885
you live at peace with all.

614
00:34:28.665 --> 00:34:30.565
One last thing we need to explore this morning

615
00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:31.725
is the concept of peace.

616
00:34:32.735 --> 00:34:33.925
Where does peace come from?

617
00:34:34.945 --> 00:34:38.205
The answer is that peace comes from God.

618
00:34:39.425 --> 00:34:42.165
The Bible tells us that when God made the first humans, Adam

619
00:34:42.225 --> 00:34:45.205
and Eve, that they were in perfect harmony with him

620
00:34:45.265 --> 00:34:46.965
and perfect harmony with one another.

621
00:34:47.155 --> 00:34:51.325
They were in perfect peace, but they sinned against God

622
00:34:51.345 --> 00:34:53.605
and they fell into what is called original sin.

623
00:34:54.715 --> 00:34:57.725
This means that all humanity is born into a state

624
00:34:57.865 --> 00:35:00.045
of being cut off from God.

625
00:35:01.945 --> 00:35:03.805
Romans chapter eight, verse seven tells us

626
00:35:03.805 --> 00:35:06.845
that humans in this fallen state are actually at war

627
00:35:07.235 --> 00:35:09.845
with God opposed to him

628
00:35:09.865 --> 00:35:12.485
and what he wants for us in life.

629
00:35:13.515 --> 00:35:15.805
Because we're in this state of sin

630
00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:18.405
and rebellion, we're cut off from the peace

631
00:35:18.835 --> 00:35:23.605
that flows from God to us when we are in harmony with him.

632
00:35:25.585 --> 00:35:29.925
But when we become Christians, when we accept Jesus Christ

633
00:35:29.945 --> 00:35:33.085
as Savior and as our Lord, the Holy Spirit comes

634
00:35:33.185 --> 00:35:34.605
to live inside of us.

635
00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:40.165
Galatians 5 22 states that one of the fruits

636
00:35:40.385 --> 00:35:43.085
of the Holy Spirit is peace.

637
00:35:44.825 --> 00:35:46.605
And as we walk in the Holy Spirit,

638
00:35:46.985 --> 00:35:48.645
he can grant us inner peace.

639
00:35:48.995 --> 00:35:53.405
Even when we are facing the most difficult trials this world

640
00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:55.205
has to throw at us.

641
00:35:56.835 --> 00:35:59.405
John 1427, Jesus says,

642
00:36:00.575 --> 00:36:03.005
peace I leave with you.

643
00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:09.725
My peace I give to you not as the world gives.

644
00:36:10.505 --> 00:36:14.725
Do I give to you? Let not your hearts be troubled,

645
00:36:15.635 --> 00:36:17.485
neither let them be afraid.

646
00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:21.885
One of my favorite theologians, Augustine Bishop

647
00:36:21.985 --> 00:36:24.765
of Hippo famously wrote this while speaking to God,

648
00:36:26.105 --> 00:36:30.245
our hearts are restless until they find

649
00:36:30.865 --> 00:36:33.285
our their rest in you.

650
00:36:35.055 --> 00:36:39.485
Peace. As we practice the spiritual disciplines like

651
00:36:39.485 --> 00:36:40.845
confession of sin

652
00:36:41.545 --> 00:36:45.325
and prayer, Bible study, worship, doing together today

653
00:36:45.325 --> 00:36:48.365
and so on, we walk in harmony in the

654
00:36:48.505 --> 00:36:51.885
and the Holy Spirit fills us with peace.

655
00:36:53.745 --> 00:36:57.325
The title of this sermon is Peacemaker in Matthew

656
00:36:58.075 --> 00:36:59.125
five, verse nine.

657
00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:02.365
Jesus says, blessed are the peacemakers

658
00:37:03.185 --> 00:37:05.365
for they shall be called the sons of God.

659
00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:11.445
It is that peace which the Holy Spirit infuses inside of us

660
00:37:11.755 --> 00:37:15.685
that enables us to be peacemakers, to encourage others

661
00:37:15.865 --> 00:37:17.245
to reach out to each other,

662
00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:20.845
and for we ourselves to reach out

663
00:37:20.845 --> 00:37:22.805
to non-Christians in a handshake

664
00:37:22.985 --> 00:37:25.925
and reach out to fellow Christians in a hug of harmony,

665
00:37:26.435 --> 00:37:28.605
embracing them within our inner circle,

666
00:37:29.275 --> 00:37:32.925
despite our differing opinions and our past hurts.

667
00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:38.605
I want us to imagine a world where we as a church

668
00:37:39.305 --> 00:37:42.245
are realigned straight up

669
00:37:42.245 --> 00:37:45.365
and down according to God's plumb line

670
00:37:46.305 --> 00:37:49.085
and are in harmony with one another.

671
00:37:50.595 --> 00:37:52.885
Imagine a world where we reach out.

672
00:37:54.435 --> 00:37:56.165
Imagine a world where Christians,

673
00:37:56.345 --> 00:37:58.565
all throughout this church, look at their list

674
00:37:58.565 --> 00:38:02.045
of names they wrote down and seek out those people.

675
00:38:02.155 --> 00:38:06.965
This week, they seek out those who they have cast out

676
00:38:06.965 --> 00:38:09.085
of their hug zone in their handshake zone,

677
00:38:09.385 --> 00:38:11.405
and they reconcile with them.

678
00:38:12.835 --> 00:38:16.685
Imagine friends and family members reunited in love.

679
00:38:18.275 --> 00:38:19.565
Imagine people reaching out

680
00:38:19.565 --> 00:38:22.245
to one another here in this worship center or in the lobby.

681
00:38:23.675 --> 00:38:25.725
Imagine they shake hands with one another

682
00:38:25.785 --> 00:38:28.165
or as I often do, give another a hug.

683
00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:33.165
Imagine if they say, I'm sorry that I hurt you

684
00:38:34.505 --> 00:38:36.685
or I forgive you,

685
00:38:38.065 --> 00:38:40.685
or, which would be more like our Edmond culture.

686
00:38:41.105 --> 00:38:42.645
Are you free for lunch this week?

687
00:38:44.595 --> 00:38:47.725
What would our church be like if we all sought repentance

688
00:38:48.065 --> 00:38:49.325
and harmony together?

689
00:38:50.755 --> 00:38:51.805
Imagine that world,

690
00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:57.805
and if a few minutes, the prayer team will be on the sides

691
00:38:58.305 --> 00:38:59.485
to talk with you and pray

692
00:38:59.485 --> 00:39:01.045
with you about whatever you wanna pray about.

693
00:39:01.935 --> 00:39:03.405
Maybe you wanna become a Christian

694
00:39:03.665 --> 00:39:06.845
and experience this peace of God inside you

695
00:39:07.635 --> 00:39:08.925
that passes understanding.

696
00:39:10.455 --> 00:39:13.725
Maybe you wanna pray about seeking peace with others.

697
00:39:15.445 --> 00:39:18.245
Whatever it is, our church is here for you.

698
00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:21.285
Let's close by praying together.

699
00:39:26.565 --> 00:39:31.205
Almighty God. We need your peace,

700
00:39:32.865 --> 00:39:36.765
the peace that passes understanding to flow through us.

701
00:39:38.505 --> 00:39:40.445
Please forgive us of our sins

702
00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:42.725
and wash us clean with the blood of your son

703
00:39:44.105 --> 00:39:48.525
so we can have sweet fellowship, sweet peace with you.

704
00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:52.205
And Father, we ask that you would

705
00:39:53.115 --> 00:39:55.085
have your peace flow within us

706
00:39:55.265 --> 00:39:58.445
and through us as we are walking in your Holy Spirit day

707
00:39:58.505 --> 00:40:02.445
by day so that we can be at peace with one another,

708
00:40:02.545 --> 00:40:06.125
