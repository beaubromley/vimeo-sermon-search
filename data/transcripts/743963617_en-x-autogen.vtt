00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.800
Well, good evening and welcome to disciple making

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.400
101.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
I've been nervous all week long because last week we had 207 people

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.300
come and take notebooks and people said

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.800
how do you give yourself a hand? Good job your your back. The

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.200
nervous part was how many would come back on

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.500
the next week? I said if we have 60 it was it's a

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
huge failure, but but you're here and

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.800
I don't know what the math is, but it's a pretty good showing so we're

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.600
gonna go ahead and get started last week.

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.800
I made a huge mistake. I

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.300
prepared and put in and had put

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.600
in all your notebooks a magnifying glass and the

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
purpose of the magnifying class is not to assist

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.900
the elderly with seeing the small text. All

16
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.900
right. It's a an object lesson that

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.400
says that this disciple making

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.700
vision is God's big vision. And so what

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.200
we're doing is simply putting a magnifying glass on

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.300
it so that we can see is what God has for us as a church.

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.100
And so but if it helps you see the

22
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.700
text when that's okay too, so

23
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.500
Let's get started. I want to share with you that one of the most important things that

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.100
we have to learn is about the disciple making pathway what

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.300
that means is that the things that we're already doing

26
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.200
like worship service and we have our

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.800
equipping groups and you know about those in our community groups. How many

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.900
of you just for knowledge sake

29
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.500
how many of you are already Faithfully attending a

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.400
community group. All right. So look at that. See

31
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.200
that's a great sign and I'm not surprised that you're here

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.800
Community groups are kind of the incubator for

33
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.800
relationships that could become a micro

34
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.500
groups or disciple making relationships what we're

35
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.700
going to be focusing on.

36
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.400
Is a moving people up this

37
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.900
pathway so that they could get to the sweet sweet spot

38
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.200
of discipleship, which is micro groups. Now

39
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.400
we are actually and I know

40
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.300
I sprung this on you last week, but we were actually doing

41
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.600
experiment with micro groups every Wednesday

42
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.100
night and some of you are already meeting

43
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.300
in your micro groups, you're like that. We don't really need that instruction piece for

44
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.200
going right to the group. But but this

45
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.100
is the pathway and I want us to all become familiar with it

46
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.600
because the staff is planning on working

47
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.800
at being intentional about moving people from

48
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.400
One station to the next they will

49
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.900
come initially to worship service and they'll

50
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.600
hear good preaching and good music. But that

51
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.300
is a what's odd about that. Is that

52
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.400
everybody sits where you're sitting now pointing the same direction and

53
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.200
the lights are down. It's kind of like a movie theater. It's not a

54
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.600
great spot for making relationships. So we want to go from the

55
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.300
worship service to the community.

56
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Group and again another open group, but what

57
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.200
you're going to see here is they've all

58
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.400
got a purpose, but the purpose is

59
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.800
this.

60
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.700
People can come to the large group and be

61
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.300
fairly Anonymous and frankly some people like that.

62
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.700
I'm not going to have you raise your hand because you probably wouldn't anyway, but

63
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.500
if I said how many of you prepared prefer anonymity there's

64
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.000
a lot of people who come say, you know,

65
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.200
I don't

66
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.100
I'm not ready to commit I just want to come and I just want to

67
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.200
kind of get a feel for the church. Well, that's where you come. It's

68
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.600
a precise place well-timed. The

69
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.600
the speaker is knowledgeable has

70
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.600
been studying a long time. But he's the only one who speaks

71
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.200
as a matter of fact, don't try this

72
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.300
on Sunday. But if you stand up during the sermon raise your

73
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.100
hand and ask a question the Usher will see

74
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.300
you out. Okay? That's just a warning. All right, don't try me

75
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.700
on that. All right, but at the community groups, it

76
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.300
kind of goes from common language.

77
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.100
All right to a casual and now you're the

78
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.700
you have the clarity of being able to ask a

79
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.200
follow-up question like or you have the clarity of

80
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.000
being able to answer a question or comment on

81
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.300
something that you think the Lord might be teaching you through the

82
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.300
passage, but then what happens over here in our

83
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.100
sweet spot is now we're we're

84
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.300
having to customize.

85
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.100
For example, Jesus spoke to the

86
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.600
four or five thousand at the feeding of the four 5,000

87
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400
also at the Beatitudes in the large group The also

88
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.000
spoke in the community to the disciples, but

89
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.500
then over here with his three or

90
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.700
five Peter James and John, what did he say to Peter at

91
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.400
the at the breakfast? He said Peter do

92
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.000
you love me?

93
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.400
So you see how you go from a common

94
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.000
to kind of a Clarity to now we have a customized

95
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.300
question and you'll be able to do that

96
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.300
in your micro groups other things that we'll do

97
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.500
is that we'll learn about whoops. Hang

98
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.400
on somebody's gonna teach me how to do this.

99
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.700
whoops

100
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.100
There we go. So there it is again. We're just

101
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.800
gonna change colors. How's that sound?

102
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.700
Over here we can have relationships.

103
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.000
We can have transparency.

104
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.200
Transparency would be able to say hey guys. I need you to pray

105
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.100
for me because I'm having a difficult time at work this

106
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.200
week and to explain exactly what that difficult time looks

107
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.100
like. And so that now you're being open and honest with people that

108
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.200
you can trust. So what else can we

109
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200
have we have intimacy?

110
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.300
My first discipleship group had gotten so

111
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.600
close that I could look at the eyes of

112
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.300
the person in my discipleship group and tell whether they

113
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.200
were full of the Holy Spirit or grieved with the Holy Spirit and it

114
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.700
was odd and you just could see whether they

115
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.200
were full of restlessness or whether they were

116
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.300
full of joy in peace. And that's exactly what will

117
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.400
happen as we begin to grow closer in

118
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.200
intimacy and eventually accountability.

119
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.200
And accountability is something that you may

120
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.300
have experienced this week. You might not know this. If you're a

121
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.700
participant I ask your leader to send you a personal text this

122
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.300
week just by a raise of hands. Haven't you

123
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.400
got a text from your micro group this week? All right.

124
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.800
Okay way to go. I'm proud of you guys. This is how it

125
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.200
works. Okay, so

126
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.300
So over here you as far

127
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.900
as experiences go you you're seeing.

128
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.400
Um when I come on Sunday mornings at at 9

129
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.300
o'clock, I'll walk right down this Middle Island trying to find my wife

130
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.500
and and I'm kind of like hey good to

131
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.000
see you good to see you but I never stop and say how was

132
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.300
your week this week? Right? That's really not

133
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.700
the place for that and frankly.

134
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.800
Sometimes I don't want to know how your week was right? We're not

135
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.400
there for that reason. But but over

136
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.800
here you're heard now, maybe during

137
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.400
prayer requests maybe during a question

138
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.100
and answer time people know where you are and you can

139
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.700
be a little bit more vocal about what's happening. But then over

140
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.000
here you're known.

141
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.100
And that is people can see by the

142
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.400
look on your face where you are and if there needs to be a follow-up question,

143
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400
or maybe just somebody to sit by because you're known. Okay, so

144
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.400
you see I want you to see how this continues to

145
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.700
go from common.

146
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.800
All right, which Pastor John and anybody

147
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.700
who preaches thinks? How can I share a word

148
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.700
from God's word that everyone can hear the brand

149
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.200
new Christian as well as the Christian who's been here

150
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.400
for a very long time one of

151
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.500
my very first on I first became a pastor and this

152
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.100
was back in 1989. There was a man

153
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.600
by the name of ethyl Neff and Ethel was 77

154
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.700
years old and he had been a southern baptist for over 60 years

155
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.100
and I was his 29 year old pastor.

156
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.200
And I thought to myself nothing to tell

157
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.200
this man, right? But so when you're preaching on

158
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.700
Sunday as Sunday, you've got this common language that just

159
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.000
about everybody can appreciate but then again

160
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.400
you have you can clear it up for a

161
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.500
more specific audience in your community group, but then

162
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.000
you can customize it for a specific person

163
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.300
in your micro group. So

164
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.300
hopefully what you're seeing here

165
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.300
is that

166
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.000
There there is a significant difference that

167
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.400
in fact, the rule is like this the larger the

168
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.800
crowd the harder it is to find Transparency intimacy

169
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.100
and and

170
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.700
frankly accountability and and there's

171
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.100
nothing wrong with the larger crowd because some people

172
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.800
need to come in and kind of to be anonymous and

173
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.100
they feel a little bit more willing to

174
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.200
come into a larger crowd because they know that nothing's going to be required of

175
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.000
them. How did you feel lesser? Can I said okay, we're all going

176
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.100
to get into micro group and you're like, oh

177
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.000
yelch

178
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.100
Right because because now you know, there's going to

179
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.200
be more required of you than just sitting and looking

180
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.600
in the same direction. So there's a difference and I hopefully you're seeing

181
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.700
the changes because the smaller the

182
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.200
crowd like a micro group for example or one-on-one

183
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.500
the more opportunity you

184
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.800
have for transparency intimacy and accountability.

185
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.400
And so these again this is our sweet

186
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.000
spot and this is what we're practicing and this is

187
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.300
what we're working on. I ask you to repeat after

188
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.100
me last week and I'm going to do it again. These are the essentials of

189
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.200
a good disciple making experience intentional leader.

190
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.700
You guys haven't even have to beg you and I'm so thankful relational environment.

191
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.800
And reproducible process reproducible process. So

192
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.900
what we're going to be doing.

193
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.800
In just about 10 minutes is we're

194
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.200
going to break into our micro groups some of you this is your first

195
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.300
night. And so I'm gonna have you meet me

196
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.400
down here so that I can help you find a leader and get into a

197
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.300
micro group, but we're this is

198
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.500
an experiment. This is a micro group experiment and I'm

199
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.000
going to give you a couple of discussion questions and you're going to

200
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.300
get to know people in your group and I can promise this is what's

201
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.600
going to happen.

202
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.500
Over the course of these next 14 weeks.

203
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.300
You're not going to just become more comfortable in

204
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.500
your group. You're going to become known.

205
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.200
You're going to have a customizable question that you can follow up on

206
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.000
and I can guarantee you that you're going to feel a connection to

207
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.400
that group that you did not have when you

208
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.400
first came in here. And that's just a 14 week

209
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.400
experiment when you really get into the lives

210
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.200
of one another in a genuine micro group experience and you're

211
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.400
going through what God is teaching you on a

212
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.300
daily basis in his word and you're praying for one. Another

213
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.700
with real needs. I can promise you this your

214
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.200
group will come together in ways that you

215
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.300
could not possibly imagine. I got another

216
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.100
text from Keith Skittle if you were here

217
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.300
last week Keith hit me up in the in the lobby

218
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.400
and in my last church, and he says I got some questions

219
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.200
And we met for lunch and by the end

220
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.500
of the lunch I said you need to be discipled and we started meeting

221
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.200
on Tuesday mornings and just this week Keith called me

222
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:06.700
and he says hey.

223
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.900
I like to come up there to Oklahoma and see you. He

224
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.700
said because you made such a big impact on my life. Now.

225
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.300
What he doesn't know is that I was

226
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.700
kind of in the way the Holy Spirit was doing the work right? I

227
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.800
just got to be a part of the process and everyone

228
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.900
here. If you'll believe me that God

229
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.500
wants you to experiment with being an intentional

230
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.300
leader and creating a micro group and then

231
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.300
investing your lives in that micro group in a relational

232
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.300
environment. Then I can promise you you're going to experience the

233
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.100
exact same kind of blessing because this is God's big

234
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.400
Vision. All right with that.

235
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.000
I want to show you something that happened before I got here. All right,

236
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.400
this is Henderson Hills vision statement. You guys know it it says

237
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.400
our vision is to glorify God by the coming a

238
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.300
hub for what and all ages disciple

239
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.000
making movement. So God has

240
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.700
called us to be a part of a church that

241
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.500
is a hub for an all ages disciple making

242
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.600
movement and then

243
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.300
Later, one of our values is intentional disciple

244
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.500
making what that means is we

245
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.400
share the gospel read and teach others

246
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.700
to obey Jesus commands. Now, you're going to see this theme coming

247
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.100
out in everything we talk about for the rest of the

248
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.100
night. Now the elders and Pastor John

249
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.500
worked very hard on this and gathered some people together so that

250
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.700
we could get this precisely the way we want to and look

251
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.300
what's happening here. Okay. This is not just a vision statement, but

252
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.400
now we have a definition of disciple.

253
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.600
Someone shaped by the word of God.

254
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.000
Someone Overjoyed by the gospel. Someone submitting

255
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.300
to the Holy Spirit demonstrating love to

256
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.000
others investing in God's kingdom and making disciples

257
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.600
of Jesus. So look look

258
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.500
at the person to your right to your left. Okay?

259
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.300
These are people.

260
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.800
Whom God has selected to be a part of their churches

261
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.100
vision for the future.

262
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.600
Now I gotta tell you that's pretty exciting to me.

263
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.300
I'm serious. Okay. I don't know how your job

264
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.300
went today. Mine was pretty hectic because I

265
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.200
was getting ready for a big meeting.

266
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.400
Um, but some of you you might

267
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.200
be thinking, you know, I just do the same thing every day and it's not

268
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.200
that big a deal I'm telling you right now God is calling you to

269
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.100
to something so profoundly powerful that

270
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.500
it will literally change your life and

271
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.900
the lives of those who you invest in Forever For

272
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.300
Eternity and you'll begin to

273
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.700
experience what it means to be shaped by God's word and Overjoyed by

274
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.800
the gospel and submitting to the Holy Spirit. Remember

275
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.200
a minute ago. I said I could see in the face of those

276
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.700
who I was attending whether they had grieved the Holy Spirit or

277
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.000
whether they were full of the Holy Spirit and you'll get

278
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.400
to know someone that way and someone will get to know you that way and that is the

279
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.400
place you want to be. Okay, so that's the

280
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.300
church's definition and now let's talk a little bit about the book.

281
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.800
In your folder you have

282
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.800
you don't have the book? Okay, the

283
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.300
book is called investing in a few it's written

284
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.700
by Craig Etheridge and it's a very brief read 12

285
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.200
chapters. And this week was

286
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.200
talking about the end product now in product

287
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.400
is this term that says we will

288
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.700
eventually get to a place where we have provided.

289
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.400
The end product. Well, the end product of

290
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.100
discipleship is what this chapter is about and our writer

291
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.100
says that this is men and women.

292
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.500
This is a disciples are men and women who will follow Jesus

293
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.000
and grow to be like him and carry

294
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.500
on his work.

295
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.000
So what we're going to be learning to do together in a

296
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.000
relational environment with micro group

297
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.300
of mutual people holding it one another

298
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.600
and intimate accountability. We're going to learn how to

299
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.400
be more like Jesus. We'll study

300
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.400
the word of God together individually and then

301
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.300
we'll gather together once a week or how often you

302
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.300
group your group meet decides to me and we'll discuss.

303
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.400
Okay. What? What did you learn this week in God's

304
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.500
word. And what did you like about this verse right here. What

305
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.500
did you highlight that you wanted to share in our micro group?

306
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.800
And so we will be studying God's

307
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.100
word together. So that why we will

308
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.400
grow to be like Jesus and then eventually carry on

309
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.800
his work. We'll be developing lifelong spiritual disciplines.

310
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.500
I just named four. There are more.

311
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:30.800
prayer

312
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.200
prayers like breath in and out

313
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.600
all day.

314
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.300
It's not just a breathing at the end of the day. It's breathing

315
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.300
out all day long learning how

316
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.400
to pray prayers of praise and prayers of accountability and prayers

317
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.400
of confession prayers of Thanksgiving prayers of need prayers of

318
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.400
Praise all those kinds of prayers. You'll learn how to do that within

319
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.700
the context of your micro group, but also Bible engagement

320
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.200
You will be studying God's word together individually and then

321
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.400
coming back together and Reporting what God shared with you. You say

322
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.900
well what if you didn't do your work well?

323
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.900
You'll feel the accountability of those who studied and

324
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.600
you didn't you say well that sounds awful.

325
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.400
Almost as awful is not studying God's word.

326
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.300
All right. So, I mean there's a reason why we want to do this and

327
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.900
so one of the things I love is in

328
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.300
in the micro groups that I've participated in.

329
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.200
The Holy Spirit Will Enlighten Believers to

330
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.300
see things in God's word that I might not see when they

331
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.400
share those things. Then I get to experience the joy of what they've learned

332
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.300
as has been given to them by the Holy Spirit.

333
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.500
And then I get to share what God taught me that they might not have heard

334
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.700
and so it becomes by God's design kind of

335
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.300
a cumulative effort and a communal

336
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.600
growth that they can only be appreciated in

337
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.900
a micro group community. So so Bible

338
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.100
engagement whether that's memorizing God's word

339
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.200
together studying God's word together hearing God's word.

340
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.300
You'll be able to comment on what you've heard maybe preached or in

341
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.400
a podcast and it's just it's just a wonderful place

342
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.000
to experience the engagement of God's word genuine

343
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.100
Christian Community. I don't have to share

344
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.100
with you any examples of that or lifestyle of angelism.

345
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.200
How many of you and I didn't ask this question? It's not

346
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.600
on my notes.

347
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.800
How many of you have asked a Christian brother or sister to

348
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.100
pray with you that you would have an opportunity to have

349
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.300
a gospel conversation with someone anybody ever

350
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.500
prayed say there's somebody I need to talk to like that anybody. Go

351
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.500
ahead. Yeah. See that is a perfect example.

352
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.800
Not only are you going live with

353
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.500
the opportunity for accountability. I need to

354
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.000
talk to my neighbor.

355
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.200
Pray with me that I'll have the courage and then when your neighbor

356
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.600
gets out and goes out to the mailbox, what's going to happen?

357
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.100
You like guys this is it. This is my opportunity say hey

358
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.100
what's going on? So anyway, this is

359
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.100
what we're doing. We're learning these lifelong spiritual

360
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.700
disciplines. Why?

361
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.400
This is the end product so that we would be obedient to

362
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.900
the commands of Jesus and experience full

363
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.500
participation in a community of

364
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.100
Jesus disciples. That's the end product

365
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.500
according to our author which boils us down to what I

366
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.800
believe should be our

367
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.600
simple to learn definition of what it means to be a disciple. All

368
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.300
right. What is a disciple one who is

369
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.000
following Jesus?

370
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.800
But not just following Jesus but actually being changed

371
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.300
by Jesus. This is the transformation piece. All

372
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.400
right, therefore if anyone be in

373
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.200
Christ, he is a what a new creation new creature.

374
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.500
The old is gone the newest come

375
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.400
then you read through the rest of that chapter you

376
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.300
get down to verse 21 says for he who knew no

377
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.900
sin became sin for us that we might become the righteousness of

378
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.300
God in him. We're transforming into

379
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.400
His Image, we're becoming more and more like him. We're not just following

380
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.600
him. We're being changed by him. And what is

381
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.400
the last piece of this definition and we're committed

382
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.200
to the mission of Jesus and that's disciple making

383
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.200
and that's why you're here. So this is

384
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.700
a definition that I would look for you to learn why say

385
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.600
you're not trying to try to trick us into some sort

386
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:11.700
of

387
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.100
I don't know.

388
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.900
Class Seminary class something. No. It's as

389
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.100
simple as knowing where we're going.

390
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.100
Okay.

391
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.100
I don't know these very well. So you guys are going to have to help me

392
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.700
to fail to plan

393
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.000
is to plan.

394
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.400
To fail. All right, if you don't know where you're headed, if

395
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.300
you don't know what the Target or the goal is, you'll not know when

396
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.600
you're even getting close to it. But if if you're involved

397
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.600
in a microgate group, you're Holy One Another accountable you

398
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.600
you're moving closer together. Not only intimately in

399
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.500
relationship but intimately in a relationship with Jesus, then

400
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.900
you're saying this is what it means to follow Jesus.

401
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.500
And this is what it means to be transformed or

402
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.400
Changed by Jesus and this is what it means to be committed

403
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.300
to the mission of Jesus disciple making so please learn

404
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.400
this. We'll be going over it and over

405
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.200
it. This is only our second week and you're saying oh this all like seems like

406
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.300

408
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:14.600
you.
