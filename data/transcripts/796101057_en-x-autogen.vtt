1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.500
For the grace of God offers salvation to

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.900
all people teaching us to live Godly

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.300
lives.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.200
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us and

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.900
to purify for himself a people

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.500
that are his very own.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.700
Happy Sunday to you Church. You made it through the ice

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.300
apocalypse and all the virtual school

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
and everything. Hey you made it so here. We are praise God.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.100
It's a little bit warmer as we go, but if I haven't met you

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.500
yet. If you're new, my name is John and one of the pastors here I get

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.200
to preach most of the time. I'd love to meet you sometime but we

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.000
are today continuing our series through the letter called Titus

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.300
in God's word. And so go ahead and turn there with me

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.600
in your copy or turn on your device towards

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.800
that.

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.500
Titus is the Apostle Paul's letter to his man on

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Crete named Titus.

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
That's why it's called that and so as you're turning

20
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.100
to Titus Chapter 2 verses 1 through 10, you might

21
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.200
recall. This is the same passage that we studied last

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.400
week.

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.400
And that's not a mistake.

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.200
The reason we're taking two weeks in this passage is because

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.300
it speaks to men and to women differently and

26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
separately it kind of bounces back and

27
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.000
forth a little bit.

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
And last week we looked at Paul's instructions for men.

29
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200
And this week will be more toward women.

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
Now there's gonna be a lot of parallels a lot of similarities. You'll see even in

31
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.000
the structure of the sermon today compared to

32
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.600
last week. And even the main point as a whole is virtually the

33
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.700
same.

34
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.800
If you walk away remembering nothing else remember that Godly Womanhood

35
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.100
is different than worldly Womanhood.

36
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.200
The world puts on some kind of picture of what

37
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.600
women should be but Godly Womanhood is different than

38
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.500
worldly Womanhood.

39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.100
Because remember this was in Crete this scene

40
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.400
was was there that this world was

41
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.700
like it was there and in contrast

42
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.800
to those cretans who were always liars

43
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.400
and evil beasts and lazy gluttons. That's what

44
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.500
it says in chapter one about them in contrast to that. What

45
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.800
does God say a Godly woman looks like

46
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
acts like

47
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.400
What is she?

48
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.700
Titus 2 1 through 10 will show us

49
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.900
now again, I'm speaking primarily to women today.

50
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.200
Speaking to girls who want to be women someday as

51
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.000
well and so men. How do you listen to this? How should you listen? Should

52
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.600
you just check out immediately? No.

53
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.300
Because here's the truth. I'm going to speak to you a number

54
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.500
of times as well today.

55
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.000
But also husbands, let me talk to you for a second

56
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.800
specifically.

57
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.600
You should not use any verse you

58
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.200
find here as a gotcha verse to your

59
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.500
wife.

60
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.400
That's not going to go. Well, let me just tell you that right now about anything,

61
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.500
but let alone what you'll see here.

62
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.200
So be careful with that if you're not married, let's look

63
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.300
at this as if you want to be married someday as

64
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.100
kind of the character qualities of the woman you should be looking for.

65
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.200
Or if you don't want to be married or just for any of us in general,

66
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.300
these are things that we should encourage in all women in our lives, encourage

67
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.800
and support them towards these things.

68
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.000
And so the gist of that is that we all need to listen humbly today.

69
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.200
We all need to come to this with open hands and and not

70
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.400
pointing fingers to other people but realizing that

71
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.600
in this if there's any issue, it's first and foremost my

72
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.800
own problem your own problem rather than anybody else's issue.

73
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.300
We need to deal with the Lord in our

74
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.200
hearts first and foremost. So let's come

75
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.100
to that to his word allowing him to do his work in that

76
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.300
so look at Titus 2 verses 1 through 10

77
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.800
the whole thing again.

78
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.500
But as for you now remember this was in contrast to

79
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.400
the false teachers in chapter one Paul says to Titus as

80
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.800
for you.

81
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.000
Teach what Accords with sound or healthy Doctrine?

82
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.500
Older men are to be sober-minded dignified self-controlled

83
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.900
sound and faith in love and steadfastness.

84
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.300
Older women likewise are to be reverent in Behavior not

85
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.200
slanderers or slaves to

86
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.600
much wine. They are to teach what is good? And so

87
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.800
train the young women to love their husbands and children to

88
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.600
be self-controlled pure working at

89
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.100
home kind submissive to

90
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.500
their own husbands that the word of God may not be reviled.

91
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.400
Likewise urge the younger men to be self-controlled.

92
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.600
Show Yourself Titus this is specifically to him show yourself in

93
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.500
all respects to be a model of good works in your

94
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.400
teaching show Integrity dignity and sound speech

95
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.300
that cannot be condemned so that an opponent

96
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.100
may be put to shame having nothing evil to say about us.

97
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.600
Bond servants are to be submissive to their own masters and

98
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.500
everything. They are to be well pleasing not argumentative not

99
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.600
pilfering or stealing.

100
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.100
But showing all good faith, so that in

101
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.500
everything.

102
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.600
They may Adorn the doctrine of God our

103
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.300
savior.

104
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.900
God we thank you for your word.

105
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.700
We thank you that we have it from you as what

106
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.800
you wanted us to know.

107
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.200
Wanted us to see and believe and obey.

108
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.400
So make us good soil today.

109
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.500
Make our hearts receptive.

110
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.700
Our eyes open to see what you want us to see and challenge us.

111
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800
But encourage us.

112
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.400
And holy spirit Empower us to live these things

113
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.300
out for your glory for our good.

114
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.700
In Jesus Authority we pray.

115
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.000
amen

116
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.900
So this was the kind of lifestyle that reflected

117
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.100
healthy Doctrine as verse one

118
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.300
said because it was a corrective to the false teachers in

119
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.400
chapter one who are saying these kinds of things. Paul says no.

120
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.300
No here is what healthy manhood and Womanhood

121
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.600
looks like

122
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.200
Increte as they were opposed to that as

123
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.600
they were different than the world here is what healthy manhood

124
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.500
and Womanhood ought to be for the cretan

125
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.800
Believers.

126
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.700
So we're going to see today what healthy Womanhood look like for them of course,

127
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.100
but it's it's also going to be applied today. We're gonna be

128
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.400
able to pull this forward and say Here's what this looks like in our

129
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.600
day and age that will be just as different than it

130
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.300
as it was back then.

131
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.300
So we see lists of character qualities here for older

132
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.000
women and younger women that's versus three through five and just

133
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.600
like we saw for the men there were differences in the list.

134
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.500
Said to older men these things and younger men these things and older

135
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.200
women and young woman some differences there. But but notice what it says

136
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.400
here that older women are to train the younger

137
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.900
women to do these things.

138
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.500
Which implies then think about that if the older women are

139
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.100
training younger, that means they already know how to do that.

140
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.100
So the nature of both lists then

141
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.600
is that all women should be striving to live both

142
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.400
lists out.

143
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300
Because this is what you're going to grow into younger women.

144
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.500
This is what you need to be striving for eventually, but this is just the

145
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.200
picture of all of this together. So look again

146
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.800
at verses 3 through 5 specifically to the women.

147
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.800
Older women are to be reverent in Behavior not

148
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.000
Slanders or slaves to much wine. They are

149
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.200
to teach what is good? And so train the

150
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.100
young women to love their husbands and children to be self-controlled pure

151
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.800
working at home kind and submissive

152
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.400
to their own husbands that the word of God may not

153
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400
be reviled.

154
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.000
Now if you remember last week, I categorized the Min lists

155
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.400
into three words. This was a little tougher to

156
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.200
do the same kind of thing here a little more diversity in

157
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.000
what he says, but I worked hard to get it into four words of

158
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.200
Godly Womanhood.

159
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.100
These are the things that diverse three ends with saying these things

160
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.100
are good. And these are the things that they ought to teach

161
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.300
to the younger women.

162
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.600
So this is the list first we would see a healthy woman

163
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.200
is Holy.

164
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.200
That's the first word. We would see here a healthy woman is Holy.

165
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.400
Now typically when we hear that word, holy our

166
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.400
mind goes to the idea of the word pure in

167
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.100
in the middle of verse 5 where there's some kind

168
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.500
of moral quality of behavior. That's Godly.

169
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.300
That's what we think when we think holy now, that's partly true.

170
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.300
But when you add in the first phrase of

171
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.100
verse 3 says reverent in Behavior.

172
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.800
That adds a whole other dimension to this idea of holy

173
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.300
because that word reverent brings with it the idea

174
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.600
of something that fits as being sacred to

175
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:44.700
God.

176
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.100
That a woman's lifestyle is to be

177
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.500
pointed to the Lord to be set apart in a unique

178
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.900
way for him.

179
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.800
Here's where we get that idea. The idea comes from the way that priests

180
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800
in the Old Testament would have been going into the temple.

181
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.300
Just imagine that right how they would have entered the

182
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.300
temple. Well would it have been like they were they were

183
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.200
kind of sleepy and half there and kind of loose going in there.

184
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.500
No, they wouldn't have been doing that.

185
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.400
Or they walk in there and they're all kind of high five in

186
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.500
each other and celebrate bouncing off the walls as they go into the temple. No.

187
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400
There was a reverence.

188
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.600
As they entered the temple.

189
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.900
That's what that word means is is set apart

190
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.300
in the way that you're acting. That's what

191
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.300
a Godly woman it says is to be

192
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.000
Holy.

193
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.500
To live a lifestyle that matches what she believes

194
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.000
about Jesus.

195
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.300
And and one that respects him as king one

196
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.800
that respects what he's worth and saying, okay, that

197
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.300
means he's in charge.

198
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.400
It's reverence.

199
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.700
Holy.

200
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.800
Second category of healthy Womanhood. She's self-controlled.

201
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.600
It says very clearly that she is self-controlled.

202
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.000
Now obviously this was a problem on Crete because if

203
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.400
you remember he says it about older men, he

204
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.600
says at about younger men. He says it about women here. He

205
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.100
says it as a qualification for elders in

206
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.300
chapter one verse 8, so clearly Crete was out of

207
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:20.700
control.

208
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.200
So godly people should be self-controlled.

209
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.600
But notice the specific elements here he mentions

210
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.300
for women.

211
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.900
He says that they control their tongue. They're not slanderers.

212
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.200
Now we don't use slander very often. It's a legal term in some

213
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.100
ways, but that word originally in the Greek language is diabolos.

214
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.800
Which is translated devil elsewhere?

215
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.600
So did you catch what that's meaning?

216
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.400
It means that when you slander you are being a tool

217
00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.200
of the devil.

218
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.500
Gossip is a massive deal.

219
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.400
I mean just listen to how James talks about this in James

220
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.300
chapter 3 verses 5 and 6. He says the tongue is

221
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.600
a small member yet. It boasts of great things how great

222
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.000
a forest is set Ablaze by such a

223
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.000
small fire.

224
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.600
The tongue is a fire a world of unrighteousness. The

225
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.600
tongue is said among our members staining the whole body

226
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.300
setting on fire the entire course of life

227
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.400
and set on fire by hell.

228
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.700
What he says is that gossip is like a spark.

229
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.400
That the enemy dumps gasoline on

230
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.900
and it destroys the entire for us.

231
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.700
It's been said that nothing destroys a church faster than gossip.

232
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.700
Because it spreads like wildfire.

233
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.600
Godly women should not be that way.

234
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.300
Man, of course to as gossip is universal, but

235
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.700
this says Godly women should not be that way because

236
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.400
look at continues in verses 7 through

237
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.500
12 in James 3 says every kind of Beast and bird reptile sea

238
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.500
creature Can Be Tamed has been tamed by mankind, but

239
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.000
no human being can tame the tongue.

240
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.200
It's a Restless evil full of deadly poison with it.

241
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.100
We bless our Lord and father with it. We curse people who are

242
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.000
made in the likeness of God.

243
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.700
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing my brothers

244
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.300
meaning brothers and sisters the church these things

245
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.600
ought not to be so.

246
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.800
Does a spring poor force from the same opening both fresh and salt

247
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.000
water?

248
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.900
Can a fig tree bear of olives?

249
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.400
a grapevine produce figs

250
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.300
neither can assault Pond yield fresh water.

251
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.300
So what he's meaning there, is that that if you've

252
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.300
been made a new creation in Christ.

253
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.300
If if you've become a believer in Jesus and

254
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.500
he's put a new spring of water inside you the Living Water that

255
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.400
he gives if he's put that spring inside of

256
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.900
you then salt water should not come out of your mouth.

257
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.400
Right. That's what he's saying is that this was the way of cretan

258
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.200
liars was to spew slander

259
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.800
all over the place.

260
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.100
Godly women should not be that way.

261
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.500
It's not for Christians if we have new spring water

262
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.500
in us. That's what should come out instead of

263
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.100
any kind of salt water.

264
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.300
So that's one way self-control shows up. The other way. He says

265
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.800
is that they are not a slave to much wine verse

266
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.300
3 says

267
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.400
so apparently the moms of Crete loved their wine Wednesday a

268
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:49.900
little too much.

269
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.300
And so Godly women were to stand out.

270
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.500
In not being enslaved to alcohol.

271
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.000
In not trying to numb some emotional whole.

272
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.000
with wine or alcohol

273
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.900
which by the way men are susceptible to that just as much.

274
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.200
But that was something that was starkly showing up

275
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.500
in Crete.

276
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.200
So he says Godly women be different.

277
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.700
But I want you to remember something we talked about this a lot last week about self-control in

278
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:27.700
general.

279
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.100
When we say self-control.

280
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.500
We're not talking about like trying harder and and white

281
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.400
knuckling it and doubling down and trying to

282
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.600
control things yourself.

283
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.100
What we're talking about here is opening your

284
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.500
hands and releasing control of even

285
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.300
your Temptations your life so that

286
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.600
he can give you new self-control remember.

287
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.800
He's made you New Creation. So give him control and

288
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.500
new self-control means he is in control.

289
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.000
Not you.

290
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.700
It's about leaning on the good news of jesus'

291
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.100
Life Death and Resurrection in your place.

292
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.400
To help you overcome those Temptations to know that they're going to come and

293
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.800
and he's already defeated those. He's already done it. Let

294
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.100
him fight that battle.

295
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.300
As you release the control to him.

296
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.400
So a healthy woman is

297
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.900
holy self-controlled

298
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.400
third she is kind.

299
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.500
She's kind.

300
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.700
You saw that word very clearly in the middle of verse 5.

301
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.900
Again, this is a picture that is opposed to the cretan

302
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.600
evil beasts. Remember?

303
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.200
This is how the women of Crete were they were

304
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.800
evil beasts.

305
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.300
So Godly women should be kind.

306
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.800
gracious

307
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.400
Godly women should not be on the next episode of Mean Girls, right?

308
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.000
Like that's not what we should be about.

309
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.100
Kathy Evans, our receptionist in the office is a

310
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.000
great example of kindness.

311
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.500
Of what it means to bring true beauty into

312
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.300
any situation.

313
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.500
A great example of what First Peter chapter 3 describes

314
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.200
in verses 3 and 4 says do

315
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.400
not let your adorning be external.

316
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.300
The breeding of hair and putting out of gold jewelry clothing you wear

317
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.800
let your adorning your beauty be the hidden

318
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.000
person of the heart.

319
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.300
With the imperishable beauty of a gentle

320
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.100
and quiet Spirit, which in God's sight is very

321
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.500
precious.

322
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.500
This is someone who just exudes calm,

323
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.600
right?

324
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.500
And they bring Beauty in any situation because

325
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.100
it just flows out of them. It's from the inside out.

326
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.300
Like this is someone a healthy woman is

327
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.800
someone who's kind who's benevolently blessing

328
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.600
everyone around you with. Peace.

329
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.600
Do you bring chaos or do you bring peace?

330
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:13.900
kindness

331
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.200
is what we should be.

332
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.100
There's a fourth category here.

333
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.200
a healthy woman is loving

334
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.900
a healthy woman is loving

335
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.700
Now this one encompasses a lot of this section here, but it's primarily

336
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.300
what we see in Verses 4 and 5. It says love their

337
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.800
husbands and children working at home and submissive to

338
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.200
their own husbands.

339
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.100
Do you feel the air of the room suck out right there? As I said that one?

340
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.600
Everybody's kind of like holding their breath. Like how's he gonna handle this? Oh boy.

341
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.000
Okay, so just check it out. Okay, here's what I want

342
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.100
to do. I want to First go back.

343
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.000
To exactly what I said last week.

344
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.200
Because if you remember loving was also on the list for men.

345
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.300
Men are to be loving as well and the word used in

346
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.400
verse 2 is the word Agape, which is that self-sacrificial love

347
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.300
that Jesus has for us that we are to be

348
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.700
doing for all people across the

349
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.100
board women men. We are to be loving

350
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.500
right our neighbors our families people.

351
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.800
We don't know our enemies strangers. That's all encompassed in

352
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:23.800
that.

353
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.300
But here there's an additional element to that

354
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.300
because the words that are used here for love their husband

355
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.300
and love their children occur. Only here in the New Testament.

356
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.400
It's almost like Paul makes up words to try to explain what

357
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.900
he's communicating here that this is a very specific kind

358
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.400
of love one that's pointed to your husband and

359
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.100
pointed to your children.

360
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.400
Because the context here in Titus in Crete was that the

361
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.000
vast majority of young women were married at a very

362
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:56.600
young age.

363
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.700
And they lived in that world.

364
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.700
And so he's talking to that culture and he's

365
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.700
saying to them that yes, I'm not using the word Agape

366
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.800
but hear me say the same concept.

367
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.900
Because he doesn't say just in a vacuum.

368
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.500
Love your husband, right? He doesn't say it in

369
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.700
a vacuum. He says with the other things involved.

370
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.500
He says working at home. He says submissive their

371
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.500
own husbands all that together with those words. He

372
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.800
made up gets to the Agape idea.

373
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.400
And so we're going to take a look at how that is. True.

374
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.200
Agape kind of love.

375
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.800
by looking at these often confusing phrases

376
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.300
We need some clarity. So I want to explain a little bit about what we

377
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.300
see here.

378
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.400
So the first phrase is this idea of working at

379
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:52.700
home.

380
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.200
So when you look at that in the original language, it literally means

381
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.100
carrying for your home.

382
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.600
Meaning that the home is taken care of the children are safe and

383
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.900
all of that as it goes into it.

384
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.200
It doesn't mean work at home.

385
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.400
Like you can't ever leave the house.

386
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.300
You can't work outside the home as well. Because if

387
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.300
we say that then we're we're cutting out much of

388
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.300
the Bible where proverbs 31 talks

389
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.300
about job and working and selling and Lydia and Priscilla and

390
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.300
all these others that you can find. Like they have jobs like so so

391
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.000
we're not saying you can't do that. It just means

392
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.300
apparently increte.

393
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.500
There were a whole lot of women who were neglecting their

394
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.800
responsibilities at home.

395
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.500
Like they were living it up. They were doing their thing. They were going out

396
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.200
and doing it all.

397
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.400
to the neglect

398
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.900
of their primary responsibility

399
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.600
And so whatever you believe about having a job like we can differ on those

400
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.700
things, but women listen, you must prioritize your kids

401
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.700
and your home.

402
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.600
I fear that that this idea of keeping up with the Joneses

403
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.300
in our culture.

404
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.400
Has driven our decisions rather than God's word driven our

405
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:11.800
decisions.

406
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.300
And listen, I get it. There are circumstances out there that I can't possibly

407
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.200
cover. It's going to look different for people

408
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.100
and we have single moms disabled men. I get there's all kinds of

409
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.900
things here.

410
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.500
But that's where the church must step in and help.

411
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.600
Because listen, no one else can be mom.

412
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.800
No one else can.

413
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.700
That's your responsibility.

414
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.200
But in a similar way, let me let me flip this for a second.

415
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.100
Talk to you men.

416
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.700
If you are effectively absent from your kids'

417
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.200
lives in the name of providing for them.

418
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.500
What are you doing?

419
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.100
You're doing the same thing.

420
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.000
Listen, I know there's circumstances there, too. We can't

421
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.300
get to all of those, but just think about this for a second that maybe

422
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.400
maybe you need to take a lesser position that demands

423
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.500
Less hours, or maybe you need to move your family to a

424
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.300
smaller house that you can afford with less work so that you

425
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.300
can be involved in your kids' lives.

426
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.300
Don't use the excuse of providing and it's

427
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.100
it's some unreal standard that you're trying to

428
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.600
provide for.

429
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.300
Don't make this conversation just about whether women

430
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.600
can work outside the home or not.

431
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.700
Let's all stop and consider for

432
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.500
a second. Do we value the home

433
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.900
like God values the home?

434
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.200
Right that it let's let's set that aside for a second and make

435
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.500
the priority what God makes the priority here.

436
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.400
That this this home environment is

437
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.700
the primary disciple making tool for your own kids'

438
00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:57.900
lives.

439
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.900
And you can do that whether you make a lot of money or make no money.

440
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.700
And so working at home. I hope you consider a

441
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.400
little bit about that. That's some clarity there,

442
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:11.800
but then

443
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.200
Along with that. We have the famous submissive to

444
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.500
their own husband's line in verse 5.

445
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.500
Now this one is often misunderstood and often misused. And

446
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.300
so we need some clarity on this.

447
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.700
First you need to read it carefully notice it

448
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.600
is to their own husbands.

449
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.500
Not submit to all husbands all men. It's a

450
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.600
specific context.

451
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.400
Yet even in that. I know there's some women who?

452
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.900
Felt that that makes them a doormat or takes away

453
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.600
their voice.

454
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.700
And so they resist that very strongly.

455
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.100
Part of that is because there have been some men husbands who

456
00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.200
have made their wife a doormat and have

457
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.800
taken away their voice and that's wrong.

458
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.400
And so what do we do? We come to this position here of like how

459
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.400
do we handle this? What we we let scripture interpret scripture.

460
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.500
Ephesians chapter 5 verses 22 through 33 helps

461
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.200
us understand this passage. There's

462
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.300
there's the fullest and best explanation of submission in

463
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.100
the marriage context in that Passage.

464
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.100
But here's a key that we often miss.

465
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.300
When we look at that section, we often take 22 to 33

466
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.500
and Mark that off and that's about marriage. And yes.

467
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.300
But we can't miss verse 21 which is right

468
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.000
before it.

469
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.000
because 21 says this

470
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.500
submitting to one another out of reverence for

471
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:48.900
Christ.

472
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.500
So Paul's talking to the Ephesian church, and he's

473
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.000
saying this is how this thing works as Christians you all are

474
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.100
to give thanks a dress each other

475
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.700
in Psalms here all that all the stuff. He says before that submitting to

476
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.300
one another

477
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.700
out of reverence for Christ

478
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.200
It's a mutuality.

479
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.400
in the church

480
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.200
in essence That's the basis of Christianity though, isn't

481
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.200
it?

482
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.000
See Christianity is not some elevation of

483
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.400
self.

484
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.500
Like I'm just trying to climb a ladder and I'm trying to get more for me me

485
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.400
me no Christianity. The essence of it is

486
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.000
a dying to self.

487
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.300
It's trying to go down the ladder as much as

488
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.700
possible rather than climb some ladder.

489
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.100
Because that's what Jesus did.

490
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.500
This is universally true men women any age

491
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.500
it's universally true. We are called to die

492
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.400
to ourselves all of us.

493
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.900
and that verse

494
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.600
verse 21

495
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.300
Is the setup for verse 22?

496
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.700
Because here's what's interesting when you actually read this in the original language. It

497
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.400
reads like this.

498
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.200
So verse 21 submitting to one another out

499
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.700
of reverence for Christ verse 22 wives to

500
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.400
your own husbands.

501
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.300
Like the verb that we put in here in English is absent.

502
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.400
We have to write it in there. So it's like not hard to

503
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.400
read. It's like oh, so that's what that means.

504
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.300
But what Paul is saying there he's saying okay submit to

505
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.100
one another all of you. Here's one way it works

506
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:31.300
out.

507
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.400
It's in the context of a husband and a wife.

508
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.000
And so yes, the ultimate point of marriage is that it points to

509
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.500
the gospel?

510
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.200
It better than anything else in our lives in our world.

511
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.500
The husband wife relationship points to Christ in

512
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.400
the church. That is the absolute best picture of the Gospel we

513
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.100
can have

514
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.300
And that's what Ephesians 5 is teaching but

515
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.300
at the same time the application of

516
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.500
that shows up that there are the distinct roles

517
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.900
of a husband and a wife within a marriage.

518
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.500
It doesn't say anything about the value like there's

519
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.300
no difference in value between a husband and a wife. It

520
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.100
just says that there's a dance here and we got to figure out who's leading this thing.

521
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.100
You're you're coming together two separate people now becoming one

522
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.300
flesh. And how is that going to work out? That's what Paul's explaining here.

523
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.200
And again, I know right now there's questions in your mind like

524
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.100
but what about how does this yes, I know.

525
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.800
But I want to set that aside for a second just see past

526
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.800
like those questions because Ephesians

527
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.000
5 doesn't stop at verse 24.

528
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.400
Verse 24 22 through 24 is all about like wives

529
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.300
and how that works out submission those kind of things because if he stopped

530
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.800
at 24 that sound harsh.

531
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.500
Wives do this this this this okay moving on like no,

532
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.200
he doesn't stop there. Here's how

533
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.800
it continues.

534
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.400
verses 25 through 30

535
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.800
husbands

536
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.700
Love your wives Agape your wives

537
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.600
as Christ Agape the church and gave

538
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.900
himself up for her that he might sanctify her

539
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.200
having cleansed her by the washing of water with

540
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.900
the word so that he might present the church to himself and Splendor

541
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.700
without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she

542
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.400
might be. Holy without blemish in the

543
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.600
same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He

544
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.400
who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated

545
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.300
his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes. It

546
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.500
just as Christ does the church

547
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.400
because we are members of his body.

548
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.400
So yes, I'm speaking primarily to women in this

549
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.100
sermon, but

550
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.500
A man listen up for a second.

551
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.800
It is a high calling.

552
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.400
For a woman to follow the loving leadership of

553
00:28:59.400 --> 00:28:59.700
her husband.

554
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.100
It demands faith.

555
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.500
In God by trusting you.

556
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.500
So you better be a man worthy of being followed.

557
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.500
If we're gonna if God's gonna ask that woman

558
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.300
to follow your leadership, you better be

559
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.100
worth it to follow.

560
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.600
That's what we're calling you to that's what scripture is

561
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.100
calling you to did you see how you are

562
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.700
to love her?

563
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.400
You are to love her like Christ loves the church. How did Christ love

564
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.200
the church he died for her.

565
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.300
He gave up his preferences he gave up his Comforts he

566
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.000
gave up his life for the good of his bride.

567
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.600
And so I know women you're hearing this you're saying okay I have

568
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.300
to die to myself to do what God's calling me

569
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.300
to do here in Titus to absolutely you do but listen

570
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.100
guys you need to die to yourself, too.

571
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.700
Right. This is the where the mutuality comes in to

572
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.500
play that you are clearly called to lead. Absolutely, but

573
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.400
that does not give you a right to be a dictator.

574
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.400
You are dying to yourself. You're giving your life away for her. She's giving

575
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.400
her life away for you. That's how this works best.

576
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.400
I spent some time this week reviewing this sermon with Beth who's

577
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.100
our women's ministry director just to kind of walk through where

578
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.600
I was going with it and she had a good suggestion. She said I

579
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.200
should ask my wife Emily what her perspective is

580
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:32.900
on submission.

581
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.600
What does it look like for us in our home?

582
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.100
And since my wife is way more comfortable not on the

583
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.500
stage up here with me. I asked her to write something for us.

584
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.700
So here's what she wrote about that. What does

585
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.500
it look like for us?

586
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.700
She says husbands need to be respectable trustworthy and

587
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.500
Godly men who seek the Lord in all things.

588
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.500
Knowing I'm married to a man like this makes all the difference.

589
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.500
As time goes on my trust in him increases and

590
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.800
makes following his leadership easier.

591
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.500
Even as I feel comfortable humbly sharing

592
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.400
my opinion as we discuss decisions.

593
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.200
To me submission means respecting him as the

594
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.800
one who ultimately answers to God for our family.

595
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.300
It's allowing him to lead as we disciple and

596
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:26.900
train the boys.

597
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.800
Following his guidance with financial decisions and me

598
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.200
keeping the house and schedules as in order as we

599
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.300
can so that he can fully focus on the calling God has

600
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.100
on his life.

601
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.500
We have mutually agreed upon our roles and what works best

602
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.400
for our family.

603
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.700
Yet John will also Lead Me by serving through doing

604
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.500
the dishes laundry and cooking without me

605
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:51.800
asking.

606
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.500
putting my needs before his

607
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.900
as I do with him, too.

608
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.900
As we both live as God ordains, it

609
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.500
brings order to our house and is truly

610
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.200
a blessing.

611
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.500
By the way the whole time I was writing this sermon. I had my wife Emily in

612
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.800
my mind like just describing her.

613
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.000
Incredible Gift

614
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.700
but hopefully even in that.

615
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.000
As we looked at the scriptures, you see that part of what it means

616
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.300
to be a Godly woman is to be loving.

617
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.500
Again, if you're married and have kids that's what it looks like. If you're

618
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.400
not you see what love is it's about being sacrificed willingly

619
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.300
self-sacrificing for the good of

620
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.200
another even when they don't deserve it and even when they can never pay you

621
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.200
back.

622
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.500
Now I want to be careful don't hear me say that that means

623
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.200
a woman is supposed to take abuse and just deal with it and

624
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.200
stay no you can leave the house and you can get help and

625
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.300
you can call him to account but the point of this in a

626
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.500
Godly home is that the verse five

627
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.900
the word of God may not be reviled.

628
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.700
that we as Christians should live

629
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.100
in such a way that people look at this and say

630
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.500
you guys really do believe that stuff, don't you?

631
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.600
That really does make a big impact in your life. It

632
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.500
does change you doesn't

633
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.500
That's the goal.

634
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.300
to give people a picture what a transformed woman looks like

635
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.700
because when you think about Crete

636
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.300
there were not a lot of good pictures of what a transform woman

637
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:29.800
was to be.

638
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.200
Right, they're coming into this from Evil Beast. Lazy gluttons, right?

639
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:34.900
That's what they know.

640
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.700
So anyone who came to Christ was then supposed to

641
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.700
equip other women for it.

642
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.200
Like this was the challenge Paul couldn't do it. Titus couldn't

643
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.200
really do it. He needed women to do this. That's the

644
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.500
end of verse 3 the beginning of verse 4 teach. What is good and

645
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.400
train the young women?

646
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.300
That word brings with the idea of equipping someone to do

647
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.400
it. They don't know how to do it on their own. It's not natural to them to do

648
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.100
these things. So they've got to be trained how to do it.

649
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.400
That's what Emily received when she was a high school. She spent

650
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.200
a ton of time at the pastor's wife with her and

651
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.300
at their house and she was trained how to be a

652
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:13.700
Godly woman.

653
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.900
How do you best train someone to do it's not through a lecture showing them

654
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.300
a video series? It's not through and it's they're doing

655
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.300
it alongside them.

656
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.500
They watch you they see you. You challenge them.

657
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.200
That's what we're talking about. We say disciple making around

658
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:30.700
here all the time.

659
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.700
We're talking about this not just teaching Matthew 28

660
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.100
says teaching to obey all of

661
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.200
Jesus's commands. How do you do that? You challenge you it takes

662
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.000
it takes reps. It takes practice you challenge and equip them

663
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.900
to do what they need to do.

664
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:48.700
So women

665
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.000
be disciple makers.

666
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.400
We need you to be disciple makers older

667
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.300
women, especially you might feel like man. My life is pointless now.

668
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.100
My kids are out of the house. I'm single now or whatever.

669
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.000
It is like you I'm what do I do now?

670
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.400
You have an essential role?

671
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.800
within the church

672
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.300
We need you to disciple younger women who might not

673
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.600
have had a good example of what it means to be a Godly woman. Let

674
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.100
them see you do it bring them

675
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.000
into your life in a world that pushes everything else at

676
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.300
them.

677
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.300
They need to see Godly women teach. What

678
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.300
aligns with God's word what aligns with

679
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.100
with what he wants to be wants us to be about I

680
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.800
mean who else is going to do it?

681
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.400
Tiktok Fifty Shades like who's who's gonna teach the young

682
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.100
women? Not that Godly women are to teach

683
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.500
younger women

684
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.900
because this kind of Godly lifestyle is not just Theory.

685
00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.300
This is to be lived out in Daily Life. We're not just talking

686
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.000
about a book. We're talking about daily life lived

687
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.800
out in front of other people.

688
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.300
in every context remember the end of verses 9 and 10

689
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.400
where Paul talks about Bond servants slaves in some

690
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:08.500
ways.

691
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.600
And he says there to live a holy lifestyle as they

692
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.600
submitted to their masters. That's that context of submission Authority,

693
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.800
right? So so why were they to live like that?

694
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.400
The end of verse 10 says here's why you live

695
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.600
a life like this in front of other people verse 10 so that

696
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.500
in everything they may Adorn the doctrine of

697
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.200
God our savior.

698
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.100
It's so that people see that if it

699
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.800
can change a woman's life in that kind of situation who's

700
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.200
a slave and he's kind of like if she can be

701
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.400
different show good faith in that then

702
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.700
certainly the gospel power unto salvation looks

703
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.500
more beautiful.

704
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.400
if it can make you new

705
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.300
it adorns the doctrine of God our savior.

706
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.600
And so women today.

707
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:01.800
consider

708
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.600
are you pursuing?

709
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.400
God's vision of Womanhood

710
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.700
or the worldly vision of Womanhood

711
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.500
Let me just think about what if you pursued a set

712
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.200
apart kind of life that looks different than your peers.

713
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.200
What if you with with Open Hands what if

714
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.400
you stopped trying to control?

715
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.900
And just let God have it all.

716
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.700
What if you let kindness?

717
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.300
As a fruit of God's spirit in you what

718
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.300
if you let kindness flow out of you and just bless people

719
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.700
all over the place.

720
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.400
What if you stopped looking for what you can get?

721
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.800
And started looking for what you in love can give to

722
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.100
others.

723
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.800
Just like Christ loved us and gave himself for us.

724
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.700
Just imagine a group of women.

725
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.300
Living like that.

726
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.400
With men all around you who are loving faithful

727
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.100
self-controlled as

728
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:18.100
well.

729
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.300
Would that not put forward a different

730
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.200
picture to the world?

731
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.500
It's something has happened here.

732
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.500
Now, yes, that's why we preach the gospel. We're gonna fail at

733
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:33.700
that.

734
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.100
You're gonna fail at godly woman. I'm gonna fail at godly man.

735
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.100
We are all going to fail at that at times which is

736
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.500
why we lean on the blood of Jesus for his forgiveness.

737
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.500
And we have hope even when we don't match up.

738
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.800
but if we pursue just think of this that kind of pursuit

739
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.100
Will Adorn the gospel?

740
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.900
with a spirit transformed kind of life

741
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.600
Our model is not some man or woman here for all

742
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.700
of us men and women our model is Jesus.

743
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.200
And so let's grow into his likeness.

744
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.000
And see how he wants to change us to glorify

745
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.500
him even more.
