1
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:23.655
So church, I've been praying all week that today would be

2
00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.455
a monumental day in the life of our church

3
00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:30.455
because I've been praying that today would be transformative

4
00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:32.335
in each of us individually.

5
00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.895
'cause today what we're coming to in the narrative of

6
00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:40.535
two Samuel is the mostly familiar story of David

7
00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:41.935
with Bathsheba.

8
00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:47.175
But really it's so much bigger than

9
00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:49.695
that in many ways.

10
00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.695
This is your story. My story.

11
00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:57.025
We're gonna see so many parallels of how this works out,

12
00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:00.505
where the way we handle our lives today is similar

13
00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:04.185
to our failures and and even coverups and how we handle

14
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:06.185
and respond to sin in our lives.

15
00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:07.945
All of that. And my prayer is

16
00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:11.665
that we would walk into this today receptive.

17
00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:17.215
Receptive to what God wants to do and reveal in us,

18
00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:21.735
but also receptive to how he wants to heal us.

19
00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.525
That there's freedom. Now, as I've said

20
00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.445
before, up to this point in Second Samuel,

21
00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:30.845
things have been pretty good.

22
00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:33.725
All the victories and anointing is king

23
00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:34.805
and all this things like that.

24
00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:38.735
But today starts the slide for David

25
00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:40.375
and for Israel.

26
00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:43.775
God will still work going forward,

27
00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:49.285
but it will be accompanied by so much trouble along the way

28
00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:53.035
All as a result of this today.

29
00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:55.195
So let's start in chapter 11

30
00:01:56.055 --> 00:02:00.075
of two Samuel, chapter 11.

31
00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:04.875
And as we look at these two chapters,

32
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:05.995
here's what I want you to look for.

33
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.915
Watch for the deadly progression of sin.

34
00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:14.355
Watch as we go through these verses.

35
00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:19.595
Watch for the deadly progression of sin.

36
00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:26.935
We'll just start with verse one, chapter 11,

37
00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:31.545
In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out

38
00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:34.785
to battle, David sent Joab and his servants with him

39
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:37.705
and all Israel and they ravaged the Ammonites

40
00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:38.945
and besieged Reba.

41
00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:42.865
But David remained at Jerusalem.

42
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:46.205
Now this is brilliant narration.

43
00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:49.405
Using that war with the Ammonites as context,

44
00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:52.725
the narrator mentions that this was normal for kings.

45
00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:54.325
Every time the spring would come around,

46
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:56.445
if they were in a battle, they would go out to see how their

47
00:02:57.045 --> 00:02:58.165
warriors were doing.

48
00:02:58.465 --> 00:02:59.605
See how the battle was going.

49
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:03.765
Yet this verse immediately in just a few words,

50
00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:05.165
indicated something was wrong.

51
00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:10.695
It says, but David remained at Jerusalem.

52
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.375
The king had abdicated his responsibility.

53
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:17.375
He wasn't doing what he was supposed to do at that time.

54
00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:18.895
And even further, we see,

55
00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:20.375
look at the first part of verse two.

56
00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:23.935
It happened late one afternoon

57
00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:25.415
where David arose from his couch

58
00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:28.375
and was walking on the roof of the king's house.

59
00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:29.495
We'll stop there for a second.

60
00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:32.815
So not only was David not at the battle like he was supposed

61
00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:34.855
to be here in the middle of the afternoon, he's taken a nap.

62
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:43.375
We don't know whether it was because of pride or laziness

63
00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:45.295
or selfishness, but for some reason

64
00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:47.535
those things had taken over

65
00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:51.095
and David had failed to lead in this moment.

66
00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:54.745
It was a setup for disaster.

67
00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:58.425
Watch what happens here in verse two.

68
00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:00.905
It happened late one afternoon when David arose from his

69
00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:02.705
couch was walking on the roof of the king's house

70
00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:05.465
that he saw from the roof, a woman bathing

71
00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:07.665
and the woman was very beautiful.

72
00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:11.175
You see where this is headed, don't you?

73
00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:14.705
Now I wanna clear something up here

74
00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:15.865
before we go any further.

75
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.505
Before you think this woman was somehow inviting this on

76
00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:23.305
herself by being on her rooftop, taking a bath.

77
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.705
This was what verse four says, her ritual uh,

78
00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:29.985
cleansing process after her monthly cycle.

79
00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:34.585
And so what that means is that this was actually her being

80
00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:37.065
faithful to God in the moment,

81
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:41.545
which means she would've been doing it a very modest private

82
00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:43.665
way getting above everybody else

83
00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:47.065
and trying to stay outta sight and doing it very modestly.

84
00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:48.785
That's what she was doing. It wasn't

85
00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:50.465
what you might imagine it was.

86
00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:55.255
Now David had a choice to make right here.

87
00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:00.055
Yes, he was abdicating his responsibilities.

88
00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:02.135
He was at not at war like he was supposed to be,

89
00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:08.095
but this was still an accident that he happened to see her.

90
00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:13.475
It would, it wasn't like he went on purpose out there,

91
00:05:13.495 --> 00:05:15.195
he just happened to walk outside, saw her.

92
00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.995
So it wasn't on purpose, it was an accident.

93
00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:19.635
But what would he do with that?

94
00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:24.505
Again, watch the deadly progression of sin

95
00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:26.835
verses three through five.

96
00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:31.765
And David sent and inquired about the woman.

97
00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:36.165
One said is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eli,

98
00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:37.645
the wife of Uriah, the Hittite.

99
00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:41.465
And so David sent messengers and took her

100
00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:43.425
and she came to him and he lay with her.

101
00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:46.585
Now she'd been purifying herself from her uncleanness.

102
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:51.215
Then she returned to her house and the woman conceived

103
00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:54.095
and she sent and told David, I'm pregnant

104
00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:01.335
Now David has a problem on his hands

105
00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.365
because where was Uriah?

106
00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:09.365
Uriah, her husband, one of David's 30 mighty men

107
00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:11.365
who were the strongest warriors,

108
00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:13.685
the one they sent into all the battles at the front

109
00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:16.045
that they were the ones who did all the heroic things.

110
00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:19.085
He was out on the battlefield where he was supposed to be,

111
00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:20.365
where David was supposed to be.

112
00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:22.405
Uriah is over there.

113
00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:27.685
And so this is a problem that there's no way to claim.

114
00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:30.005
Uriah is the father.

115
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:36.655
So watch what David did, verses six through 13.

116
00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:42.225
So David sent word to Joab, send me Uriah, the Hittite

117
00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:44.585
and Job sent Uriah to David.

118
00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:47.225
And when Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing

119
00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:49.225
and how the people were doing, how the war was going.

120
00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:52.585
And David said to Uriah, go down to your house

121
00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:53.625
and wash your feet.

122
00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:58.315
Go relax. Basically Uriah went outta the

123
00:06:58.435 --> 00:06:59.515
king's house and there followed

124
00:06:59.515 --> 00:07:00.555
him, a present from the king.

125
00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:03.555
But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house

126
00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:05.515
with all the servants of his Lord

127
00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:07.275
and did not go down to his house.

128
00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:11.385
When they told David Uriah did not go down to his house,

129
00:07:11.385 --> 00:07:13.625
David said to Uriah, have you not come from a journey?

130
00:07:13.685 --> 00:07:15.505
Why did you not go down to your house?

131
00:07:15.715 --> 00:07:19.665
Relax, enjoy a Uriah said to David,

132
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:23.385
the ark in Israel and Judah dwell in booths or tents

133
00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:25.425
and my Lord Joab

134
00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:26.425
and the servants of my Lord,

135
00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:28.745
the the army are camping in the open field.

136
00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:31.855
Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink

137
00:07:31.855 --> 00:07:34.855
and to lie with my wife as you live

138
00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:37.735
and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.

139
00:07:39.945 --> 00:07:42.805
And then David said to Uriah, remain here today also

140
00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:44.005
and tomorrow I'll send you back.

141
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:47.565
So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next

142
00:07:47.565 --> 00:07:49.605
and David invited him and he ate in his presence

143
00:07:49.605 --> 00:07:51.045
and drank so that he made him drunk.

144
00:07:51.065 --> 00:07:53.205
And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch

145
00:07:53.205 --> 00:07:54.245
with the servants of the Lord.

146
00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:57.485
But he did not go down to his house.

147
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:05.255
This was David's effort to try to cover up the problem,

148
00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:10.955
to try to get Uriah to enjoy his wife

149
00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:14.675
and then be able to claim that that baby was Uriah's.

150
00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:16.555
'cause remember they didn't have DNA tests back then.

151
00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:18.835
It was just like it was the same kind of timeframe.

152
00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.075
Surely that's Uriah's.

153
00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:28.015
Yet did you see how honorable Uriah was in this moment?

154
00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:32.985
Like he couldn't even fathom that his buddies are living and

155
00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:35.385
and fighting on the battlefield and he's over here.

156
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:37.905
There's no way he could do that. It would not feel right.

157
00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:40.025
He's that honorable of a man.

158
00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:44.345
Quite the comparison to David in this moment.

159
00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:48.775
David even tried to get him drunk to to

160
00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:53.215
where he would do it just because and and he still didn't.

161
00:08:56.925 --> 00:08:59.105
The deadly progression of sin continued.

162
00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:01.865
Look at verses 14 through 17

163
00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:06.725
in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joe Abs,

164
00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:07.885
sent it by the hand of Uriah.

165
00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:11.365
In the letter he wrote, set Uriah in the forefront

166
00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:13.445
of the hardest fighting, then draw back from him

167
00:09:13.445 --> 00:09:15.485
that he may be struck down and die.

168
00:09:17.845 --> 00:09:20.305
And as Joab was Besieging the city, he assigned Uriah

169
00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:22.345
to the place where he knew there were valiant men.

170
00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:24.585
And the men of the city came out, fought against Joab

171
00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:26.025
and some of the servants of David

172
00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:27.745
among the people fell Uriah.

173
00:09:27.925 --> 00:09:29.985
The Hittite also died.

174
00:09:33.075 --> 00:09:37.525
So the coverup continued now even further

175
00:09:39.485 --> 00:09:41.305
by putting this woman's husband to death,

176
00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:43.145
essentially murdering him

177
00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:46.065
by putting him in an impossible situation at the forefront

178
00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:47.785
of the battle everybody else pulls back.

179
00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:49.225
And so he takes all the arrows.

180
00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:55.525
He had no chance, which then

181
00:09:55.585 --> 00:09:57.685
led David to eventually do what he did.

182
00:09:57.685 --> 00:10:01.965
Looked down at verse 26, this was after the news came back

183
00:10:01.965 --> 00:10:03.765
and forth and everything happened.

184
00:10:03.765 --> 00:10:07.285
And he found out in 26 when the wife of Uriah heard

185
00:10:07.285 --> 00:10:08.885
that Uriah, her husband was dead,

186
00:10:08.985 --> 00:10:10.565
she lamented over her husband.

187
00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:13.925
And when the morning was over, David sent

188
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:16.365
and brought her to his house and she became his wife

189
00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:18.445
and bore him a son.

190
00:10:22.145 --> 00:10:25.325
Do you see the deadly progression

191
00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:28.825
of sin in David's life?

192
00:10:30.025 --> 00:10:31.555
Like just watch this. Let's track

193
00:10:31.555 --> 00:10:33.595
through from the very beginning, let's go all the way back

194
00:10:33.775 --> 00:10:35.155
to before anything happened.

195
00:10:35.325 --> 00:10:38.875
David could have followed the lead of job who said,

196
00:10:38.935 --> 00:10:41.235
I'm gonna make a covenant with my eyes not

197
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.075
to look upon a woman with lust.

198
00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:45.955
Job 31 1. He said, I'm not gonna do it at all.

199
00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:47.875
David could have said, I'm not gonna do it either.

200
00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:50.835
But he looked when he should have looked away.

201
00:10:54.595 --> 00:10:58.945
Now he could have cut it off right there, dealt with

202
00:10:58.945 --> 00:11:00.585
that in his heart, said okay, no, I gotta fight

203
00:11:00.585 --> 00:11:01.625
that lust, gotta kill it.

204
00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:04.225
Okay, I gotta do that. I mean he could have repented

205
00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:05.545
and walked in holiness,

206
00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:10.665
but instead he began to covet

207
00:11:11.215 --> 00:11:13.585
this other man's wife, which is the number 10

208
00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:14.665
of the 10 commandments.

209
00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:19.855
And he began to want that and

210
00:11:19.855 --> 00:11:22.935
and so he could have at that point, even again, cut it off.

211
00:11:22.935 --> 00:11:24.135
He could have stopped right there.

212
00:11:24.195 --> 00:11:26.855
He could have dealt with it. He could have ruthlessly

213
00:11:26.855 --> 00:11:27.895
dealt with the sin in his heart.

214
00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:29.295
Say man, like why is that coveting in there?

215
00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.295
I don't want that. God, I don't want that anymore.

216
00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:32.615
He could have stopped right there,

217
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:39.285
but no, he instead broke then

218
00:11:40.225 --> 00:11:42.445
the seventh commandment

219
00:11:43.695 --> 00:11:46.475
by abusing his power over this innocent woman

220
00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:49.275
and taking her to commit adultery.

221
00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:54.925
And then when his manipulation of the situation and lying

222
00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:57.165
and cheating and all the things to try to get all

223
00:11:57.165 --> 00:11:58.165
that done didn't work.

224
00:11:58.745 --> 00:12:03.675
It progressed to breaking the sixth commandment, murder.

225
00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:09.555
All of those were just to try to cover up his initial sin.

226
00:12:09.575 --> 00:12:11.075
The first one he was just trying

227
00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:12.355
to make sure he didn't happen.

228
00:12:12.695 --> 00:12:13.835
Uh, it didn't get

229
00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:18.695
caught, man.

230
00:12:20.195 --> 00:12:22.705
James one is so clear

231
00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:25.385
on sins deadly progression.

232
00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:29.545
Listen to this. But each person is tempted when he's lured

233
00:12:29.545 --> 00:12:31.265
and enticed by his own desire.

234
00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:36.065
And then desire when it has conceived, gives birth to sin

235
00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:40.225
and sin when it is fully grown, brings forth death.

236
00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:41.305
Do you not see it here?

237
00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:52.365
The temptation is not the sin, it's

238
00:12:52.365 --> 00:12:53.845
what you do with it in your heart.

239
00:12:57.555 --> 00:13:00.015
And if you have any unaddressed weakness

240
00:13:01.795 --> 00:13:04.455
and then you face an unexpected opportunity,

241
00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:07.255
it can lead to disaster.

242
00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:14.035
Now here's the crazy thing about this.

243
00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:20.595
David at this point probably thought

244
00:13:21.605 --> 00:13:25.625
it worked because this

245
00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:27.345
was nine months.

246
00:13:27.455 --> 00:13:28.785
Bathsheba has given birth.

247
00:13:28.845 --> 00:13:31.385
Now she got pregnant at the sin time.

248
00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:36.625
So nine months later, since that time, she gives birth

249
00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:38.785
and she'd been David's wife ever since

250
00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:40.985
that beginning point roughly nine months ago.

251
00:13:41.205 --> 00:13:44.185
And so surely everybody thinks, well that's David's child.

252
00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:46.665
And so you can imagine David at this point saying,

253
00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:48.545
whew man, I'm safe.

254
00:13:51.575 --> 00:13:54.345
Made it. I'm okay. Everything is fine.

255
00:13:58.195 --> 00:14:01.655
If you hear nothing else today, if you write one thing down

256
00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:03.935
and you walk away with one thing, hear this

257
00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:07.335
Satan's primary lie.

258
00:14:07.435 --> 00:14:10.695
His main lie is when he whispers in your heart,

259
00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:12.695
Nobody's gonna find out.

260
00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:21.595
He just plants that little seed in your heart,

261
00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.635
in your mind saying nobody's gonna know.

262
00:14:29.345 --> 00:14:32.125
But look at the very last phrase of verse 27 here.

263
00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:33.005
But

264
00:14:37.685 --> 00:14:39.925
the thing that David had done

265
00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:44.905
and displeased the Lord like

266
00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:48.385
so simple yet so piercing.

267
00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:52.205
'cause the way it actually says it's just displease the Lord

268
00:14:52.205 --> 00:14:53.325
like he had a bad meal.

269
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:55.805
It's like it, the way it says in Hebrew is

270
00:14:55.805 --> 00:14:58.285
that it was evil in the Lord's sight.

271
00:15:00.185 --> 00:15:04.475
What David had done was evil before God.

272
00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:06.395
Listen, we gotta hear this today.

273
00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:09.595
There is no such thing as hidden sin.

274
00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:14.595
It every secret sin is in full

275
00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:16.235
view of a holy God.

276
00:15:18.495 --> 00:15:20.465
There's nothing you can text or look at

277
00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:23.505
or think about that he doesn't see you do.

278
00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:30.055
That's why Hebrews four 13 Demolishes,

279
00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:32.855
every delusion we have about that, it says,

280
00:15:32.955 --> 00:15:37.215
no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked

281
00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:41.415
and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

282
00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.165
We should never think

283
00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:51.005
that any sin is just not that big a deal.

284
00:15:51.715 --> 00:15:52.925
Well, not doing what David did,

285
00:15:52.925 --> 00:15:54.725
it's just this white little lie or whatever it is.

286
00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:55.965
Like it's just not a big deal.

287
00:15:56.185 --> 00:15:59.605
No, listen, God almighty sees it

288
00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:03.135
and he is a god of justice.

289
00:16:04.435 --> 00:16:08.615
We must not skate past that, just defaulting into mercy.

290
00:16:08.955 --> 00:16:10.975
We must not take for granted the mercy of God

291
00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:14.335
because of the terrible justice of God.

292
00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:16.455
We've gotta respect this.

293
00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:19.535
And when I say the word terrible, that means awe inspiring.

294
00:16:19.675 --> 00:16:21.935
It means something that you can't help

295
00:16:21.955 --> 00:16:23.615
but be afraid of a little bit, right?

296
00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.535
That's terrible. That's what that word means.

297
00:16:25.795 --> 00:16:27.135
We have to respect this.

298
00:16:31.485 --> 00:16:33.215
Like even if David thought he was fine,

299
00:16:33.645 --> 00:16:35.455
nine months later I'm safe.

300
00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:38.975
God was not through with David's heart yet

301
00:16:43.145 --> 00:16:44.775
watch God's precision.

302
00:16:46.695 --> 00:16:51.585
Cutting to the heart of David chapter 12,

303
00:16:52.695 --> 00:16:54.515
God sends Nathan the prophet

304
00:16:56.955 --> 00:16:58.765
chapter 12 verses one through six.

305
00:16:58.765 --> 00:17:00.605
And the Lord sent Nathan to David.

306
00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:03.485
He came to him and said to him,

307
00:17:03.615 --> 00:17:05.405
there were two men in a certain city,

308
00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:07.165
the one rich and the other poor.

309
00:17:08.225 --> 00:17:10.525
The rich man had very many flocks and herds,

310
00:17:10.525 --> 00:17:11.885
but the poor man had nothing

311
00:17:11.985 --> 00:17:14.525
but one little U lamb which he had bought.

312
00:17:15.275 --> 00:17:16.975
And he brought it up and it grew up with him

313
00:17:16.975 --> 00:17:19.775
and with his children it used to eat of his morsel

314
00:17:19.775 --> 00:17:21.815
and drink from his cup and lie in his arms.

315
00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:23.935
It was like a daughter to him.

316
00:17:26.205 --> 00:17:28.025
Now there came a traveler to the rich man

317
00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:30.705
and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock

318
00:17:30.765 --> 00:17:32.985
or herd to prepare for the guest who'd come to him.

319
00:17:33.565 --> 00:17:35.665
But he took the poor man's lamb

320
00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:38.425
and prepared it for the man who had come to him.

321
00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:43.905
Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man.

322
00:17:43.905 --> 00:17:46.025
And he said to Nathan, as the Lord lives,

323
00:17:46.085 --> 00:17:48.345
the man who's done this deserves to die.

324
00:17:49.105 --> 00:17:50.965
He shall restore the lamb fourfold.

325
00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:52.485
He, because he did this thing and

326
00:17:52.485 --> 00:17:54.685
because he had no pity,

327
00:17:56.615 --> 00:17:57.745
like isn't that amazing?

328
00:17:57.805 --> 00:18:02.185
Do you see how God confronted David by using this parable

329
00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:05.145
that created an emotional response in David?

330
00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:07.985
He got so angry at this rich man

331
00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:10.985
who took the one lamb from the poor man

332
00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:13.185
and he was so mad at that guy.

333
00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:14.505
He's like, let's go kill him right now.

334
00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:19.505
He said all of that, not realizing the plank in his own

335
00:18:20.085 --> 00:18:24.395
eye that he had taken Bathsheba

336
00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:26.225
from your eye.

337
00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.615
That's why verse seven starts

338
00:18:31.685 --> 00:18:34.095
with the sword thrust of divine truth.

339
00:18:34.105 --> 00:18:37.975
Watch this, Nathan said to David, you are the man.

340
00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:43.655
That's you, David, this whole parable that's about you.

341
00:18:45.645 --> 00:18:48.545
You are the one who did that very thing.

342
00:18:48.725 --> 00:18:51.545
And so there was no, for David hide,

343
00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:55.215
his sin had been exposed.

344
00:18:55.315 --> 00:18:56.655
He couldn't cover it up anymore.

345
00:18:56.915 --> 00:18:58.735
He couldn't lie his way out of it anymore.

346
00:18:59.275 --> 00:19:01.215
He was guilty,

347
00:19:05.695 --> 00:19:07.165
which prepared the way for Nathan

348
00:19:07.265 --> 00:19:08.765
to twist the knife even more.

349
00:19:08.775 --> 00:19:13.645
Watch David's David received the indictment from God

350
00:19:14.775 --> 00:19:15.835
verses seven through nine.

351
00:19:18.035 --> 00:19:20.095
Nathan said to David, you are the man

352
00:19:22.015 --> 00:19:23.825
thus says the Lord, the God of Israel.

353
00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:25.985
I anointed you king over Israel.

354
00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:28.105
I delivered you outta the hand of Saul.

355
00:19:28.385 --> 00:19:29.545
I gave you into your master.

356
00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:31.865
I gave your master's house and your master's wives

357
00:19:31.865 --> 00:19:33.425
and into your arms and gave you the house

358
00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:35.185
of Israel and of Judah.

359
00:19:35.365 --> 00:19:36.385
And if this were too little,

360
00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:37.865
I would add to you as much more.

361
00:19:39.335 --> 00:19:42.915
Why have you despised the word of the Lord to do

362
00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:44.115
what is evil in his sight?

363
00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:47.015
You've struck down your eye.

364
00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:49.015
The Hittite with the sword have taken his wife

365
00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:51.215
to be your wife and have killed him with the sword

366
00:19:51.755 --> 00:19:52.855
of the Ammonites.

367
00:19:54.955 --> 00:19:59.645
Isn't that just crushing? Like look at what God says.

368
00:20:01.265 --> 00:20:05.215
God says, David, I anointed you. I delivered you.

369
00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:07.795
I gave you this house.

370
00:20:09.555 --> 00:20:13.055
Why have you despised the word of the Lord

371
00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:14.575
to do what is evil?

372
00:20:17.765 --> 00:20:21.475
David had received grace upon grace beyond measure.

373
00:20:21.735 --> 00:20:25.235
He had come from the shepherd's house to the throne

374
00:20:25.295 --> 00:20:28.275
of Israel to become the most prominent king in all

375
00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:29.275
of the world in many ways.

376
00:20:29.535 --> 00:20:32.595
And he trampled all over that for a moment

377
00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:33.635
of selfish pleasure.

378
00:20:36.995 --> 00:20:38.145
Isn't that sad?

379
00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.395
But isn't that what you and I do every single day?

380
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.215
Like this is the anatomy of sin that we

381
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:55.775
despise the goodness of God

382
00:20:57.515 --> 00:21:00.695
and we exchange his glory for created things.

383
00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:04.005
We turn our back on his goodness

384
00:21:04.005 --> 00:21:05.365
and we say, no, I'm gonna do it my way.

385
00:21:05.755 --> 00:21:08.965
I've got a better plan. That's the anatomy of sin.

386
00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:11.965
And I can give you millions of examples.

387
00:21:14.235 --> 00:21:19.035
Just give you a couple. God

388
00:21:19.095 --> 00:21:22.005
has accepted us as we are.

389
00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:25.765
Yet we then turn around

390
00:21:26.425 --> 00:21:28.485
and use gossip to try to elevate ourselves

391
00:21:28.485 --> 00:21:32.465
above other people, exchanging the glory

392
00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:34.585
of God for created things.

393
00:21:36.255 --> 00:21:37.155
Self-promotion.

394
00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:42.055
God has blessed you.

395
00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:46.295
Married couples with sexual fulfillment in marriage

396
00:21:47.355 --> 00:21:48.735
and you're addicted to pornography.

397
00:21:51.105 --> 00:21:52.425
Exchange the glory of God for created things.

398
00:21:57.155 --> 00:22:00.325
He's entrusted money to us to meet our needs

399
00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.485
and to play a part in the kingdom of God advancing.

400
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:04.885
That's why he gave us the money he gave us.

401
00:22:04.985 --> 00:22:07.085
Yet we turn around and instead buy more toys

402
00:22:07.105 --> 00:22:08.525
and more experiences for ourselves.

403
00:22:11.085 --> 00:22:12.395
Glory of God for created things.

404
00:22:18.715 --> 00:22:20.015
God is the author of life.

405
00:22:22.715 --> 00:22:26.215
Yet we try to take control of that with a missed period pill

406
00:22:27.065 --> 00:22:28.875
because we don't wanna deal with the shame

407
00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:30.555
that will come from an unexpected pregnancy.

408
00:22:33.555 --> 00:22:35.505
Glory of God created

409
00:22:35.505 --> 00:22:39.025
things and on and on and on.

410
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:43.045
We could go. You are the

411
00:22:43.065 --> 00:22:45.535
man, you are the woman.

412
00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:48.215
I am the man in the parable.

413
00:22:48.275 --> 00:22:50.615
You are the person in the parable.

414
00:22:51.525 --> 00:22:52.895
Stop pointing fingers at everybody else.

415
00:22:53.025 --> 00:22:54.815
Their sins worse than mine. No, no.

416
00:22:54.955 --> 00:22:58.815
All of us, all of us are guilty before God.

417
00:22:58.815 --> 00:23:01.415
And listen, if you are not a follower of Christ, all

418
00:23:01.415 --> 00:23:03.135
of those things and all the other things

419
00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:04.775
will send you to hell.

420
00:23:05.475 --> 00:23:06.735
One Corinthians six. You will

421
00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:07.935
not inherit the kingdom of God.

422
00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:19.275
But even if you are a follower of Christ, we

423
00:23:19.415 --> 00:23:24.115
so quickly gloss over, whitewash over the consequences

424
00:23:24.295 --> 00:23:28.755
of sin in our lives from all of those sins that we

425
00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:30.315
exchange the glory of God for

426
00:23:34.595 --> 00:23:39.335
we are forgiven, but pain still comes

427
00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:41.695
when we sin against God.

428
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.450
That's what we see next. In verses 10 through 12,

429
00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:54.905
God says, now therefore the sword shall never depart from

430
00:23:54.905 --> 00:23:58.245
your house, David, because you've despised me

431
00:23:58.245 --> 00:24:00.245
and have taken the wife of your eye, the Hittite

432
00:24:00.245 --> 00:24:02.765
to be your wife, thus says the Lord, behold,

433
00:24:02.765 --> 00:24:05.245
I will raise up evil against you out of your own house.

434
00:24:06.305 --> 00:24:07.445
And I will take your wife

435
00:24:07.705 --> 00:24:09.805
before your eyes, give them to your neighbor.

436
00:24:09.905 --> 00:24:12.085
He shall lie with your wives in the sight of this son

437
00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:13.525
for you did it secretly.

438
00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:16.165
But I will do this thing before all Israel and

439
00:24:16.165 --> 00:24:20.735
before the Son even verse 14,

440
00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:24.695
because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord.

441
00:24:24.995 --> 00:24:29.015
The child who is born to you shall die.

442
00:24:30.645 --> 00:24:33.335
That was the child that Bathsheba confe conceived.

443
00:24:33.335 --> 00:24:34.655
Nine months later, all of

444
00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:36.495
that God says, that child's gonna die.

445
00:24:39.015 --> 00:24:42.925
These are the consequences for David's sin.

446
00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:46.765
David, one person, all of those wreckages

447
00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:50.005
around him was because of his sin.

448
00:24:50.955 --> 00:24:53.405
He'd be forgiven. Absolutely. We'll get to that later.

449
00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:56.965
But the consequences of sin would follow him to his grave.

450
00:24:57.945 --> 00:24:59.565
The sword would never depart from his house.

451
00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:01.125
What that means is he would always have

452
00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:02.405
strife and rebellion.

453
00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:05.965
Even more of his sons would die by their own swords.

454
00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:09.325
All of that would happen because of his sin.

455
00:25:09.485 --> 00:25:11.445
I say all that Christian to remind us

456
00:25:11.755 --> 00:25:13.405
that God's forgiveness is free.

457
00:25:13.615 --> 00:25:15.045
God's forgiveness is full,

458
00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:16.365
but the consequences

459
00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:19.525
of sin in this fallen world will remain.

460
00:25:22.685 --> 00:25:24.615
Galatians six, you reap what you sow.

461
00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:27.695
God designed the world in a certain way.

462
00:25:27.995 --> 00:25:30.015
It happens as a result of that.

463
00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:32.815
We cannot play with fire and expect not to be burned.

464
00:25:35.615 --> 00:25:39.275
And even when their fire is put out, the scars

465
00:25:39.295 --> 00:25:41.435
of the burn still remain.

466
00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:48.695
That's why quick repentance is so critical,

467
00:25:50.065 --> 00:25:51.235
even in the life of the believer.

468
00:25:51.235 --> 00:25:55.075
It's not just to get into heaven, it's repentance day

469
00:25:55.125 --> 00:25:59.535
after day after day after day because we need it

470
00:26:01.725 --> 00:26:04.105
and we need to stay close to the Lord in fellowship.

471
00:26:05.695 --> 00:26:07.915
And so that's what we wanna give you some space

472
00:26:08.015 --> 00:26:11.045
for here in the next few minutes should be daily.

473
00:26:11.105 --> 00:26:12.325
But just for a moment,

474
00:26:12.325 --> 00:26:15.085
because every one of us has something we need to come

475
00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:18.365
before the Lord and say, God, I am wrong in this.

476
00:26:18.685 --> 00:26:19.965
I need to confess this.

477
00:26:19.965 --> 00:26:21.485
By the way, confession is not saying

478
00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:23.285
to God something he doesn't already know.

479
00:26:23.385 --> 00:26:25.885
You're agreeing with God that that is sin.

480
00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:27.945
And you say, God, this is what I've done.

481
00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:29.545
This is my sin in my life.

482
00:26:29.585 --> 00:26:31.185
I need you to remove it from my life.

483
00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:34.265
I need you to change my heart. That's confession.

484
00:26:36.015 --> 00:26:39.595
And so this is a time to open your life, to open your heart,

485
00:26:39.775 --> 00:26:41.835
to break through whatever wall that you've built

486
00:26:41.865 --> 00:26:42.955
between you and God.

487
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.685
He didn't go anywhere. You walked away

488
00:26:44.685 --> 00:26:47.925
and built a wall up there by your own sin.

489
00:26:48.185 --> 00:26:49.925
How do you get past that? And you break through.

490
00:26:49.925 --> 00:26:54.545
That starts with confession. It starts with owning it.

491
00:26:58.215 --> 00:26:59.435
Now we're not through with the story yet,

492
00:26:59.435 --> 00:27:00.755
so I'm gonna come back here in a little bit

493
00:27:00.855 --> 00:27:02.995
and we'll finish that so you don't need to leave, but,

494
00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:05.755
but let's just sit in this for a while

495
00:27:07.655 --> 00:27:10.195
and we're gonna sing a song and,

496
00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:12.075
and it will maybe give you some words,

497
00:27:12.335 --> 00:27:15.595
but I, I don't, I don't want us

498
00:27:15.595 --> 00:27:18.475
to move past that.

499
00:27:18.615 --> 00:27:21.955
The weight of sin too quickly.

500
00:27:25.825 --> 00:27:30.085
We, we need, we need to feel it a little bit or else grace

501
00:27:30.145 --> 00:27:32.925
and mercy isn't as great as we might say it is

502
00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:35.485
or think it is because we need to sit in this.

503
00:27:35.745 --> 00:27:39.005
So, so as as we sing this song together, this is not,

504
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:46.005
maybe you just need to pray the words your head bowed,

505
00:27:46.065 --> 00:27:48.085
I'd clo just like processing.

506
00:27:48.105 --> 00:27:49.845
God, show me where I'm wrong.

507
00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:51.765
Show me any wicked way within me.

508
00:27:51.915 --> 00:27:53.525
Lead me like I need you, God.

509
00:27:53.625 --> 00:27:57.285
And and agree with them in that even you get on your face

510
00:27:57.285 --> 00:27:59.245
before I'm right now or on your knees just, just

511
00:27:59.245 --> 00:28:03.045
to reflect head down and and say, God, where am I?

512
00:28:04.485 --> 00:28:07.825
What's between us? And confess it

513
00:28:09.365 --> 00:28:12.105
and I'll come back in a little bit, but let's just rest.

514
00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:15.745
Sit in this for a while. In this moment

515
00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:46.385
You see,

516
00:29:17.545 --> 00:29:21.885
you hear my voice, you hear his life,

517
00:29:25.465 --> 00:29:26.085
you hear

518
00:29:44.065 --> 00:29:44.725
my love.

519
00:30:18.535 --> 00:30:19.675
You know my

520
00:30:19.675 --> 00:30:20.675
Heart.

521
00:30:21.055 --> 00:30:22.755
You know my Heart.

522
00:30:24.065 --> 00:30:27.555
Deep inside, you know My,

523
00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:45.595
my love.

524
00:30:53.015 --> 00:30:56.035
Fix my Soul upon

525
00:31:14.975 --> 00:31:15.975
My heart.

526
00:31:17.185 --> 00:31:22.155
Burn it down to to

527
00:31:27.415 --> 00:31:27.835
Christ.

528
00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:28.755
My glory

529
00:31:33.455 --> 00:31:36.355
of my

530
00:31:36.485 --> 00:31:36.835
Heart,

531
00:31:49.055 --> 00:31:52.075
my Christ, my

532
00:32:09.945 --> 00:32:10.835
into my.

533
00:32:42.825 --> 00:32:44.845
Now here's the question that comes up at this point.

534
00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:51.085
How could God forgive David for all that he'd done?

535
00:32:52.795 --> 00:32:57.005
Intentional sins like assault, adultery,

536
00:32:57.185 --> 00:32:59.125
murder, manipulation.

537
00:33:02.035 --> 00:33:05.645
Like if we take this literally, if we take this to the place

538
00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:10.045
where the law would say we should go, he deserved death.

539
00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:13.525
The letter of the law said you deserve death.

540
00:33:15.565 --> 00:33:17.905
And so how could Nathan say in verse 13,

541
00:33:18.285 --> 00:33:20.425
the Lord has put away your sin, you shall not die.

542
00:33:22.215 --> 00:33:24.225
Like how's it even possible for David?

543
00:33:24.835 --> 00:33:26.585
How's that fair guide?

544
00:33:26.585 --> 00:33:28.585
Just a couple chapters to go touch the ark and die?

545
00:33:28.585 --> 00:33:29.985
Like how is this for David?

546
00:33:32.095 --> 00:33:34.795
The reality is that mercy is never

547
00:33:35.505 --> 00:33:36.505
Fair.

548
00:33:38.305 --> 00:33:41.035
Mercy's never fair. And what we discover is

549
00:33:41.035 --> 00:33:43.595
that God forgave David in anticipation

550
00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:45.835
of the greater sacrifice that was to come.

551
00:33:46.595 --> 00:33:48.755
'cause Hebrews 10 talks about even if David would've done

552
00:33:48.975 --> 00:33:50.795
all the sacrifices of bulls and goats

553
00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:52.675
and all those things, it still wouldn't have been enough.

554
00:33:52.685 --> 00:33:55.515
There still needed to be a perfect sacrifice.

555
00:33:55.525 --> 00:33:57.115
Those could never take away sins.

556
00:33:57.255 --> 00:34:01.395
But the perfect sacrifice, Jesus Christ actually can

557
00:34:01.785 --> 00:34:04.155
because he was the one who faced every temptation that you

558
00:34:04.155 --> 00:34:06.515
and I faced yet never gave in, never sin.

559
00:34:06.705 --> 00:34:09.275
He's also the one who's finished work accomplished all

560
00:34:09.275 --> 00:34:12.635
that we need to bring about our salvation.

561
00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:16.555
Now, I know David lived a thousand years before Jesus came

562
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:19.675
and did what he did, but David was still looking to Yahweh

563
00:34:19.895 --> 00:34:22.515
as the only one who could cover his sin.

564
00:34:23.505 --> 00:34:27.485
The only one who could actually take care of by faith,

565
00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:29.725
take care of David's sin.

566
00:34:30.975 --> 00:34:32.735
'cause look at what David said here. Verse 13.

567
00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:35.175
His sin was exposed, his heart was convicted.

568
00:34:35.175 --> 00:34:36.935
Watch what David says to Nathan,

569
00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:40.615
I have sinned against the Lord.

570
00:34:43.075 --> 00:34:47.095
Simple. I've sinned against the Lord.

571
00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:49.775
Remember the previous king, Saul deflected blamed.

572
00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:51.855
He never took ownership of his sin.

573
00:34:52.065 --> 00:34:54.575
David understood what he'd done.

574
00:34:54.595 --> 00:34:57.295
He said, no, I sinned against the Lord.

575
00:34:57.485 --> 00:34:59.175
I've sinned against others. I've heard other people.

576
00:34:59.495 --> 00:35:03.335
I understand that. But God is the ultimate authority.

577
00:35:04.795 --> 00:35:07.455
That's who our sin is against primarily.

578
00:35:07.535 --> 00:35:08.695
I love what Jerry Bridges said.

579
00:35:09.005 --> 00:35:12.455
Failure to see our sin as primarily against God

580
00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:14.495
is the reason we experienced

581
00:35:14.515 --> 00:35:16.335
so little heartfelt grief over it.

582
00:35:19.465 --> 00:35:21.215
David saw that David repented.

583
00:35:21.215 --> 00:35:22.615
In fact, we see a record of

584
00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:25.015
that experience over in Psalm 51.

585
00:35:25.015 --> 00:35:26.215
So I wanna invite you to turn there.

586
00:35:26.945 --> 00:35:29.095
David wrote this psalm in response to

587
00:35:29.095 --> 00:35:33.575
what we just saw in Second Samuel Psalm 51.

588
00:35:36.215 --> 00:35:37.365
I'm gonna read most of it because

589
00:35:37.725 --> 00:35:41.045
'cause now with the context, like you can read Psalm 51

590
00:35:41.045 --> 00:35:43.525
every day, any day, but now feel

591
00:35:43.675 --> 00:35:48.315
what David would've been feeling in the moment as he's going

592
00:35:48.315 --> 00:35:49.835
through what he's going through in Psalm 50

593
00:35:49.835 --> 00:35:52.435
and in two Samuel 11 and 12, what's he feeling?

594
00:35:52.535 --> 00:35:54.195
How is he respond? Here it is.

595
00:35:56.855 --> 00:35:57.805
Psalm 51,

596
00:36:01.595 --> 00:36:02.885
have mercy on me.

597
00:36:02.885 --> 00:36:05.845
Oh God, according to your steadfast love.

598
00:36:05.845 --> 00:36:09.285
That's that hesed covenant kindness we saw last week

599
00:36:09.285 --> 00:36:11.045
according to your abundant mercy.

600
00:36:11.485 --> 00:36:13.005
Blot out my transgressions,

601
00:36:14.475 --> 00:36:16.365
wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.

602
00:36:16.365 --> 00:36:19.725
Cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions.

603
00:36:19.745 --> 00:36:22.805
My sin is ever before me against you.

604
00:36:23.505 --> 00:36:25.005
You only have I sinned

605
00:36:25.145 --> 00:36:27.245
and done what is evil in your sight so

606
00:36:27.245 --> 00:36:28.725
that you may be justified in your words,

607
00:36:28.725 --> 00:36:29.765
blameless in your judgment.

608
00:36:30.025 --> 00:36:32.445
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity and sined.

609
00:36:32.445 --> 00:36:33.445
My mother conceived me.

610
00:36:34.665 --> 00:36:38.125
Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being you teach

611
00:36:38.125 --> 00:36:39.765
me wisdom in the secret heart.

612
00:36:41.025 --> 00:36:44.015
Purge me with his up. I shall be clean. Wash me.

613
00:36:44.175 --> 00:36:47.785
I shall be wider than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness.

614
00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:49.545
Let the bones you've broken rejoice.

615
00:36:50.965 --> 00:36:53.895
Hide your face from my sins. Blot out all my iniquities.

616
00:36:54.155 --> 00:36:55.855
Create in me a clean heart.

617
00:36:55.875 --> 00:36:58.535
Oh God, renew a right spirit within me.

618
00:36:59.325 --> 00:37:00.895
Cast me not away from your presence.

619
00:37:01.165 --> 00:37:02.935
Take not your holy Spirit from me.

620
00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:05.335
Restore to me the joy of your salvation.

621
00:37:05.555 --> 00:37:07.055
Uphold me with a willing spirit.

622
00:37:08.365 --> 00:37:10.295
Then I will teach transgressors your ways

623
00:37:10.445 --> 00:37:11.895
sinners will return to you.

624
00:37:12.085 --> 00:37:14.215
Deliver me from blood guiltiness, oh God,

625
00:37:14.235 --> 00:37:15.295
oh God, of my salvation.

626
00:37:15.595 --> 00:37:17.815
My tongue will sing out of your righteousness.

627
00:37:18.395 --> 00:37:21.095
Oh Lord, open my lips, my mouth will declare your praise

628
00:37:21.435 --> 00:37:24.135
for you will not delight and sacrifice or I would give it.

629
00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:26.215
You will not be pleased with a burn offering.

630
00:37:26.475 --> 00:37:30.455
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken

631
00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:31.655
and contrite heart.

632
00:37:31.755 --> 00:37:36.735
Oh God, you will not despise like you.

633
00:37:36.735 --> 00:37:39.745
See this. David turned

634
00:37:40.205 --> 00:37:41.905
to the Lord for mercy.

635
00:37:42.245 --> 00:37:44.545
He knew that God was the only one who was the source

636
00:37:44.645 --> 00:37:46.825
of steadfast love, never ending kindness.

637
00:37:47.225 --> 00:37:51.145
I need that. He's crying out for a ing

638
00:37:52.885 --> 00:37:55.985
his sin he knew had made him spiritually dirty.

639
00:37:56.205 --> 00:37:57.945
He had broken his fellowship with God.

640
00:37:57.945 --> 00:38:00.145
And so he's like, God, I need you to wash me clean

641
00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:02.225
and bring me back into your presence.

642
00:38:04.465 --> 00:38:06.565
That's what verse seven was referring

643
00:38:06.565 --> 00:38:07.845
to when he talked about the hisp.

644
00:38:07.875 --> 00:38:11.165
That was a plant that all over the Old Testament was both a

645
00:38:11.165 --> 00:38:14.885
symbol and a tool of God's cleansing over people.

646
00:38:14.995 --> 00:38:17.005
They would use it to brush the blood over the

647
00:38:17.005 --> 00:38:18.285
doorposts at Passover.

648
00:38:18.395 --> 00:38:20.845
They would use it to, to cleanse lepers, all that.

649
00:38:20.905 --> 00:38:23.445
It was like he knew I need internal cleansing.

650
00:38:23.465 --> 00:38:25.125
God, I'm dirty. I'm wicked.

651
00:38:25.245 --> 00:38:30.125
I need you to wash me clean, to cry for mercy.

652
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:34.745
And gratefully, God showed David mercy, right?

653
00:38:35.705 --> 00:38:37.045
He didn't give him what he deserved.

654
00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:39.565
But I want you to think about this from our perspective.

655
00:38:42.005 --> 00:38:46.795
David had what he had at the time and he cried for mercy.

656
00:38:47.415 --> 00:38:51.915
We today have so much more understanding than David had.

657
00:38:52.055 --> 00:38:54.355
He was placing his faith in a promise.

658
00:38:54.655 --> 00:38:58.555
He was looking forward to a savior redeemer to come

659
00:38:58.775 --> 00:38:59.955
and he knew it was gonna happen.

660
00:38:59.955 --> 00:39:02.795
Genesis three said it would and it was going to happen.

661
00:39:03.135 --> 00:39:05.755
But we now know looking back, that's Jesus

662
00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:08.955
who is our great high priest who did everything needed

663
00:39:08.975 --> 00:39:10.555
for us to be saved.

664
00:39:10.555 --> 00:39:11.835
That's what one John two says.

665
00:39:12.135 --> 00:39:14.355
My little children, I'm writing these things to you

666
00:39:14.455 --> 00:39:15.715
so you may not sin,

667
00:39:16.015 --> 00:39:18.795
but if anyone does sin, we have an advocate

668
00:39:18.795 --> 00:39:21.675
with the Father Jesus Christ, the righteous.

669
00:39:22.455 --> 00:39:25.835
He is the propitiation for our sins, not for ours only,

670
00:39:25.835 --> 00:39:26.995
but for the sins of the whole world.

671
00:39:27.255 --> 00:39:29.075
That's who Jesus is.

672
00:39:29.255 --> 00:39:33.355
Our great redeemer who paid the price

673
00:39:34.175 --> 00:39:38.675
for us that we deserved, he took it and it counts.

674
00:39:40.725 --> 00:39:44.845
And so that is why even more than David could,

675
00:39:45.865 --> 00:39:50.245
we today can exalt the immeasurable mercy of our God.

676
00:39:52.335 --> 00:39:56.865
Like we, we do need to understand the justice

677
00:39:57.045 --> 00:40:00.955
of God, but the more we understand the holiness

678
00:40:00.975 --> 00:40:05.315
and justice of God, the more it exalts his mercy to us,

679
00:40:05.415 --> 00:40:08.395
his grace to us, that he doesn't give us what we deserve.

680
00:40:08.415 --> 00:40:12.075
He gives us all these gifts, including salvation.

681
00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:16.555
We need to exalt that.

682
00:40:17.885 --> 00:40:20.955
Appreciate that respect, that honor that celebrate that

683
00:40:22.065 --> 00:40:25.755
because hear me, what that means is

684
00:40:25.755 --> 00:40:27.315
that if God could forgive David,

685
00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:33.615
he could forgive you for all that David did.

686
00:40:34.945 --> 00:40:37.405
If he could forgive David, he can forgive you.

687
00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:39.445
If God could still include David

688
00:40:39.665 --> 00:40:42.645
and Bathsheba in the lineage of the Messiah,

689
00:40:44.325 --> 00:40:46.305
he can take the ashes of your life

690
00:40:46.325 --> 00:40:47.825
and make something beautiful out of it.

691
00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:52.355
How do you do that? How do you get that

692
00:40:53.895 --> 00:40:55.195
as you run to the cross?

693
00:40:57.765 --> 00:40:59.625
That's how it happens. One John one, nine,

694
00:40:59.725 --> 00:41:02.025
if we confess our sins, he's faithful

695
00:41:02.025 --> 00:41:03.705
and just to forgive us our sins

696
00:41:03.705 --> 00:41:08.145
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, you go to God

697
00:41:08.145 --> 00:41:09.545
and say, God, I agree with you.

698
00:41:09.655 --> 00:41:11.145
That is sin. I need you

699
00:41:11.145 --> 00:41:13.905
to cleanse me from my unrighteousness.

700
00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:15.065
And here's what God does.

701
00:41:15.285 --> 00:41:19.425
He applies the blood of Christ to wash you clean.

702
00:41:19.615 --> 00:41:21.265
Like Isaiah one 18 says,

703
00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:23.105
come let us reason together, says the Lord.

704
00:41:23.165 --> 00:41:25.105
Though your sins are like scarlet,

705
00:41:25.215 --> 00:41:27.185
they shall be white as snow.

706
00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:28.625
Though they're red like crimson,

707
00:41:28.655 --> 00:41:31.105
they shall be become like wool.

708
00:41:32.085 --> 00:41:34.085
That's how God saves you in the first place

709
00:41:35.395 --> 00:41:37.245
that you are a sinner, separated from God,

710
00:41:37.255 --> 00:41:38.285
enemy of God dirty.

711
00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:41.835
He cleanses you, brings you into the family.

712
00:41:42.095 --> 00:41:46.915
But that's also how you keep fellowship with God.

713
00:41:47.295 --> 00:41:50.955
Day after day after day, you sin, you repent.

714
00:41:51.135 --> 00:41:53.715
He washes you clean, renews a right spirit within you.

715
00:41:53.895 --> 00:41:55.755
You sin. He cleans you.

716
00:41:55.895 --> 00:41:59.355
As you repent, washes you, gives you a right spirit,

717
00:41:59.975 --> 00:42:01.475
renews a clean all He.

718
00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:03.995
It's back and forth. It's what happens day

719
00:42:04.205 --> 00:42:05.835
after day after day.

720
00:42:08.475 --> 00:42:09.795
I know some of you walked in here today

721
00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:13.635
not feeling the joy of the Lord.

722
00:42:15.945 --> 00:42:18.045
You're not feeling the joy of your salvation.

723
00:42:18.055 --> 00:42:19.525
We're talking about it and singing about it

724
00:42:19.525 --> 00:42:21.605
and you're just like, well, it's kind of whatever.

725
00:42:24.415 --> 00:42:26.905
It's not this way every time, but it might be

726
00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:31.435
because you are harboring sin in your heart

727
00:42:32.215 --> 00:42:34.235
and you're not confessing it.

728
00:42:36.925 --> 00:42:39.625
And and David talks about it, eating up your bones

729
00:42:41.195 --> 00:42:44.615
as you don't confess, you hold it in.

730
00:42:45.395 --> 00:42:47.325
Like maybe you're just kind of apathetic about God.

731
00:42:47.325 --> 00:42:49.965
You're just like, whatever, I don't care. Kinda bored.

732
00:42:50.865 --> 00:42:54.895
It might be that you've got

733
00:42:55.085 --> 00:42:57.975
that closet in your heart stuffed full of junk

734
00:42:58.755 --> 00:42:59.855
and you need to clean it out.

735
00:43:03.935 --> 00:43:07.125
David wrote later in Psalm 32, how blessed it is

736
00:43:07.545 --> 00:43:11.835
to be forgiven, to feel forgiven, to know

737
00:43:11.835 --> 00:43:13.555
that you're washed clean before God.

738
00:43:13.585 --> 00:43:15.835
That is the greatest blessing.

739
00:43:16.015 --> 00:43:19.675
To have your sin covered, to have your, your sin covered

740
00:43:19.815 --> 00:43:21.515
and counted as nothing.

741
00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:23.675
That your spirit is no deceit.

742
00:43:24.045 --> 00:43:26.355
Confession is the key to unlock that.

743
00:43:28.935 --> 00:43:31.465
Like you want that right? You wanna feel free before God.

744
00:43:31.645 --> 00:43:35.705
That's how you get there. Confession and repentance

745
00:43:35.725 --> 00:43:39.945
and restoring, receiving the blood of Christ

746
00:43:40.205 --> 00:43:41.345
to wash you.

747
00:43:41.595 --> 00:43:43.785
Clean and hear me.

748
00:43:44.285 --> 00:43:48.065
It is a whole lot better to confess than it is to get caught

749
00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:52.725
to initiate and say, here's what I've been doing than

750
00:43:52.725 --> 00:43:55.205
to get caught and say, here's what you've been doing.

751
00:43:57.515 --> 00:43:59.145
Whole different response to those things.

752
00:44:03.335 --> 00:44:06.475
And so what wall does God want

753
00:44:06.475 --> 00:44:07.955
to break down in your heart today?

754
00:44:10.865 --> 00:44:15.085
How does he want to clean out the junk

755
00:44:15.115 --> 00:44:16.685
that you've just caught up?

756
00:44:17.025 --> 00:44:20.525
Let sit in there right now. How does he wanna do that today?

757
00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:25.855
And as we've been walking through this, it might feel

758
00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:28.455
to you that you're just shattered.

759
00:44:29.165 --> 00:44:31.485
Like you know what's in there, nobody else knows,

760
00:44:31.485 --> 00:44:33.645
but you know what's in there and you're just kinda wrecked,

761
00:44:33.835 --> 00:44:35.165
crushed over that.

762
00:44:35.185 --> 00:44:39.045
Listen to this. Remember Psalm 51, verse 17.

763
00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:42.365
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,

764
00:44:44.845 --> 00:44:46.565
a broken contrite heart.

765
00:44:46.625 --> 00:44:49.045
Oh God, you will not despise.

766
00:44:49.305 --> 00:44:51.085
That's fine if you feel broken.

767
00:44:52.705 --> 00:44:54.645
That's how he wants you to come to him.

768
00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:57.245
He doesn't care about the sacrifices of money and

769
00:44:57.385 --> 00:45:00.285
and singing and praying, like that's not the biggest thing.

770
00:45:00.315 --> 00:45:02.205
What he wants is your heart broken

771
00:45:02.225 --> 00:45:04.965
before him to say, I need you, God.

772
00:45:05.885 --> 00:45:08.285
I can't clean myself. I can't fix myself. I need you.

773
00:45:09.995 --> 00:45:11.415
He says, come to me

774
00:45:12.955 --> 00:45:14.935
All who are weary and burdened and I'll give you rest.

775
00:45:19.795 --> 00:45:22.855
Listen, sin is far more dangerous

776
00:45:22.925 --> 00:45:23.925
Than you may think.

777
00:45:27.195 --> 00:45:29.215
And God's justice Is

778
00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:31.735
Far more real Than you may think.

779
00:45:35.055 --> 00:45:38.795
But God's mercy is far more glorious

780
00:45:39.065 --> 00:45:43.345
Than you might think And succumb

781
00:45:43.565 --> 00:45:45.265
to the altar of Christ.

782
00:45:47.335 --> 00:45:50.625
Just come to the cleansing flood of Jesus,

783
00:45:50.795 --> 00:45:52.865
blood washing you clean.

784
00:45:53.045 --> 00:45:56.185
He shed it for you, and it washes over you

785
00:45:56.365 --> 00:45:57.465
and it makes you clean.

786
00:45:57.605 --> 00:46:00.465
It removes your sins. As far as the east is from the West.

787
00:46:00.565 --> 00:46:01.865
That's as far as you can go.

788
00:46:01.935 --> 00:46:04.585
It's impossible to get there from the other side.

789
00:46:04.935 --> 00:46:09.025
It's as if it's impossible to come back from.

790
00:46:10.165 --> 00:46:14.745
That's what he does when you come to him

791
00:46:16.015 --> 00:46:19.305
with a broken heart, humble spirit saying, God, I need you.

792
00:46:21.225 --> 00:46:23.905
I can't do it myself. I need you all that you did

793
00:46:23.925 --> 00:46:25.665
to count for me.

794
00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.105
And so for the rest of our time today,

795
00:46:30.615 --> 00:46:32.545
this area up here is open.

796
00:46:32.695 --> 00:46:35.265
This is not the altar we're telling you to come to.

797
00:46:35.265 --> 00:46:37.025
We're telling you to come to the altar of Christ,

798
00:46:38.405 --> 00:46:41.585
but there's something symbolic that it might be.

799
00:46:41.785 --> 00:46:42.825
I need to go kneel. I need

800
00:46:42.825 --> 00:46:44.025
to get a couple of friends with me.

801
00:46:44.025 --> 00:46:46.425
And we need to confess and talk and pray together

802
00:46:46.685 --> 00:46:48.505
and just say, God, I'm all in

803
00:46:50.885 --> 00:46:55.425
to lay it all down before the Lord, by yourself with a few.

804
00:46:57.485 --> 00:46:58.985
And listen, if there's something burdening your heart

805
00:46:59.005 --> 00:47:01.065
so much, we're gonna have prayer partners at the corners.

806
00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:02.505
So you can just come forward to the end

807
00:47:02.505 --> 00:47:03.585
and go over to the edge and

808
00:47:03.585 --> 00:47:04.545
there'll be people there to pray with

809
00:47:04.545 --> 00:47:05.105
you. If you need that,

810
00:47:05.845 --> 00:47:09.665
If Or just there at your seat, you run to the altar

811
00:47:10.005 --> 00:47:13.465
of Christ, maybe get on your knees there or whatever it is.

812
00:47:14.485 --> 00:47:15.785
You just want his forgiveness.

813
00:47:17.105 --> 00:47:18.665
'cause you know you're a sinner in need of it.

814
00:47:19.645 --> 00:47:21.465
That's what this is for today.

815
00:47:24.005 --> 00:47:26.985
And so, God, I pray You continue

816
00:47:26.985 --> 00:47:28.465
to stir our hearts towards you in this.

817
00:47:29.235 --> 00:47:32.685
Lead us in the way everlasting. Show us where we are again.

818
00:47:34.425 --> 00:47:36.405
So far from your standard.

819
00:47:36.465 --> 00:47:37.965
We fall short of the glory of God

820
00:47:39.705 --> 00:47:41.125
and the wages of sin is death,

821
00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:42.845
but the gift of God is eternal life

822
00:47:42.845 --> 00:47:43.965
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

823
00:47:45.945 --> 00:47:48.085
So give us faith to come to you today.

824
00:47:48.405 --> 00:47:50.205
Whatever that looks like, however we respond in that, Lord,

825
00:47:50.205 --> 00:47:53.205
just lead us out of the darkness into the light.

826
00:47:53.235 --> 00:47:56.285
Help us today. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.

827
00:47:56.285 --> 00:47:58.365
If you're able to stand together and respond.
