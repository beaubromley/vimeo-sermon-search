00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:20.055
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:23.655
It is great to gather together like this every week.

3
00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:25.495
Uh, my name's John. I'm one of the pastors here.

4
00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:26.615
I get to preach most of the time.

5
00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:28.335
If I haven't met you yet, I'd love

6
00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:29.455
to meet you sometime soon.

7
00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.495
So just come say hi. When you see me.

8
00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:33.055
Today's a really special day.

9
00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:35.015
We are kicking off a new sermon series,

10
00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:36.935
and we're gonna walk through the book

11
00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:40.455
of Second Samuel over the next couple months.

12
00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.655
Last fall and spring, we walked

13
00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:45.135
through the book of First Samuel.

14
00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:47.135
And so that began the story.

15
00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:49.815
Now we're going to kind of continue the story

16
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.295
through the book of Second Samuel.

17
00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:55.135
Last week, Aaron, well reminded us that really the whole

18
00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:58.575
story has been about God's people

19
00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:01.535
abandoning God as their king.

20
00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:04.695
Uh, that's really the whole genesis of the story, is

21
00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:07.175
that they were searching instead of following God,

22
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.815
they were searching for an earthly king,

23
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.255
and that has not gone well for them.

24
00:01:11.515 --> 00:01:13.015
And so they did that.

25
00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:16.015
That was really the premise of it was who shall reign?

26
00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:17.095
It really should be God.

27
00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:19.655
But the, the secondary question with that was then, well,

28
00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:21.415
okay, if they're searching for an earthly king,

29
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.535
who's gonna be that king?

30
00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:25.375
And then it was the process of figuring out

31
00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:30.375
who God had promised this type of man to lead the country,

32
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:32.135
but they had to figure out who that was.

33
00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:34.415
And so we showed this chart, maybe some

34
00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:37.655
of you remember this throughout the whole of First Samuel,

35
00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:39.855
and we tracked how that played out.

36
00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:42.935
And so we saw the transition from judges to kings,

37
00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:45.375
and then how the development happened

38
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.095
where the first king was Saul.

39
00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:48.455
And he looked the part head

40
00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:49.975
and shoulders above every handsome, right?

41
00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:52.855
He's the guy. And he, he seemed like he would be the one,

42
00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:55.815
but his heart was not close to God.

43
00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:58.135
And so God had promised a man

44
00:01:58.135 --> 00:01:59.575
after God's own heart to lead his people.

45
00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:03.335
And that transition from Saul then to David, God,

46
00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:05.655
anointed David to replace Saul.

47
00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:08.695
Well, second Samuel, that was first Samuel.

48
00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.935
Second Samuel is David's rise to the throne.

49
00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:15.255
How he steps into that role, and then how he handles it

50
00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:17.935
after he steps into that role.

51
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:20.535
We're gonna use another chart for second Samuel.

52
00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:22.415
So you might take a picture of this now.

53
00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:24.535
We'll have it up every week at some point, usually.

54
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:26.735
So, uh, you'll see this a couple times,

55
00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.575
but it's gonna be the rise and fall of David.

56
00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:32.695
Now, the idea is yes, we're gonna learn

57
00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.255
that David was God's promised king for Israel.

58
00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.895
He was the one. But

59
00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:41.145
we'll also see that David was limited.

60
00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:43.385
He was the promised king.

61
00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:46.065
But limited in that role,

62
00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:48.815
there's gonna be a rise to the throne.

63
00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:52.535
Yes, there will be, uh, David's, uh, process

64
00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:54.895
of becoming the greatest King Israel ever had.

65
00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:59.365
But then there's also gonna be faults of David along the way

66
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:03.765
and the consequences that come from those faults.

67
00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.125
See, David is not always the hero

68
00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:09.125
that we make him out to be.

69
00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:13.245
In fact, there's some pretty serious issues,

70
00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:16.005
which really may.

71
00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:17.685
It means something that we need

72
00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:19.925
to set up right here at the beginning of the whole series.

73
00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:23.965
This is something we won't forget, can't forget, is

74
00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:27.645
that David is merely a pointer

75
00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:30.125
to the true promise king.

76
00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:33.445
He's the promise king that, that Israel needed.

77
00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:37.245
But, but he's really just pointing us forward to the true

78
00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:41.045
promised King whose name is Jesus.

79
00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:43.845
That's really what the whole book is about.

80
00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.085
So in one sense, we'll see second Samuel's,

81
00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:48.965
like David's testimony, his successes, his failures,

82
00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:50.645
his experiences of God's grace.

83
00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:53.285
That's a great picture for us to learn from.

84
00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:57.205
But it's also the main point how all of that

85
00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:00.205
points us to the Lord.

86
00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:02.605
And so don't forget that as we go through it.

87
00:04:02.605 --> 00:04:04.205
That's why I want to begin just by praying

88
00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:07.005
for this whole series that we're gonna set a tone for this.

89
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:09.605
We're gonna ask the Lord to bless it, give his his power

90
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:13.165
as we walk through this power, this passage of scripture.

91
00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:16.325
So, Lord, thank you for the opportunity to study

92
00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:18.365
through your word.

93
00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:21.085
And and we don't, we don't know.

94
00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:25.855
We don't think this is merely man's words.

95
00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:31.335
This is your word. And we know that with that

96
00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:36.585
Holy Spirit, you empower your word.

97
00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:39.985
You highlight, you exalt your word.

98
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:42.745
And so God, as as we study it over the next couple months,

99
00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.705
this unique book of Second Samuel Lord, use it to teach us,

100
00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:48.185
use it to change our hearts and,

101
00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:50.985
and move us forward to be more like you.

102
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:56.145
As we look to the true promised King that we celebrate

103
00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:59.235
and worship every week, help us God.

104
00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.715
It's gotta be your work. It's not mine.

105
00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:04.115
Get us outta the way. Remove distractions that we can see

106
00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:06.835
what you want us to see in Jesus' name.

107
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:11.125
Amen. And so I invite you now to turn in your copy

108
00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:16.045
of God's word to Second Samuel early in the Old Testament.

109
00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:16.965
You just start from the beginning.

110
00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:18.125
You start flipping back a little bit.

111
00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:22.045
You'll find second Samuel, uh, put a bookmark there

112
00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:24.405
or your, your little ribbon in your Bible

113
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:26.725
because we'll be there every week as we walk

114
00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:30.605
through this narrative, as you turn there.

115
00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:32.165
It might seem like as we walk through this,

116
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.485
that we're taking really big chunks of scripture.

117
00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.125
And and that's partly true because we'll take it two

118
00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.085
or three chapters at a time sometimes.

119
00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:42.125
And, and that can seem overwhelming.

120
00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.045
But the reality is that's just narrative.

121
00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:47.125
That's just the, the nature of this. You, you have a story.

122
00:05:48.105 --> 00:05:50.365
You can't break it up into little sections

123
00:05:50.365 --> 00:05:51.765
or you lose the point of the story.

124
00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:56.125
So we have to take bigger sections to understand the point

125
00:05:56.715 --> 00:05:58.925
that God was trying to reveal here.

126
00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:01.205
So for example, today we're gonna look at chapters one

127
00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:04.325
through three, three chapters of two Samuel

128
00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:06.485
because part of it recaps

129
00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:08.365
what we already saw at the end of one Samuel.

130
00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.405
And the rest of it sets up David to be the king

131
00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:13.365
that we need.

132
00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:17.215
It sets up David, not just as the king,

133
00:06:17.235 --> 00:06:20.975
but also the kind of king that God wanted

134
00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:22.335
for his people.

135
00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:25.335
Not a king who would seize power by violence

136
00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:28.415
or manipulation, but one whose integrity would

137
00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:29.535
shine really brightly.

138
00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:31.655
That's what he was saying through these couple chapters.

139
00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:34.815
God, this God's saying to us, this is the kind of man

140
00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:37.055
that I want to be the king.

141
00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:39.535
And we'll see that in David in these chapters.

142
00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:42.615
How he responds to Saul's death. That's a big test for him.

143
00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:46.095
But also the division we see among God's people.

144
00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:47.495
There's a big test there.

145
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.095
And again, all of it will point us forward

146
00:06:50.115 --> 00:06:52.055
to the true king Jesus.

147
00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:55.815
And so let's look now Second Samuel chapter one.

148
00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:57.855
Again, I can't read all three chapters,

149
00:06:57.855 --> 00:06:58.895
we just don't have enough time for that.

150
00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:00.815
But I'm gonna give you highlights, summary statements,

151
00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:03.935
dive into critical pieces of it and,

152
00:07:03.995 --> 00:07:06.535
and walk through the story so we're not missing anything.

153
00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:08.655
And so what wrap, what happens right outta the gate here

154
00:07:09.435 --> 00:07:13.335
and is, is the parallel account of Saul's death.

155
00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:15.855
The King of Israel has died.

156
00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:18.575
One Samuel 31 was, was the actual story

157
00:07:18.635 --> 00:07:20.695
of Saul dying in the battle scene.

158
00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:22.775
Here. It's David's account.

159
00:07:22.795 --> 00:07:26.095
And, and David's experience at the same parallel time.

160
00:07:26.615 --> 00:07:28.175
'cause what was happening, a big battle

161
00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:29.175
with the Philistines.

162
00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:32.535
These people are trying to overtake Israel.

163
00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:34.175
David's in a different part of the country.

164
00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:37.855
And Saul and his son, Jonathan, who was David's best friend,

165
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.375
by the way, they were in the battle

166
00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:41.735
and they ended up dying in the battle.

167
00:07:43.175 --> 00:07:44.265
Well, here's what happens. One

168
00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:47.985
of the servants from Saul's camp who was an amalekite,

169
00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:50.265
which is one of the defeated enemies of God's people,

170
00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:51.825
he comes to David

171
00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:56.545
and says, Hey David, listen, I'm, I'm telling you some news

172
00:07:57.085 --> 00:07:58.865
you need to know Saul's died.

173
00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:01.505
'cause David didn't know there wasn't Snapchat

174
00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:03.025
or Twitter or anything like that.

175
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:04.425
It was just like David needed to find out.

176
00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:07.105
Some guy shows up and says, Hey, Saul is dead.

177
00:08:07.285 --> 00:08:08.545
Now here's the thing about this guy.

178
00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:10.225
He wanted to impress David.

179
00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:14.785
He was certain in his mind that David would love

180
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:18.465
to hear the fact that Saul, his, his enemy, had died.

181
00:08:19.685 --> 00:08:22.705
And so this man walks in, says, Hey David,

182
00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:24.145
listen, Saul's dead.

183
00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:26.505
I got him. I killed him.

184
00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:33.245
Now that's different than what we read in one Samuel 31.

185
00:08:34.075 --> 00:08:36.565
It's a dis, it's distinct from that

186
00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:39.325
because what we read in that is that Saul was

187
00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:41.765
so badly wounded that he had fell on his own sword

188
00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:43.045
and died in the battle.

189
00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:45.325
And so this man walks in this am Malachi

190
00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:46.805
and says, Hey, I killed him.

191
00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:51.425
He's lying in order to curry favor

192
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.785
with the new king.

193
00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:57.165
Maybe he'll give me a a position in his new

194
00:08:57.165 --> 00:08:58.325
kingdom or something like that.

195
00:08:58.585 --> 00:09:03.485
We don't know. But he's clearly lying to impress the king.

196
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:08.385
Well watch how David responded to the news.

197
00:09:09.695 --> 00:09:12.305
This man came and said, Hey, I got Saul. He's dead.

198
00:09:12.545 --> 00:09:15.185
I did it. Aren't you proud?

199
00:09:15.275 --> 00:09:19.105
Watch David's response verses 11 and 12 here in chapter one.

200
00:09:21.005 --> 00:09:23.975
Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them.

201
00:09:23.975 --> 00:09:25.255
That's a sign of grief.

202
00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:28.855
And so did all the men who were with him and they mourned

203
00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:32.135
and wept and fasted until evening for Saul

204
00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:34.935
and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the Lord

205
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.215
and for the house of Israel

206
00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:38.575
because they had fallen by the sword.

207
00:09:41.085 --> 00:09:44.525
Now, don't forget who Saul was.

208
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.525
Saul was the man who had multiple times tried to kill David.

209
00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:52.745
He'd hunted him like a wild animal.

210
00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:55.905
He had kept him on the run for 10 years. This was the man.

211
00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:59.595
Saul was the man that we see.

212
00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:01.795
David's heart show up.

213
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.355
Saul was the man that David was

214
00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:08.145
grieving for his loss.

215
00:10:08.985 --> 00:10:10.795
Instead of hatred, there was grief.

216
00:10:10.905 --> 00:10:14.035
Instead of rejoicing over his enemy's death,

217
00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:15.395
there was mourning.

218
00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:22.335
David grieved the loss of God's anointed king that Saul was.

219
00:10:25.035 --> 00:10:27.135
He even wrote a song of lament.

220
00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:29.415
David wrote most of the Psalms, you can go through

221
00:10:29.415 --> 00:10:30.575
and find his name on a lot of those.

222
00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:33.375
He wrote a song of lament to be sung

223
00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:35.815
by God's people over the loss of Saul

224
00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:38.295
and Jonathan, we find it here in chapter one,

225
00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:39.695
verses 19 through 27.

226
00:10:39.995 --> 00:10:41.655
You can read the whole thing. I'm just gonna read a

227
00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:42.695
couple pieces to show you.

228
00:10:42.915 --> 00:10:44.855
It says verse 19, your glory,

229
00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:47.135
Israel is slain on your high places.

230
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.535
How the mighty have fallen.

231
00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:52.655
Verse 23, Saul and Jonathan, beloved

232
00:10:52.675 --> 00:10:54.175
and lovely in life and death.

233
00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:56.815
They were not divided. They were swifter than eagles,

234
00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:58.455
stronger than lions.

235
00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.695
He's upholding them. Verse 27, how the mighty have fallen

236
00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:04.135
and the weapons of war perished.

237
00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:10.035
So he wrote a song, uh, of grief for the nation to sing.

238
00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:17.515
Not only that, watch how he responded to the amalekite man

239
00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:19.955
who came and told him about Saul's death.

240
00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:22.395
Look at verses 14 through 16.

241
00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:29.295
David said to him, how is it you were not afraid

242
00:11:29.315 --> 00:11:31.935
to put out your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?

243
00:11:33.455 --> 00:11:34.945
Then David called one of the young men

244
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.385
and said, go execute him.

245
00:11:36.885 --> 00:11:38.745
And he struck him down so that he died.

246
00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:41.325
And David said to the amalekite, man,

247
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:42.925
your blood be on your head

248
00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:45.765
for your own mouth has testified against you saying,

249
00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:47.845
I have killed the Lord's anointed.

250
00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:52.385
He had the man who claimed to have killed Saul.

251
00:11:52.385 --> 00:11:56.635
He had him executed right like

252
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.825
This man, this Amalekite man should have recognized the

253
00:12:02.905 --> 00:12:05.225
sanctity of God's anointed king.

254
00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:10.315
He should have been terrified to touch him

255
00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:12.235
because remember that's what David did when David was

256
00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:14.315
fleeing from Saul had multiple chances

257
00:12:14.315 --> 00:12:17.195
to take Saul out instead of Saul trying to kill him.

258
00:12:17.415 --> 00:12:20.005
He didn't. He said, no, no,

259
00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.365
I'm not gonna touch the Lord's anointed.

260
00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:22.685
He repeated that multiple times.

261
00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:24.805
I'm not touching the Lord's anointed.

262
00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:28.085
I'm not going to gain the throne improperly.

263
00:12:28.385 --> 00:12:30.645
God promised it to me. I'm not gonna do it myself.

264
00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:32.525
I'm going to allow God to do it.

265
00:12:32.675 --> 00:12:35.645
This Amalekite man said a whole different mindset.

266
00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.205
He's like, I'm gonna manipulate this whole situation

267
00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:39.285
to my ends.

268
00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:43.345
And what happened? He paid the ultimate price.

269
00:12:47.085 --> 00:12:52.025
So here's the point. David revealed his heart in his

270
00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:53.945
response to Saul's death.

271
00:12:55.205 --> 00:12:56.265
That's what we see here.

272
00:12:59.095 --> 00:13:03.445
David revealed his passionate love for God,

273
00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:05.605
a man after God's own heart.

274
00:13:05.695 --> 00:13:08.725
David revealed that here by the way.

275
00:13:08.825 --> 00:13:11.245
He responded to his enemy,

276
00:13:11.675 --> 00:13:16.675
Saul dying 'cause he

277
00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:20.575
Think about it. He could have rejoiced that. Saul's gone.

278
00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:24.335
My opponent is gone. The pathway to the throne is clear.

279
00:13:24.475 --> 00:13:27.815
Now I got this. I'm king. Now it's clear.

280
00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:29.015
But he doesn't do that.

281
00:13:33.535 --> 00:13:36.045
Which leads us to a question for us today.

282
00:13:38.155 --> 00:13:40.935
Is that how you love your enemies?

283
00:13:46.215 --> 00:13:50.345
Like do you grieve when your enemy suffers?

284
00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:58.015
If your opponent or the antagonist in your life dies?

285
00:13:58.715 --> 00:14:00.695
Do you mourn for their death?

286
00:14:01.355 --> 00:14:05.455
Or are you more apt

287
00:14:05.455 --> 00:14:07.455
to throw a party like, man, they deserve it.

288
00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:08.815
They got what they deserve. Finally,

289
00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:15.295
and listen, we saw this as we studied Romans 12 this summer,

290
00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:20.715
one of the most challenging realignment statements in

291
00:14:20.715 --> 00:14:24.265
Romans 12 verses 19 and 20.

292
00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.785
Beloved never avenge yourselves,

293
00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:30.155
but leave it to the wrath of God.

294
00:14:30.615 --> 00:14:32.475
For it is written, vengeance is mine,

295
00:14:32.675 --> 00:14:34.275
I will repay, says the Lord.

296
00:14:35.485 --> 00:14:38.305
To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

297
00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:42.995
If he's thirsty, giving something to drink for, by so doing,

298
00:14:42.995 --> 00:14:45.435
you will heap burning coals on his head.

299
00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:49.845
It doesn't say if he's hungry, laugh at him.

300
00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:52.765
If he's thirsty, keep pushing him further away.

301
00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:55.085
No, it says you provide,

302
00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:59.905
you love them Again.

303
00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:01.865
Remember, David had multiple opportunities

304
00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:05.185
to take out his enemy to kill Saul, but he didn't do it

305
00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:10.555
'cause he trusted that God's justice is perfect.

306
00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:14.675
Our revenge is never perfect.

307
00:15:16.435 --> 00:15:17.855
We don't know the situation fully.

308
00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:19.975
We will not do it rightly

309
00:15:20.875 --> 00:15:22.575
and we'll be guilty on the other side of it.

310
00:15:22.675 --> 00:15:26.815
So David trusted God to deal with the situation.

311
00:15:27.395 --> 00:15:29.615
And you know what? It ended up actually way better

312
00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:32.135
for David than if he had taken Saul out

313
00:15:32.135 --> 00:15:33.415
some other way, some other time.

314
00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:34.855
It ended up better for David

315
00:15:35.375 --> 00:15:37.455
'cause no one could accuse David of anything.

316
00:15:37.475 --> 00:15:40.215
At this point. He's in a

317
00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:41.375
whole different part of the country.

318
00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:43.615
He had no knowledge of it even happening.

319
00:15:43.915 --> 00:15:46.655
And now David is the king.

320
00:15:48.595 --> 00:15:50.895
His hands were clean. Why?

321
00:15:50.895 --> 00:15:53.615
Because of Romans 12, that mentality.

322
00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:56.295
He said, I'm gonna overcome evil with good.

323
00:15:57.505 --> 00:15:59.085
I'm not gonna, like Martin Luther King Jr.

324
00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:00.685
Said, I'm not gonna overcome evil with evil

325
00:16:00.845 --> 00:16:01.885
'cause that just multiplies evil.

326
00:16:03.315 --> 00:16:04.575
I'm gonna overcome evil with good.

327
00:16:07.865 --> 00:16:10.655
And we see the result. And

328
00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:11.775
so let's just play this out for us.

329
00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:17.475
If, if that attitude is true of us, if that's commanded

330
00:16:17.475 --> 00:16:17.915
of us,

331
00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:25.075
Don't you think that should mean our lives look pretty

332
00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:28.575
different Than the way of the world, even than

333
00:16:28.575 --> 00:16:29.615
what they commonly do.

334
00:16:30.765 --> 00:16:32.385
It means things should be very different in

335
00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:35.265
how we speak about those who oppose us, those

336
00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:38.425
who are considered enemies, those are antagonizing us.

337
00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:39.985
We should speak differently about them.

338
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:43.345
Our social media usage should be very different in the way

339
00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:44.345
we speak about people.

340
00:16:44.655 --> 00:16:47.745
That way our bumper stickers on our car should not be just

341
00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:48.945
like everybody else's in the world.

342
00:16:51.285 --> 00:16:54.505
If this is the mentality, if Jesus said to love your enemies

343
00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:58.785
and to pray for those who persecute you, we should refuse

344
00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:01.385
to rejoice when someone on the other side

345
00:17:01.385 --> 00:17:03.225
of the aisle suffers.

346
00:17:05.465 --> 00:17:07.685
We should be radically different in the way we treat

347
00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:08.965
those who oppose us.

348
00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:14.765
Now, I'm not saying we trust those people,

349
00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:20.855
but I am saying we ought to speak as well as we can of them.

350
00:17:21.885 --> 00:17:25.095
Even if they've hurt us, we should try to honor

351
00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:28.175
what we can in that image bearer of God like we are.

352
00:17:28.435 --> 00:17:31.775
And yes, we don't give everything away to them,

353
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.695
but despite their failures toward us,

354
00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:35.575
if Jesus looked at his enemies

355
00:17:35.575 --> 00:17:38.375
and said, father, forgive them, we can do the same.

356
00:17:41.905 --> 00:17:43.565
That's what David models so well.

357
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.805
His heart was so in love with God

358
00:17:45.805 --> 00:17:48.565
that he could love his enemy, by grieving his enemy's death,

359
00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:54.745
by honoring him through a song.

360
00:17:55.415 --> 00:17:56.905
This man who persecuted him.

361
00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:02.975
I mean, that's the kind of king that God wanted, right?

362
00:18:05.005 --> 00:18:08.575
It's a good king. So

363
00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:10.295
that's one aspect of his qualifications.

364
00:18:10.295 --> 00:18:13.575
Here's another In this chapters two

365
00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:14.935
and three, we start to see

366
00:18:15.645 --> 00:18:18.335
some things show up in David again that adds

367
00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:19.535
to the qualifications again.

368
00:18:19.645 --> 00:18:23.095
When Saul died, it seemed like now there's a clear path

369
00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:26.775
to the throne like David, man, it's yours now.

370
00:18:26.775 --> 00:18:31.055
Everything is good except for like the uh,

371
00:18:31.135 --> 00:18:33.335
legend once said, not so fast my friend.

372
00:18:36.775 --> 00:18:38.205
We're gonna throw the chart back up there

373
00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:39.805
and you'll see it on the left.

374
00:18:39.815 --> 00:18:44.045
David was immediately anointed king of Judah,

375
00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:48.505
which was only one of the 12 tribes of Israel.

376
00:18:49.685 --> 00:18:52.465
And then you see that he moved to Hebron,

377
00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:54.425
which is a small town in the south.

378
00:18:54.455 --> 00:18:57.505
It's not Jerusalem, which is eventually going to be the,

379
00:18:57.565 --> 00:19:00.145
the the capital that we will find out, of course.

380
00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:02.505
But he's in Hebron. He's down in the middle of nowhere.

381
00:19:02.895 --> 00:19:04.825
King of just one of the 12 tribes.

382
00:19:05.795 --> 00:19:06.965
Because here's what happened.

383
00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:12.005
Abner, who is the commander of Saul's army,

384
00:19:13.995 --> 00:19:16.145
Abner, took one of Saul's other sons

385
00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:17.145
who didn't die in the battle.

386
00:19:17.485 --> 00:19:19.185
His name was ish Boche,

387
00:19:19.595 --> 00:19:21.345
which is not on the top 10 baby names.

388
00:19:21.465 --> 00:19:23.545
I don't know why, but ish Boche,

389
00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:28.685
He took that son and said, you're the king.

390
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:32.405
Your dad was Saul, you're the king of these tribes.

391
00:19:32.785 --> 00:19:34.045
All of Israel. 11.

392
00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:38.565
Well, David's over here, king of one tribe, Judah,

393
00:19:38.565 --> 00:19:39.685
which is really small too.

394
00:19:39.705 --> 00:19:41.685
And him and Joab, his military commander,

395
00:19:41.685 --> 00:19:43.125
they're over here doing this and Israel chef

396
00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:44.765
and Abner over here doing this.

397
00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:47.605
It, it starts to smell like civil war, doesn't it?

398
00:19:49.485 --> 00:19:52.425
And, and things are starting to heat up a little bit here

399
00:19:53.015 --> 00:19:54.585
that, that Abner didn't like David.

400
00:19:54.605 --> 00:19:56.465
And so he's like, I'm gonna make Raeth the king

401
00:19:56.465 --> 00:19:57.825
and this is what's gonna look now.

402
00:20:00.415 --> 00:20:05.225
Well it was clearly a case of human, human intuition.

403
00:20:05.315 --> 00:20:08.225
Human wisdom versus divine appointment.

404
00:20:09.035 --> 00:20:12.785
David anointed by God as the king

405
00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:14.705
Abner says, no, no, no.

406
00:20:15.285 --> 00:20:19.905
Eth gonna be the king. Well watch what happens.

407
00:20:20.175 --> 00:20:21.305
Look at chapter three.

408
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:26.185
Skip ahead a little bit to chapter three verse one.

409
00:20:29.165 --> 00:20:31.515
We're gonna see the results of that as we go.

410
00:20:31.925 --> 00:20:33.995
We're skipping a lot of the battles that happened.

411
00:20:33.995 --> 00:20:35.995
But watch this verse one of chapter three.

412
00:20:36.925 --> 00:20:38.555
There was a long war between the house

413
00:20:38.555 --> 00:20:39.635
of Saul and the house of David.

414
00:20:40.015 --> 00:20:41.635
And David grew stronger

415
00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:45.595
and stronger while the house of Saul became weaker

416
00:20:45.855 --> 00:20:50.205
and weaker Even

417
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:55.135
through a battle, God was fulfilling his promise to David

418
00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:58.415
to shift the kingdom to David.

419
00:20:59.655 --> 00:21:03.475
It was happening. God was bringing about the fulfillment

420
00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.555
of his promise.

421
00:21:04.615 --> 00:21:06.475
But here's what's interesting about how this played out.

422
00:21:08.425 --> 00:21:12.275
What happened next is that Abner who was with the 11 tribes

423
00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:16.755
and with the king, he anointed, he actually defects

424
00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:17.955
and changes his mind

425
00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:19.755
because of something the is Israel did to him.

426
00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:21.115
He changed his mind and said, no,

427
00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:22.635
I'm following David now he defects

428
00:21:22.635 --> 00:21:24.595
and comes over to follow David

429
00:21:24.695 --> 00:21:29.075
and all the 11 tribes begin to trickle alongside with him.

430
00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:30.795
We'll see that over the next couple chapters.

431
00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:35.155
But there was a problem. Abner was the enemy

432
00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:39.275
military commander, David's commander Joe AB was not

433
00:21:39.475 --> 00:21:40.475
involved in those conversations.

434
00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:43.555
Joe AB has no idea this is happening.

435
00:21:44.145 --> 00:21:45.395
He's out doing the work

436
00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:50.545
and he comes home, watch what he thought was happening.

437
00:21:50.975 --> 00:21:53.825
This is verses 22 through 25

438
00:21:55.085 --> 00:21:58.815
of chapter three Starting verse 22.

439
00:21:58.885 --> 00:22:00.855
Just then the service of David arrived

440
00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:03.975
with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them.

441
00:22:03.995 --> 00:22:06.655
But Abner was not with David at Hebron. He'd sent him away.

442
00:22:06.885 --> 00:22:08.775
He'd gone in peace when Job

443
00:22:08.835 --> 00:22:12.975
and all the army with him came, it was told Joab, Abner, son

444
00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:13.975
of Ner came to the king.

445
00:22:14.485 --> 00:22:15.975
He's let him go, he's gone in peace.

446
00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:18.825
And then Joab went to the king and said, what have you done?

447
00:22:20.355 --> 00:22:21.615
The old Abner came to you.

448
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.775
Why is it that you sent him away so that he's gone?

449
00:22:23.795 --> 00:22:26.295
You know, Abner, the son of Ner came to deceive you

450
00:22:27.235 --> 00:22:28.335
and to know you're going out.

451
00:22:28.335 --> 00:22:31.175
You're coming in and to know all that you are doing.

452
00:22:31.595 --> 00:22:33.935
Now here's a little side note, why would Abner not?

453
00:22:34.365 --> 00:22:36.175
Well Joe Ab not trust Abner, partly

454
00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:37.735
'cause he was on the other side, but also

455
00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:42.135
Abner had killed Joe Abs brother in a battle earlier.

456
00:22:43.435 --> 00:22:45.895
So there was already personal

457
00:22:46.215 --> 00:22:47.655
animosity between the two of them.

458
00:22:48.955 --> 00:22:52.215
And Job's like, dude, listen, he David, he's coming to try

459
00:22:52.215 --> 00:22:53.215
to figure out our plans.

460
00:22:53.645 --> 00:22:55.495
He's deceiving. You don't trust him.

461
00:22:58.625 --> 00:23:03.435
Well watch how Joab handled this situation verses 26

462
00:23:03.455 --> 00:23:07.845
and 27, when Joab came out from God's,

463
00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:10.645
from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner

464
00:23:10.645 --> 00:23:12.485
and they brought him back from the cistern of Sarah.

465
00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:15.405
But David did not know about this.

466
00:23:16.185 --> 00:23:18.195
And When Abner returned to he

467
00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:20.315
and Joab took him aside in the midst of the gate

468
00:23:20.335 --> 00:23:21.675
to speak with him privately.

469
00:23:21.855 --> 00:23:24.915
And there he struck him in the stomach so that he died

470
00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:27.835
for the blood of Asel, his brother.

471
00:23:32.485 --> 00:23:35.695
This is a test for David, isn't it?

472
00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:43.155
You've got division among the people, you've got conflict

473
00:23:43.365 --> 00:23:44.395
among his leaders.

474
00:23:46.365 --> 00:23:50.295
It's a test of David as the new king.

475
00:23:52.285 --> 00:23:55.575
Plus you have not only the divisions, you have this murder.

476
00:23:55.715 --> 00:23:58.055
Now that it could have come back on David,

477
00:23:58.325 --> 00:24:00.375
that he manipulated the enemy's death.

478
00:24:00.475 --> 00:24:03.135
He brought Abner in here, he deceived him

479
00:24:03.135 --> 00:24:04.975
and then sent Joe AB to go finish the job.

480
00:24:05.005 --> 00:24:07.375
Like no, he, he could have been read that way.

481
00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:10.725
If it's not that at,

482
00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:13.445
at the very least it's you got a general murdering another

483
00:24:13.445 --> 00:24:16.765
general, like that's not so it's a problem.

484
00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:20.565
It's a test. How was David gonna lead through the crisis?

485
00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:24.585
Watch verse 28.

486
00:24:26.785 --> 00:24:29.035
Afterward when David heard of it, he said,

487
00:24:29.315 --> 00:24:31.795
I in my kingdom are forever guiltless

488
00:24:31.855 --> 00:24:34.755
before the Lord for the blood of Abner, the son of Ner.

489
00:24:35.385 --> 00:24:39.875
Like he publicly disavowed anything, any involvement.

490
00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:42.235
He didn't have anything to do with this.

491
00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:45.915
Even the next verse, he calls down a curse on Joab

492
00:24:45.915 --> 00:24:48.155
because Joab took vengeance he shouldn't have.

493
00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:52.585
David says, I didn't do it, Joab did it and he was wrong.

494
00:24:56.005 --> 00:24:58.425
Now verses 31 and 32, watch.

495
00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:01.145
And then David said to Joab

496
00:25:01.145 --> 00:25:03.625
and to all the people who were with him, tear your clothes

497
00:25:03.645 --> 00:25:06.945
and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner

498
00:25:06.965 --> 00:25:08.865
and King David followed the beer.

499
00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:10.385
That's the the coffin.

500
00:25:10.735 --> 00:25:13.825
They buried Abner at Hebron and the king lifted up his voice

501
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:17.985
and wept at the grave of Abner and all the people wept.

502
00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:20.425
This sounds familiar, doesn't it?

503
00:25:22.455 --> 00:25:27.005
It's what he did with Saul enemy number one. Saul.

504
00:25:27.455 --> 00:25:28.765
David grieved him.

505
00:25:29.255 --> 00:25:31.285
Abner was on the other side with Saul

506
00:25:31.545 --> 00:25:35.945
and he grieved abner's loss publicly.

507
00:25:39.425 --> 00:25:40.485
And now verse 35.

508
00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:44.975
And then all the people came to persuade David

509
00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:46.575
to eat bread while it was yet day.

510
00:25:46.575 --> 00:25:48.735
But David swore saying, God do so to me

511
00:25:48.735 --> 00:25:50.455
and more also if I taste bread

512
00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:52.935
or anything else till the sun goes down.

513
00:25:53.475 --> 00:25:54.895
That's just signs of grief.

514
00:25:55.605 --> 00:25:59.415
He's lamenting fasting publicly saying You should be

515
00:25:59.655 --> 00:26:01.135
grieving the loss of Abner too.

516
00:26:05.055 --> 00:26:06.435
So he's again, showing his heart.

517
00:26:06.655 --> 00:26:07.955
But watch what all that did.

518
00:26:07.955 --> 00:26:09.715
Here's why I went through this watch

519
00:26:09.715 --> 00:26:12.195
what happens next verses 36 and 37,

520
00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:17.555
and all the people took notice of it

521
00:26:18.255 --> 00:26:21.445
and it pleased them as everything

522
00:26:21.445 --> 00:26:22.765
that the king did, pleased all the people.

523
00:26:23.065 --> 00:26:25.685
So all the people of and all Israel understood that day.

524
00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:28.805
It had not been the king's will to put to death.

525
00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:31.125
Abner, the son of Ner.

526
00:26:33.265 --> 00:26:37.815
Like you see what happened, David, in his transparent

527
00:26:38.445 --> 00:26:40.455
integrity filled leadership,

528
00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:42.695
he won the hearts of the people.

529
00:26:44.715 --> 00:26:47.045
Like, no, no, David didn't do that. That was Joab.

530
00:26:48.205 --> 00:26:51.425
We love David. We trust David. Watch how he's responded.

531
00:26:52.335 --> 00:26:54.075
It won the people's hearts.

532
00:26:54.095 --> 00:26:56.075
You see why God could trust David

533
00:26:56.905 --> 00:26:58.435
with the kingship of his people.

534
00:26:59.705 --> 00:27:01.405
His heart was close to God, he was wanting

535
00:27:01.405 --> 00:27:03.605
to do all the right things in every situation.

536
00:27:03.895 --> 00:27:07.805
David led through division, he led

537
00:27:07.805 --> 00:27:09.775
with integrity like that.

538
00:27:09.775 --> 00:27:13.905
That's the point here. Even through division, the chaos

539
00:27:15.495 --> 00:27:18.345
murders and, and people divided and,

540
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:20.345
and tribes splitting up like all of this.

541
00:27:20.395 --> 00:27:23.065
David was like, I, I have integrity

542
00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:26.505
and I'm going to lead with it through all of that.

543
00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:35.565
Now, what is integrity? Basic

544
00:27:35.565 --> 00:27:39.645
answer, integrity is when your private life matches

545
00:27:40.355 --> 00:27:44.935
your public testimony, the way you think and live

546
00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:47.375
and act inside yourself matches the way

547
00:27:47.685 --> 00:27:49.375
that you act publicly.

548
00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:54.335
You're the same in every situation. Is that true of you?

549
00:27:58.455 --> 00:28:00.315
And and I'm not just saying like when things are really

550
00:28:00.315 --> 00:28:01.635
good, you know you can do

551
00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:02.995
that when things are good in your life,

552
00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:05.155
of course you can act the same way with everybody.

553
00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:06.195
It's not, that's not a problem.

554
00:28:06.415 --> 00:28:10.735
But when things fall apart, crumble, it begins

555
00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:12.175
to really squeeze out what's

556
00:28:12.295 --> 00:28:13.335
actually in the sponge of your heart.

557
00:28:15.565 --> 00:28:20.005
Are you the same in every situation? That's integrity.

558
00:28:22.135 --> 00:28:24.995
And I man, this, this was hard, this part was hard

559
00:28:25.215 --> 00:28:26.395
for me this week to write,

560
00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:30.915
but let's just think about how we as Christians

561
00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:32.715
don't do this very well.

562
00:28:35.855 --> 00:28:40.085
Think about how often what we say

563
00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:42.445
we believe and how we should live

564
00:28:44.425 --> 00:28:47.395
doesn't in any way match the way we actually live.

565
00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:52.725
And I don't just say that to, to say, well,

566
00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:55.285
I think objectively kind of, you know, it's,

567
00:28:55.355 --> 00:28:56.445
it's a bit of here and there.

568
00:28:56.525 --> 00:28:57.925
I see it happen from time to time.

569
00:28:58.105 --> 00:29:02.775
No, statistically this bears out that we

570
00:29:02.775 --> 00:29:05.095
as Christians say, we believe and do certain things

571
00:29:05.195 --> 00:29:06.335
but we actually don't.

572
00:29:06.335 --> 00:29:07.335
Let give you a couple examples.

573
00:29:10.395 --> 00:29:12.295
We talk about sexual purity a lot.

574
00:29:14.245 --> 00:29:15.265
Yet pornography

575
00:29:16.365 --> 00:29:19.745
and just messing around runs rampant,

576
00:29:21.445 --> 00:29:24.815
not just in younger people, in every generation

577
00:29:28.175 --> 00:29:31.075
we declare the the sacredness.

578
00:29:31.075 --> 00:29:33.195
Now we as Christians, marriage is sacred

579
00:29:34.855 --> 00:29:39.395
and yet hundreds upon hundreds of spouses are abused

580
00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:43.795
and mistreated and are terrified to go home Within churches.

581
00:29:49.505 --> 00:29:53.685
We, we say we believe in caring for the poor, caring

582
00:29:53.705 --> 00:29:57.205
for the outcast in providing generously to people in need.

583
00:29:57.545 --> 00:30:00.285
Yet our money and our time flow to the lakehouse

584
00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:02.405
or to more toys for ourselves.

585
00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:11.525
We say we believe, we say we treasure and cherish,

586
00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:15.165
and yet our lives look so far from it.

587
00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:20.995
And we could go on and on. There's list after list.

588
00:30:21.055 --> 00:30:24.555
But listen, when our lives don't come close to matching

589
00:30:24.555 --> 00:30:29.295
what we say, the world looks at this

590
00:30:29.715 --> 00:30:32.215
and just sees it as religious performance.

591
00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:36.135
They don't see true faith.

592
00:30:38.205 --> 00:30:40.695
What they see is a social club with a little bit

593
00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:42.495
of morality sprinkled on top of it.

594
00:30:46.075 --> 00:30:48.295
And so something needs to change in our lives, right?

595
00:30:50.225 --> 00:30:51.475
Like is that all this is?

596
00:30:51.575 --> 00:30:52.875
Is this just a social club

597
00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:54.915
that we have some Jesus language on top?

598
00:30:55.055 --> 00:30:58.985
Is that all? Is that all this is something needs

599
00:30:58.985 --> 00:31:00.225
to change in our lives?

600
00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:02.225
How do we get to that level of integrity

601
00:31:02.355 --> 00:31:06.345
where we're the same person every situation, every situation

602
00:31:06.345 --> 00:31:09.025
of life, we're gonna look the same externally, internally,

603
00:31:09.705 --> 00:31:10.825
regardless of how our life's going.

604
00:31:11.005 --> 00:31:13.585
How can we get there? How did David get there?

605
00:31:16.755 --> 00:31:18.655
Go back quickly to chapter two verse one.

606
00:31:23.775 --> 00:31:26.545
Just quickly look at this Chapter two verse one.

607
00:31:27.375 --> 00:31:29.185
This was right after Saul died,

608
00:31:29.565 --> 00:31:31.385
the crisis moment of his life.

609
00:31:31.445 --> 00:31:33.865
He could decide to go whichever way he wanted.

610
00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:34.985
Watch this verse one

611
00:31:35.155 --> 00:31:38.065
after this, David inquired of the Lord,

612
00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:40.945
shall I go up into the any of the cities of Judah?

613
00:31:41.005 --> 00:31:42.225
The Lord said to him, go up.

614
00:31:42.225 --> 00:31:44.065
Okay, David said, all right, to which shall I go up?

615
00:31:44.165 --> 00:31:47.985
And he said to Hebrew, did you see what that phrase was?

616
00:31:48.235 --> 00:31:50.985
David inquired of the Lord.

617
00:31:54.585 --> 00:31:58.515
That phrase appears at least six times in first

618
00:31:58.515 --> 00:32:02.345
and second Samuel, Like as he is deciding where

619
00:32:02.345 --> 00:32:03.825
to go, deciding what to do.

620
00:32:03.885 --> 00:32:06.185
Should I do this? Should I, how could I talk this way?

621
00:32:06.185 --> 00:32:08.265
David inquired to the Lord, David inquire to the Lord.

622
00:32:08.405 --> 00:32:11.825
That's revealing something about his heart, right?

623
00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:17.565
It means David's highest priority was knowing God's will

624
00:32:17.705 --> 00:32:18.925
and obeying God's will.

625
00:32:18.925 --> 00:32:21.845
David, I God's, God's saying, David is saying,

626
00:32:21.845 --> 00:32:23.005
God, I want to follow you.

627
00:32:23.205 --> 00:32:25.525
I wanna know your will. I wanna be obedient to you.

628
00:32:25.865 --> 00:32:27.005
He, he had integrity

629
00:32:27.305 --> 00:32:30.365
and he was saying, God, I trust your will over my ambition.

630
00:32:30.605 --> 00:32:33.725
I want nothing else but your will.

631
00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:37.365
Any authority he received came from his

632
00:32:37.365 --> 00:32:38.685
submission to the ultimate authority.

633
00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:41.845
It wasn't him claiming it, it was him receiving it

634
00:32:41.945 --> 00:32:43.365
and he lived it out with integrity.

635
00:32:44.585 --> 00:32:45.725
Is that how you live your life?

636
00:32:48.795 --> 00:32:51.015
Is that how you live your life?

637
00:32:52.775 --> 00:32:56.145
Have you said to your heavenly father, not my will,

638
00:32:56.365 --> 00:33:00.645
but your will be done in every

639
00:33:01.405 --> 00:33:03.165
situation, every moment.

640
00:33:03.675 --> 00:33:06.925
Your highest priority is God, I wanna obey you.

641
00:33:07.195 --> 00:33:08.965
Your commands, your leadership,

642
00:33:09.015 --> 00:33:11.365
everything in my life is all yours.

643
00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:14.365
Or are you more focused on your personal ambition,

644
00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:17.205
your personal preferences, your way of doing things?

645
00:33:17.385 --> 00:33:21.285
Are you trying to force through your plan instead of waiting

646
00:33:21.385 --> 00:33:22.445
for God's timing?

647
00:33:24.575 --> 00:33:25.955
Are you going about your life?

648
00:33:26.055 --> 00:33:27.675
And man, this is really easy for me to do.

649
00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:29.875
Are you going through your life saying, okay,

650
00:33:30.225 --> 00:33:32.795
I've got all this intuition, I've got all this knowledge,

651
00:33:32.865 --> 00:33:33.955
I've got all this history.

652
00:33:34.315 --> 00:33:36.435
I know how to live my life. I know where I'm going.

653
00:33:36.795 --> 00:33:41.165
I don't need you. God, none of us would ever say

654
00:33:41.165 --> 00:33:42.525
that, but we live it.

655
00:33:48.575 --> 00:33:53.265
Instead of humbly coming to prayerfully, coming

656
00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:56.745
to God's Word and saying, God, what do you want?

657
00:33:58.185 --> 00:33:59.315
Like God, what's your will?

658
00:34:01.585 --> 00:34:03.635
Clearly commands are his will.

659
00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:05.115
But then he's like he,

660
00:34:05.115 --> 00:34:07.435
he's not maybe gonna write it on the sky where you should go

661
00:34:07.435 --> 00:34:09.075
to college or where you should do this

662
00:34:09.095 --> 00:34:10.115
or that, or who are you gonna marry?

663
00:34:10.555 --> 00:34:11.555
Whatever it is like he, but,

664
00:34:11.615 --> 00:34:14.515
but you should filter it through the lens.

665
00:34:14.815 --> 00:34:16.115
God, show me God.

666
00:34:16.145 --> 00:34:17.435
Tell me whichever way

667
00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.755
and trust he's gonna lead your pathway as you go.

668
00:34:19.815 --> 00:34:21.035
Is that the way you live your life?

669
00:34:21.045 --> 00:34:24.195
Every moment you wake up of the day and

670
00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.755
and every moment of the day you say, God, not my will,

671
00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:29.035
but your will be done on Friday night.

672
00:34:29.035 --> 00:34:30.675
When that temptation comes, God,

673
00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.275
not my will, your will be done.

674
00:34:32.465 --> 00:34:35.835
When you face that crisis moment in your family, God,

675
00:34:35.895 --> 00:34:38.075
not my will, your will be done at work

676
00:34:38.135 --> 00:34:40.475
and you're tempted to do a little bit of cutting corners,

677
00:34:40.615 --> 00:34:42.395
God, not my will, but your will be done.

678
00:34:43.985 --> 00:34:45.165
Is that how you live your life?

679
00:34:49.895 --> 00:34:51.835
That's the environment integrity grows in.

680
00:34:52.935 --> 00:34:56.075
That's when you submit to the the will of the Father

681
00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:58.955
and you say, God, I'm getting out of the way.

682
00:34:59.185 --> 00:35:01.635
It's yours. I'm following you.

683
00:35:02.615 --> 00:35:03.915
He makes you more Christ-like

684
00:35:04.195 --> 00:35:06.475
'cause you obey Him, you follow him.

685
00:35:09.215 --> 00:35:11.715
And that's how he grows the character in you

686
00:35:11.715 --> 00:35:13.995
that looks more like Jesus in the small things

687
00:35:14.815 --> 00:35:17.155
as he prepares you for something that may be bigger later

688
00:35:22.975 --> 00:35:24.875
and so far in first and second Samuel.

689
00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:26.355
But we've seen David do that pretty well.

690
00:35:30.655 --> 00:35:32.355
But sadly that won't last very long.

691
00:35:34.805 --> 00:35:38.885
You may remember the story in Genesis of the Garden of Eden

692
00:35:38.885 --> 00:35:42.845
and Adam and Eve, like it was really good for two chapters.

693
00:35:45.725 --> 00:35:47.585
And then chapter three, it all tanks

694
00:35:47.585 --> 00:35:48.665
and everything goes south.

695
00:35:48.805 --> 00:35:51.635
And, and we'll see David

696
00:35:53.525 --> 00:35:56.215
fall into some of the same traps that Saul

697
00:35:56.275 --> 00:35:58.495
and others did as the king,

698
00:36:02.005 --> 00:36:05.235
which again leads us to the overall point of these books.

699
00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:08.405
Yes, David's a great example.

700
00:36:08.475 --> 00:36:09.765
He's a man after God's own heart.

701
00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:10.965
He's Israel's greatest king.

702
00:36:10.965 --> 00:36:14.405
But hear me, David is not the hero of this story.

703
00:36:19.225 --> 00:36:23.755
He's merely a pointer to the true hero.

704
00:36:24.135 --> 00:36:27.675
The one who fulfilled all that David could merely

705
00:36:28.315 --> 00:36:29.915
resemble Jesus Christ.

706
00:36:31.405 --> 00:36:32.795
Jesus fulfilled

707
00:36:33.905 --> 00:36:37.515
what David could only bear some resemblance to

708
00:36:39.215 --> 00:36:40.275
Now we're gonna see David.

709
00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:43.075
Yes, he appeared to be a savior in many ways.

710
00:36:43.175 --> 00:36:45.235
He re, he brought the nation together.

711
00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:46.795
He was a savior of his people.

712
00:36:46.855 --> 00:36:50.275
He was kind of Messiah like kind of Christ-like in a way.

713
00:36:50.495 --> 00:36:53.835
He was a type. He taught us a lot about the Messiah to come,

714
00:36:54.095 --> 00:36:55.675
but he is not the savior.

715
00:36:55.675 --> 00:36:59.595
There's a true greater king to come after David,

716
00:37:00.865 --> 00:37:03.245
and he's the one that we stand today

717
00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:07.525
and we worship the perfect king who did everything in full

718
00:37:07.675 --> 00:37:10.405
that David could only do in part who fulfilled it all.

719
00:37:10.405 --> 00:37:12.085
Everything David did imperfectly.

720
00:37:12.335 --> 00:37:15.365
Jesus did perfectly just listen to how he did this,

721
00:37:15.505 --> 00:37:16.885
how Jesus is the greater David.

722
00:37:17.265 --> 00:37:21.085
He loved his enemies, not just by grieving for them,

723
00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:23.085
but by dying for them.

724
00:37:25.685 --> 00:37:28.555
Jesus sought the Father's will perfectly, even in the garden

725
00:37:28.555 --> 00:37:31.715
of Gethsemane when he's facing the, the horror of the cross,

726
00:37:31.895 --> 00:37:33.755
the very next day he said,

727
00:37:34.015 --> 00:37:35.435
not my will, but your will be done.

728
00:37:37.905 --> 00:37:40.685
He always led with complete transparency and integrity.

729
00:37:40.715 --> 00:37:43.765
Hebrews four 15, we do not have a high priest who's unable

730
00:37:43.765 --> 00:37:45.085
to sympathize with our weaknesses,

731
00:37:45.425 --> 00:37:48.485
but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are

732
00:37:48.905 --> 00:37:50.205
yet without sin.

733
00:37:52.225 --> 00:37:53.925
That's our king. Perfect.

734
00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:57.815
And because of that perfection,

735
00:37:57.815 --> 00:38:00.775
because of that obedience through his death

736
00:38:00.775 --> 00:38:05.255
and resurrection, he has ended the ultimate division

737
00:38:05.485 --> 00:38:06.495
between God

738
00:38:06.635 --> 00:38:10.135
and humanity, by bringing sinners back home

739
00:38:10.395 --> 00:38:12.295
to God the Father, the civil war

740
00:38:12.295 --> 00:38:14.655
that David faced has no candle to hold

741
00:38:14.795 --> 00:38:17.895
to the desperate dependence we have on God

742
00:38:17.955 --> 00:38:21.375
to take sinners home with him only through his work.

743
00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:26.975
That is our king. That's who this is pointing us to.

744
00:38:29.365 --> 00:38:32.665
And all praise should go to that true king Jesus Christ.

745
00:38:32.755 --> 00:38:36.165
Let's pray. God, thank you so much for your grace

746
00:38:36.385 --> 00:38:40.965
and mercy, your word pointing us to those truths.

747
00:38:41.025 --> 00:38:44.805
And I pray, God, that, that we would recognize

748
00:38:44.825 --> 00:38:47.845
and see you as the true king.

749
00:38:47.845 --> 00:38:49.205
Learn from what we can with David,

750
00:38:49.705 --> 00:38:53.005
but point to you, look to you, worship you.

751
00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:59.685
But I know there's some of us walked in this room today,

752
00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:04.165
and we've spent most of our lives looking for a king

753
00:39:06.785 --> 00:39:10.165
in this world, somebody to satisfy, somebody

754
00:39:10.165 --> 00:39:11.525
to fulfill somebody, to protect

755
00:39:12.275 --> 00:39:14.205
something, to do all of that.

756
00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:19.045
And they are disappointed and exhausted in that search.

757
00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:25.605
Some have walked in here looking for themself

758
00:39:26.265 --> 00:39:28.685
to be the king, to be able to live it out perfectly,

759
00:39:28.685 --> 00:39:31.405
to be this one that that I just described.

760
00:39:33.305 --> 00:39:35.485
And they're recognizing that they can't do that.

761
00:39:37.195 --> 00:39:39.005
They never could. And so God,

762
00:39:39.005 --> 00:39:41.085
what you're just showing us always is that we need

763
00:39:41.085 --> 00:39:45.165
to savior king and praise

764
00:39:45.865 --> 00:39:47.245
the Father that you provided.

765
00:39:49.745 --> 00:39:52.525
God the Son, took on flesh to do all of this

766
00:39:54.865 --> 00:39:59.205
so that we could be saved, which means you're worthy.

767
00:40:00.745 --> 00:40:02.485
So God, draw us to yourself in that.

768
00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:03.845
Help us see you rightly

769
00:40:04.265 --> 00:40:07.565
and respond to you rightly, in Jesus' name.

770
00:40:08.115 --> 00:40:12.405
Amen. Part of that response today involves the Lord's.
