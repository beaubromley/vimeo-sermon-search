00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.300
if

2
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.400
Well, good morning again Church. It is a joy to worship together

3
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.700
every time especially to begin this summer. Let me encourage you to stay connected.

4
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.600
It's really easy in the summer to get disconnected and as

5
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
we're in and out for vacations and such as you've

6
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.500
seen already. This is a really encouraging opportunity

7
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
to look deeply into God's word

8
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
what he has to say to us what we're going to

9
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.600
study over these summer Sundays is 10

10
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.200
of Jesus's parables.

11
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.100
That we might call stories with a purpose.

12
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.800
Out of the Book of Luke as we've been in Luke a lot this year.

13
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
So we're going to study these stories that have not just

14
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.700
a point but a purpose and something Eternal.

15
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.100
So take your copy of God's word and turn to the

16
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.200
Book of Luke chapter 8.

17
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.300
We'll find the first Parable there.

18
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.300
Luke chapter 8

19
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.700
Now there's a reason God led us to this one to study first and

20
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.500
it's not just because it's a really good Parable

21
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.000
as you'll see.

22
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.200
And it's not even just because Jesus told us

23
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.900
the meaning of the parable, which is really helpful.

24
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.700
It's also because in it Jesus also included

25
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.600
the reason why he even spoke in

26
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.400
parables.

27
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.500
So that's where we're going to start is we're going to look at a broad overview of The Parables

28
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.300
before we even get into this one, but we're looking at jesus' Big

29
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.700
why?

30
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.600
The context is found in verse 1.

31
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.700
Where Jesus was traveling all over the region. He was fulfilling back from

32
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.200
Luke 4 what he read as a prophecy of

33
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.700
his life. He was he was doing Miracles. He was healing people. He

34
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.900
was preaching the Good News of God's Kingdom.

35
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.700
That's why we subtitled the sermon series on Parables secrets

36
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.600
of the Kingdom.

37
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.600
Because that's what Jesus was doing.

38
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.600
He was using these real to life stories to

39
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.300
illustrate what the nature of

40
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.200
his kingdom was and is and and how to live

41
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.900
in light of it.

42
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.600
So these not just good stories to memorize. These are actually teaching

43
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.400
us about his kingdom.

44
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.200
And so we hear that and we might initially be really grateful that

45
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200
that Jesus would take it off the top shelf and put on a low shelf

46
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.700
with some stories, right? Because we love pictures. We love videos. We're

47
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.400
all about that. Thank you Jesus for making it simple for

48
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.700
us.

49
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.700
You might think that.

50
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.900
Until we read what Jesus himself said about why

51
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.800
he used parables.

52
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.100
We see here in Luke 8 look at the back half of verse 8 down

53
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.900
through verse 10.

54
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.300
He had just told the parable we'll get to in a second. He said these things he

55
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.100
called out he who has ears to hear Let Him hear.

56
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.600
And when his disciples asked him what the parable meant he said

57
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.500
to you. It has been given to know the secrets

58
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.800
of the kingdom of God.

59
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.500
But for others they are in parables.

60
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.300
So that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not

61
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.700
understand.

62
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.500
Now that's actually a shortened quote from Isaiah chapter 6 where when

63
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.700
God called Isaiah into his ministry. He basically

64
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.200
told Isaiah which is really encouraging. He said

65
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.700
Isaiah. Nobody's going to listen to you.

66
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.300
As you go preach. Nobody's going to listen.

67
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.700
And that wasn't a punishment. It was to bring

68
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.200
about the salvation of the Gentiles eventually. We

69
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.100
see that through the story of Israel.

70
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.300
But Jesus Takes that concept of what God Said to

71
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.900
Isaiah and he applies it to his Parables Mark

72
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.100
4 actually adds a little bit to it.

73
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.800
He says the same quote. He says they may indeed see but

74
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.900
not perceive and indeed here but not understand lest they

75
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.800
should turn and be forgiven.

76
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.000
so you see

77
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.300
Jesus is saying Parables separate.

78
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.000
Parables show who's really in believing

79
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.900
and who's not believing?

80
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.400
That's what Jesus said in John 8 as well. He said many didn't understand

81
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.100
what he said because they were of their father the devil.

82
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.600
They were not of God.

83
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.100
First Corinthians 2 adds that you have to have the spirit of

84
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.400
God inside of you to understand the things of God. So so all

85
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400
of this is coming back to the point.

86
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.400
That the parables are meant to divide.

87
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.900
So when you think about in that context?

88
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.900
Puts a little more weight on these Parables, doesn't it?

89
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.700
That it is really critical then for our eyes

90
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.600
to see for our ears to hear what

91
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.400
Jesus is saying.

92
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.900
Now listen when I say it's important for us to be able to hear what

93
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.600
I don't mean is what sometimes happens with me

94
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.700
with my wife.

95
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.700
You know guys, you'll probably understand what I'm saying here in

96
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.800
this is that whenever she will say something

97
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.100
to me. I will even acknowledge that

98
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.000
she said it to me and then I

99
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.200
have no idea what she said, right?

100
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.400
Don't nudge him. I saw you do that right like this. You understand

101
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.700
what I'm saying? Right? And so what happens is like the

102
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.200
the words the wavelengths of the sound goes in my

103
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.400
ear. It vertebrates my ear drum and

104
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.300
and I in my my brain says a

105
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.500
human is talking to me.

106
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.300
But then I have completely not listened at

107
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.500
all.

108
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.000
This is similar.

109
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.600
To what happens here in Luke 8 that

110
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.200
that as I was distracted and

111
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.500
I was focused on something else. I was seeing something else that's

112
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.900
more important than what she was saying.

113
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.000
When Jesus shares to the crowd around

114
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.300
him, what does he tell them he tells them

115
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.500
a parable.

116
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.800
This great crowd is gathering. And so

117
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.500
what happens in that moment as many people would hear

118
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.600
what he said, but not many people actually heard

119
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.000
Jesus.

120
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.900
Based on the response that we'll see here in a second.

121
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.700
That's what this Parable perfectly explains.

122
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.700
It shares. Why does not

123
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.300
everyone see Jesus as the king?

124
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.300
Right because we sit back here 2000 years later.

125
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.200
And we think about Jesus healing people and teaching what

126
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.300
he taught and and walking around doing the Miracles and we're

127
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.600
sitting here. Like, how did you guys miss that?

128
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.900
How does the only end up with like 12?

129
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.300
How does he only end up with a few at the end? How did so many

130
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.200
people miss it?

131
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.600
Well, this Parable will show us clear reasons why

132
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.000
people didn't respond to him.

133
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.600
Why they did not worship Jesus and

134
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.600
again as we study this Parable today, let's all

135
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.500
Not Just Hear It for those people. Let's

136
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.200
let's examine our own Hearts. Let's

137
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.200
let's make sure that we each are willing to

138
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.900
hear as well.

139
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.700
That we're willing to see Jesus willing to see his kingdom willing

140
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.500
to see what it looks like to actually follow this

141
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.300
Savior King.

142
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.000
This is for us just as much.

143
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.900
So here's the parable of the sower Luke 8 verses 5

144
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.200
through 8. This is the actual Parable Jesus told the

145
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.700
crowd.

146
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.700
He says A sower went out to sow his seed as

147
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.200
he sowed some fell along the path and

148
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.100
was trampled underfoot and the birds of the air devoured it.

149
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.300
Some fell on the rock.

150
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.300
And as it grew up it withered away because it had no moisture.

151
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.100
And some fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up

152
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.400
with it and choked it.

153
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.400
And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a

154
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.300
hundredfold.

155
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.500
As he said these things he called out he who has ears to

156
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.200
hear Let Him hear.

157
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.200
So just put yourself for a moment. Remember this

158
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.200
crowds around I put yourself in the sandals of those who would

159
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.800
have heard this for the first time.

160
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.600
They're hearing Jesus say this story of the

161
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.000
sower. And and so there they're standing there as a

162
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.000
member of the crowd. They're intrigued by this Jesus figure. They may

163
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.300
have heard some things about him and they hear this and this

164
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:25.800
is all they get

165
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.500
It's one sentence couple sentences.

166
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.700
So you're sitting there thinking?

167
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.600
Does Jesus want us to learn about like how to harvest better as

168
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.900
he's teaching us principles of wheat? I don't

169
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.300
know and and so you think how they would

170
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.300
have responded if they were not already looking for the

171
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.300
kingdom to come.

172
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.900
They might have missed it.

173
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.800
They would have missed it pretty simply, right which again?

174
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.400
part of the point

175
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.400
of why Jesus was even using parables.

176
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.300
Well thankfully jesus' disciples were still

177
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.300
in the early learning stages as well. And so Jesus

178
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.800
continues in this first Parable here and he

179
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.000
explains the parable for us teaching us how to

180
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.400
interpret it thankfully.

181
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.100
This is down in verse 11. The disciples asked him. What does this

182
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.500
mean Jesus?

183
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.300
Told them that he talks in Parables for this reason now

184
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.700
verse 11. He explains the parable.

185
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.100
He says the parable is this the seed is the word

186
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.500
of God.

187
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.800
The ones along the path are those who have heard then

188
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.300
the Devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts,

189
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.700
so they may not believe and be saved.

190
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.400
And the ones on the Rock are those who when they

191
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.200
hear the word receive it with joy.

192
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.700
But these have no root they believe for a while and a

193
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.600
time of testing Fall Away.

194
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.800
And as for what fell among the Thorns they are those who hear but

195
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.200
as they go on their way. They are choked by the

196
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.800
cares and riches and pleasures of life and their

197
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.600
fruit does not mature.

198
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.500
As for that in the good soil they are those who hearing the

199
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.400
word hold it fast in an honest and

200
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.100
good heart and bear fruit with patience.

201
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.400
So first as Jesus explaining this whole Parable he starts

202
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.400
with what even is the seed?

203
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.300
We need to understand the principle and the points here. The first

204
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.600
is the seed that sower's out there sowing Jesus

205
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.200
says, that's the word of God.

206
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.300
Now when we hear the word of God, we think Bible.

207
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.700
Which is not wrong because these are God's

208
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.400
words to us. Yes, but in

209
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.200
the context more specifically Jesus most likely referring to

210
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.900
the gospel of the Kingdom.

211
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.500
Remember in Luke 4 he had pointed forward

212
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.900
to what he was coming to do part of that was to proclaim the

213
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.300
good news of the Kingdom. It's

214
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.000
the same message that the prophets of old had proclaimed

215
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.000
for out centuries that

216
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.700
the Messiah King was coming.

217
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.200
And now Jesus says the Messiah King is here.

218
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.900
It's me.

219
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.300
And God's kingdom is now coming on Earth as it

220
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.200
is in heaven.

221
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.200
Now we know that's going to look like things in the world are going

222
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.300
to change but primarily God's kingdom coming

223
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.500
on Earth is how God reigning more

224
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.100
and more in human hearts.

225
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.200
The more human hearts that he reigns in

226
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.000
that he's in charge of these the king over then the more

227
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.600
the world around us will look like the kingdom principles.

228
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.500
That a kingdom citizen will be living out, right?

229
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.300
so at first happens inside

230
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.500
Doesn't just like manufacture some kind

231
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.800
of laws or country and impose it

232
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.200
on the world. Now, it comes from inside out of

233
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.700
his citizens.

234
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.000
Well now we know today on the back side of Jesus's Ministry

235
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.400
that that change in ownership of our hearts

236
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.500
comes through repenting and believing the Gospel of

237
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.600
Jesus Christ that he lived died and resurrected in

238
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.700
my place for my sin to purchase my

239
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.600
salvation to purchase your salvation that that

240
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.000
is what he accomplished. So when I believe in

241
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.800
him

242
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.600
I'm a new creation. I'm a new citizen.

243
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.100
I'm a kingdom.

244
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.400
And the kingdom resident now.

245
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.600
And God brings his kingdom to Bear through me

246
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.400
through you through his people.

247
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.900
But what is evident from this parable?

248
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.400
Is that not everybody responds to

249
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.100
that word of the Gospel in faith and obedience?

250
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.500
Number Jesus used Parables to separate he's clear

251
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.200
in this Parable one of the four.

252
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.800
is actually his

253
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.500
And so what he does in this is he shares why not everyone

254
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.600
sees Jesus as king.

255
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.800
Why did three of the four soils miss it?

256
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.700
Well, the first group he says is because their hearts are dead.

257
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.600
The first group completely misses it because their hearts

258
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.100
are dead so their eyes and their ears are closed to

259
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.700
the kingdom of God.

260
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.800
This is the hard soil the pathway in

261
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.500
the parable, right? That's that's the walking path around

262
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.000
these these fields were not very big.

263
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.300
and so there was walking past around and sometimes even through

264
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.500
where the sower would walk and Scatter the seed

265
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.500
on his plot of ground and and the the Harvester later

266
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.100
would come and walk on those Pathways to harvest in the fruit

267
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.800
of his labor and then Travelers at

268
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.600
times would walk through fields and they would walk on these Pathways which

269
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:55.800
would

270
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.200
compress press down Harden the

271
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.200
soil on the walkway the pathway, right?

272
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.100
This is the hard soil.

273
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.800
but notice notice

274
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.000
These heard the word too. Right?

275
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.000
Did you see how many times throughout that passage?

276
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.600
They heard they heard they heard every

277
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.700
one of the soils heard including the hard soil.

278
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.300
The sower was scattering the seed and some of

279
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.800
the seed fell along the path as well.

280
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.300
It just would stay on the top.

281
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.000
exposed

282
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.200
never able

283
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.100
to take root

284
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.400
So what happened those birds flew in?

285
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200
Snatched it away.

286
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.100
Well, Jesus says that's what happens.

287
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.500
to people who have hard soil

288
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:55.800
the devil

289
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.100
comes in and takes away the word from

290
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.200
these people's hearts so that they may not believe and

291
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.700
be saved.

292
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.100
So how does somebody get to that hard soil?

293
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.100
How does somebody get there finally?

294
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.400
Well, this is primarily someone who is so hardened by

295
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.000
sin that they are blinded to the gospel.

296
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.100
They're unmoved by the things of God.

297
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.400
Their consciences are seared to the point where they don't hear

298
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.400
it goes in one ear and it goes out the other ear. They're not

299
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.800
at all affected by God's truth in any way.

300
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.400
It's like you're sitting on a plane before takeoff.

301
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.900
And that flight attendant is up there and and they're sharing life

302
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.600
and death emergency procedures.

303
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.600
I want to watch a movie on my phone.

304
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.200
Like that's what we do, right? We we just

305
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.700
completely disregard what that person's saying.

306
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.600
Now we won't never need that.

307
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.600
We're fine.

308
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.200
Until you actually need it. Right and you're like, where's the exit?

309
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.200
You know, you you don't know but we have chosen to just

310
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.600
write it off. We're hard to it because we've

311
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.300
heard it so many times.

312
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.900
We think we know it already.

313
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.800
And we choose to watch or read something else and completely

314
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.500
disregard.

315
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.100
So think about that initial crowd.

316
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.900
Who would have been the hard soil?

317
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.700
Well, the Pharisees were hard soil because later

318
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.200
people listening to this wanted to

319
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.000
kill Jesus just a few months later.

320
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.500
And so we know that's hard soil obviously.

321
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.000
but also

322
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.100
hard soil people would have been those

323
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.500
Who listened in to what Jesus had to say?

324
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.100
kind of shrug their shoulders

325
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.200
moved on down the road.

326
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:04.800
whatever

327
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.500
fine good. Okay, interesting and move

328
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:08.600
on.

329
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.300
That's hard soil, too.

330
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.800
And listen, you don't have to be an atheist.

331
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.500
To have hard soil like that in your heart.

332
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.000
in fact Hebrews 3 warns us

333
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.600
says take care Brothers lest there

334
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.100
be in any of you an evil unbelieving heart leading

335
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.700
you to fall away from the Living God.

336
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.300
But exhort one another every day as long as

337
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.000
it is called today that none of you may be hardened.

338
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.900
by the deceitfulness of sin

339
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.000
remember he's writing that to people who are supposed to

340
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.000
be believers.

341
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.600
He's saying to people who are in the church.

342
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.400
Take care that you don't fall away. Take care that

343
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.500
you don't have a hardened heart because of

344
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.700
the deceitfulness of sin.

345
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.300
And this hardening can occur over time. It doesn't

346
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.600
happen immediately. It's an overtime Harding like

347
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.300
a fossil right a fossil hardens over a long

348
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.800
period of time where you just forget God and

349
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.900
you function like an atheist.

350
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.900
A pastor in our area wrote a book about that Christian atheist.

351
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.000
You have all the right language. You have all the right words and you talk about

352
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.500
like you're You're Everything Is Right on the outside

353
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.200
but you function like you don't

354
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.700
even believe God exists.

355
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.800
You live your life on your own you don't depend on him and

356
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.400
that is hard-heartedness.

357
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.500
So Hear Me If You Are unmoved by the things of

358
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:52.700
God

359
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.500
If you have no desire to pursue God in any

360
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.500
way if you're if you have no desire to be with his people with

361
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.000
brothers and sisters to exhort you and encourage you then see

362
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.800
the dangerous position you're in.

363
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.000
See that your heart might be hard. It

364
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.100
might be dead.

365
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.500
Be concerned about that.

366
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.600
It's the first reason people don't respond to Jesus as

367
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.700
king is because their hearts are dead.

368
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.300
He gives us a second reason here.

369
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.700
It's because people's hearts are afraid.

370
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.500
He says people.

371
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:36.600
have

372
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.300
fearful

373
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.400
Hearts they're afraid.

374
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.600
This is that rocky soil in verse 13.

375
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.600
Now this is interesting this soil the rocky soil initially. It

376
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.300
seemed to be good, right?

377
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.100
They received the word that they had heard.

378
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.200
And there was even a lot of joy that comes with it right away.

379
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.700
But it turned out to have no root.

380
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.700
It did not last when they were tested.

381
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.400
It withered under the Heat.

382
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.300
Over time they proved they did not really give their lives to

383
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.600
it in the first place that it did not take Deep Roots into

384
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.400
their soul.

385
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.400
Even though it looked good for a while.

386
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.400
We're coming up on July 4th. So this will happen a lot. But these these were

387
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.100
the ones Around Jesus who were like Roman candles. You know what I

388
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.500
mean by a Roman Candle just shooting little flares out one at

389
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.500
a time. Probably 10 of them.

390
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.300
These were the people who were around Jesus at the

391
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.100
time who were glowing with amazement at his

392
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.200
teaching at his miracles and they're just cloud like

393
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.000
Jesus is a great man. You're awesome is the best thing we've ever

394
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.700
seen. We love you Jesus.

395
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.200
But quickly fizzled out when trouble came.

396
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.100
And the Romans pressed in the Pharisees started asking questions.

397
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.400
I don't know. I don't know who this guy is.

398
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.500
Listen, I fear that that's coming from American Christianity at

399
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.600
some point.

400
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.500
that when the real persecution comes

401
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.900
when the real pressure hits our numbers

402
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.900
shrink dramatically.

403
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.500
When those who are in it only for the benefits.

404
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:36.700
slip away

405
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.500
It would not be the first time this has happened.

406
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.300
Happened even 2,000 years ago first John

407
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.200
2:19, they went out from us, but they

408
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.100
were not of us for if they had been of us. They

409
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.300
would have continued with us.

410
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.100
But they went out that it might be complain that

411
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.700
they all are not of us.

412
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.900
And they weren't really Believers to begin with.

413
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.100
Listen, it is so simple and easy to rejoice in

414
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.800
times of prosperity to rejoice

415
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.200
when things are easy to rejoice when things are

416
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.400
great on Sunday mornings. It's easy to lift your hands and and say

417
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.100
we put a fish sticker on my car. My profile is gonna

418
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.700
look some way on Facebook. Like I'm gonna do it. It's really easy when it's

419
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.000
times of prosperity.

420
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.500
But the deepest walk with God comes through

421
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.900
times of suffering.

422
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.600
Comes in the midst of the pain whenever you must

423
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.400
stand through the suffering you must look

424
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.700
beyond the suffering.

425
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.800
The rocky soil is afraid.

426
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.200
afraid of what people might think

427
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.500
afraid of suffering and pain

428
00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.500
afraid of death

429
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.900
The rocky soil has not trusted that

430
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.700
rooting yourself in Jesus is worth

431
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.700
whatever comes.

432
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.100
So we have dead hearts.

433
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.400
fearful hearts

434
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.800
the third heart soil condition

435
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.700
why people don't see Jesus king is because their hearts are worldly.

436
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.600
Some don't see Jesus as king because of worldliness.

437
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.200
This is that thorny soil.

438
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.400
That choked out what was seeming to

439
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:46.700
grow?

440
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.500
Again, these people heard the word and they appeared to

441
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.000
be true, but they did not produce fruit. It

442
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.800
didn't mature meaning it never actually came about

443
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.600
because the cares of the world

444
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.700
the deceitfulness of riches

445
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.400
The desires for the pleasures of life choked out

446
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.200
the life-giving nourishment that that plant

447
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:16.800
needed to grow.

448
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.500
Kept the Sun from shining. It sucked all the water out of the soil.

449
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.300
It kept it choked out.

450
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.600
Easily this can happen to us too, right?

451
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.300
Again, let's see ourselves here where we take our eyes off

452
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.100
of Jesus and we fix them on the things of this

453
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.300
world Where We crave more and new and better.

454
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.200
That's what Jesus said in Luke 12. We must take care be

455
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.200
on your guard against all covetousness against

456
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.100
greed.

457
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.200
For one's life does not consist in the abundance of his

458
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.100
possessions.

459
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.300
It's greediness choking out what God

460
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.100
wants to do. It's also things like where we're focused on

461
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.400
all the things the world's focused on like celebrities and and

462
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.800
sports and social media.

463
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.600
pleasure

464
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.200
entertainment

465
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.300
politics

466
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.800
your body your car your lawn. I mean whatever so many

467
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.800
other things can can creep in and choke

468
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.400
out now all those things. Are they evil?

469
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.500
No, not necessarily. Those things can actually be good for our

470
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.600
lives. They can be good to spend time on

471
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.200
but as soon as you take a good thing and you

472
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.900
make it a God thing, then it becomes a bad thing.

473
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.900
Because here's what happens when you start to find that you're getting discontent.

474
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.200
And whatever anything you get discontent and

475
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.700
you start to seek satisfaction in any of those other

476
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.300
things and you're looking for this to fill you in this

477
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.400
to fill you and this to fill you. That's when it actually destroys you.

478
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.400
Because what it does is it chokes out

479
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.900
the work of God's word in your life.

480
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:09.600
I think of

481
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.000
someone like King Herod.

482
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.700
Who is says gladly heard John the Baptist's

483
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:17.900
worth?

484
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.900
John the Baptist was the prophet that preceded Jesus and so

485
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.700
John the Baptist was a famous preacher. He was preaching hard

486
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.400
repentance and King Herod. Like I love this guy.

487
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.600
I want to hear him more bring him in.

488
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.500
until herod's lust

489
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.300
overtook him

490
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.700
And at that young girl's request.

491
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.900
He had John beheaded.

492
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.200
He was choked out what God was doing.

493
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.500
choked out by lust

494
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.300
Or even when you think of the Rich Young Ruler and Mark chapter

495
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.500
10.

496
00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.300
Who refused to follow Jesus because he would have had

497
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.800
to give up his entire Fortune.

498
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.700
or even Judas

499
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.300
Who sold out his friend for a couple pieces of silver?

500
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.300
It's thorny soil choking out his first

501
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.000
John 2 says don't love the world or anything in the world. If

502
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.300
anyone loves the world the love of the father is not

503
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.900
in him for all that is in the world the desires

504
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.300
of the flesh the desires of the eyes the

505
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.300
pride of life. It's not from the father. It's from

506
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:30.800
the world.

507
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.800
So do you see how dangerous materialism is?

508
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.000
It's one of those respectable sins that Jerry Bridges talks about that we can

509
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.800
just like it's okay as long as we're not earning our money unethically we're

510
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.100
okay.

511
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.200
It's dangerous.

512
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.100
This is how thorny the cares of the

513
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.500
world can be the deceitfulness of riches the

514
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.400
desires for other things. None of it comes from God

515
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.400
and what it does. It chokes out God's work

516
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:00.900
in your life.

517
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.400
Comes from your flesh it comes from the and it comes from the world around us and it's

518
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.400
all infecting our hearts.

519
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.300
And can destroy us through making us that bad soil.

520
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.600
So what do we do in response?

521
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.100
We look at this. We've heard the parable about the sower scattering

522
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.100
seed on the plot of ground. And now we've seen

523
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.400
why Jesus people reject Jesus as

524
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.200
their King. Why do they do it? Well now we've seen it. So what do

525
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.900
we do now?

526
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.200
We know he's talking to us, too. So, how should we respond to

527
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.800
this story with a purpose?

528
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.300
I'd imagine as I studied through I was

529
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.100
confronted by this as a we've walked through this you've already been subtly confronted with

530
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:50.700
this as well.

531
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.700
Right about right off the bat. We see that each of us should examine

532
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.100
our heart for the condition the quality of

533
00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.800
our soil.

534
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.200
Right, that's just the natural reading of this as you

535
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.200
read through it. You're just like which soil am I?

536
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.900
How's my heart? Am I this am I that

537
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.300
Again, this is pointing us to the nature of God's kingdom. It's showing us

538
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.400
that every single one of us in this room.

539
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.500
Every single person watching online is

540
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.700
either hard soil rocky soil thorny soil

541
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.600
or good soil.

542
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:27.700
every one of us

543
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.300
and listen, I don't know that for you.

544
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.200
I can't tell that only you and God actually know the

545
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.900
answer that question.

546
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.100
Only I and God know that answer for me.

547
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.600
Because again notice some of the soil look good initially.

548
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.500
It had the appearance of godliness, but it denied it's true power.

549
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.300
What that means is that you might be able to deceive other

550
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.200
people for a while.

551
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.400
Might be able to put on the facade of Christ like Behavior.

552
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.100
You cannot trick him.

553
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.500
And it won't last.

554
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.400
You might try to produce the fruit for a while, but it will not

555
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.400
last so that's the question today.

556
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.100
at the deepest core of Who You Are

557
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.100
What is the quality of your soil?

558
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.500
In your heart. What is the condition of your

559
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.500
soil?

560
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.100
Is it hard?

561
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.100
and unfeeling

562
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.100
dead to the things of the Lord.

563
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:42.600
Just don't care.

564
00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.500
Is it Rocky and shallow?

565
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.300
Where you're more afraid of what people think about you than what

566
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.000
God thinks about you.

567
00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.500
Is it being choked out?

568
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.200
by the Thorns of the world

569
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.300
where you're a lover of self and money and pleasure rather

570
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.100
than a lover of God.

571
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.500
It's the question he's asking us and and listen be

572
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.800
careful. Be careful not to deceive yourself.

573
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.300
That this is just a season.

574
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.900
It's just a season.

575
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.200
Where you're you're blind to the realities of your life.

576
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.500
Where you you have a view of yourself? That's too

577
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:32.900
high.

578
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.300
Be careful not to deceive yourself that you think this is

579
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.100
who I am but really everything in your life points to something else.

580
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.400
Plus just think about even if it isn't even if it is

581
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.100
only a season.

582
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.600
Why would you want to stay there?

583
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.200
Why would you want to stay in the thorny Iraq you're dead. So why would

584
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.300
you want to remain there?

585
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.900
When the good soil is an opportunity.

586
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.200
And so if you run a soil test right now and you find that you're

587
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.800
not good soil. What do you do?

588
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.200
Okay. I'm not I see these this is me.

589
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.900
What do I do?

590
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.300
You repent?

591
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.200
And turn away from whatever is poisoning your

592
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.800
soil right now and you run to Jesus.

593
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.900
You turn back to Jesus.

594
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.100
Hosea 10 says this break up your untiled ground.

595
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.600
It's time to seek the Lord.

596
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.300
He's talking to Israel talking to their their how overwhelmed

597
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.500
they are how they're completely walked

598
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.800
away from God. It's hard ground Hosea. The

599
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.200
prophet says break it up.

600
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.400
It's time now to seek the Lord. Why are you waiting?

601
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.500
It's not worth it. Stop living that way break it

602
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.600
up and let's seek the Lord. That's what he's saying

603
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.300
to you right now. Because remember the point of the parable in

604
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.500
the end like the sower wants to harvest the point

605
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.500
God's desire for his people is for

606
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.400
us to be good soil.

607
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.300
That's what he wants for his people. He wants each one of

608
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.800
us to glorify your God with the fruit of

609
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.100
your life as good soil.

610
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.400
That's what he wants not only to examine and kind

611
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.100
of sit in there and be like man. I'm really bad soil right now

612
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.400
and just kind of soak in that you get depressed by that. No, he's also

613
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.100
saying flip it glorify your God with the

614
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.700
fruit of your life.

615
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.900
You can be good soil.

616
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.100
And that's going to glorify your God. So if

617
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.400
you have ears to hear it today.

618
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.900
It's what Luke 8:15 says the good soil. What

619
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.100
is it characterized by it's those who

620
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.900
hold the word fast.

621
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.200
In an honest and good heart and

622
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.600
they bear fruit with patience.

623
00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.600
That seed of the word the gospel plants deeply

624
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.100
into their souls.

625
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.200
They have a healthy honest Kingdom motivation and

626
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.100
they bear fruit along the

627
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.600
way that's good soil.

628
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:13.800
because remember

629
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.300
all four of the soils heard the word

630
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.500
even the Rocky and thorny soils seemed to accept it

631
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.100
seemed to receive it. But the

632
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.600
only one of the four soils that actually produced fruit

633
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.500
was the good soil.

634
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.600
one fourth of this illustration is actually

635
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.400
his

636
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.700
And if you think okay that that's why

637
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.300
I want to be good soil. But then what happens when that seed is planted

638
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.300
in the soil just like that plant can't produce fruit on its own unless

639
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.700
it remains in the soil that's nourishing it

640
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.300
you and I cannot produce the fruit of

641
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.500
God unless we abide in Jesus.

642
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.200
It's John 15. The whole point of that is that

643
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.300
when we abide in Jesus, he will

644
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.600
produce fruit through us.

645
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.400
And fruit that glorifies him not glorifies us.

646
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.200
The fruit is cherished by other people.

647
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.300
And it's honoring.

648
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.300
The lord of the Harvest it's what Matthew 5 says

649
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.100
that Jesus says let your light shine before others. So

650
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.400
they may see your good works. Yes, that that might bring arrogance and

651
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.400
pride when I think now look they're gonna watch us do good things all

652
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.200
this. No, he says let them see your good works and give

653
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.500
glory to your father who is in heaven.

654
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.200
That's where the glory goes whenever you produce the

655
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.600
fruit. God is producing through you.

656
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.900
It's his work.

657
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.900
So we want to be good soil, right?

658
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.300
Clearly of the four it's a simple Parable. That's what the parables

659
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.100
are. So simple. Yes, so deep, right.

660
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.100
We want to be good soil. We need to be good soil. How do

661
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.200
you ensure that you are?

662
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.600
And that you'll be able to produce this good fruit.

663
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.400
Well first remember

664
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.000
the nature of God's Kingdom

665
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.500
you are good soil when you make sure

666
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.500
your heart is soft and broken

667
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.200
and humble.

668
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.300
So that the word of God can take root

669
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:22.800
in it.

670
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.500
That you recognize your fallenness you recognize your

671
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.500
need for him. You truly grasp. You can't save yourself.

672
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.200
You can do nothing on your own you say all of that.

673
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.400
You mean it in your heart and you come to him for help. You

674
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.300
don't try to do it yourself. You don't try to say I can handle this

675
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.800
I can buck up. I can strengthen up. I can do these things myself.

676
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.200
I don't need God you don't say that at all. You say

677
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.500
God. I can't do nothing apart from you.

678
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.700
And when you repent and turn away from that hardness

679
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.400
from that fear from that worldliness and you

680
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.800
say God I'm done with that and I want you you come

681
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.200
to him and Faith. That's when he makes you good

682
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:02.500
soil.

683
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.200
You can't make yourself good soil. That's what

684
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.700
he does in you.

685
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.400
So if you have ears to hear Church listen to this today, Jesus is

686
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.900
calling right now.

687
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.600
He's saying to you unbeliever. Come to me

688
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.700
to be good soil. He's saying to you believer with rocky soil

689
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.900
right now with thorny Soul right now, he's saying come to me.

690
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.900
Come to me. I will make you good soil. I'll

691
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.400
make you listen. He say I'll make you the kind of soul that

692
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.000
doesn't care if there's birds flying around.

693
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.600
That doesn't care. If the Sun is scorching. It doesn't matter

694
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.200
if Thorns are growing up because I'm gonna rip them out.

695
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.100
He wants you to be that kind of soil.

696
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.300
And he'll make you that good soil because then what

697
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.700
he does with that good soil. Is he produces good fruit that glorifies him?

698
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.400
And good fruit that benefits others as he takes that fruit.

699
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.000
Just imagine that take the metaphor a little

700
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.300
bit further, right? He takes that fruit and he opens it up. He takes

701
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.400
the seeds out of that and he begins to plant it in other

702
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.700
other fields around the world nearby us

703
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.200
to the ends of the Earth wherever he's taking

704
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.600
our fruit and he's producing more and more

705
