WEBVTT

1
00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:52.305
Well, good morning church, uh, grace

2
00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:54.065
and peace to you from God, our father

3
00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:55.465
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4
00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:59.425
I pray that you've had a good week thawing out in some ways.

5
00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:03.345
Uh, unfortunately our building didn't do that very well

6
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:06.025
as we had a pipe burst back there

7
00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:09.385
and it, uh, flooded classrooms down into the worship center,

8
00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.145
all into the lobby and even down into the cafe.

9
00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:15.065
And, uh, so yeah,

10
00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:18.105
but we're grateful that had a bunch

11
00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:19.105
of people helping clean up,

12
00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:21.065
had a restoration company get out here pretty quickly

13
00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:23.825
and that the Lord is still good.

14
00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:25.745
Amen. Yeah,

15
00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:28.505
just gonna be a little flexibility over the next couple.

16
00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:29.705
Hopefully not too long,

17
00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:33.985
but weeks maybe of adjusting, moving, seeing some

18
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:35.905
drywall ripped off again.

19
00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:37.945
Here we go, right? So, yeah.

20
00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.225
But, uh, just another quick update.

21
00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:43.145
I am having arthroscopic surgery on my knee tomorrow,

22
00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:44.705
scheduled for tomorrow at least,

23
00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:47.225
and, uh, clean up the meniscus a little bit.

24
00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:48.465
So appreciate your prayers for that.

25
00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:51.705
But if you're new around here, we are excited

26
00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:54.265
that you would choose to welcome to worship with us today.

27
00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:56.265
We hope you are welcomed and encouraged

28
00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:59.185
and, uh, felt like you connect here.

29
00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.225
We'd love to help you do that.

30
00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:02.105
Uh, we know it's hard to jump into a new place

31
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.065
and still wanna help you as best we can do that.

32
00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:07.225
So please come let us know who you are either here in the

33
00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:09.465
front, there's a QR code in the seat back in front of you,

34
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:11.625
or the new here area out there.

35
00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:13.665
We'd love to just say hi to you that way.

36
00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:18.025
But we are journeying through, uh, the core doctrines

37
00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:19.505
of our faith in this series

38
00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.385
that we're calling First Things First.

39
00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:24.865
And so let's just remember where we've come so far.

40
00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:26.265
You see the video weekly,

41
00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:29.425
but uh, we're gonna just kinda recap a little bit.

42
00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:32.425
And so what was the first big rock

43
00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:34.545
that we studied a couple weeks ago?

44
00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:39.525
Anybody remember Revelation?

45
00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:40.605
Yeah, that's right. Okay,

46
00:02:40.605 --> 00:02:41.805
so we're gonna put that one in here.

47
00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.845
Revelation that God has told us about himself.

48
00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:48.005
Otherwise we wouldn't know much if anything about him. Okay?

49
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.565
So that was the first week, then the second one last week.

50
00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:55.755
Uh, what was that one? Man,

51
00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:57.635
we're really on ball with this, aren't we?

52
00:02:58.255 --> 00:03:00.565
Uh, the attributes of God, right? Yeah.

53
00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:01.605
A couple of you got that one.

54
00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:05.445
This was the fact of what God is and who God is.

55
00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:07.045
Remember, we're putting these things in first

56
00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:08.325
'cause they're the most important things.

57
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:11.485
So, uh, then we're gonna get to today.

58
00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:14.925
Now, this one is one of the most important, yet one

59
00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:17.525
of the most difficult of rocks

60
00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:19.605
that we will study in this way.

61
00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:23.005
It is the Trinity. The Trinity.

62
00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:26.405
So that is one foundational doctrine today.

63
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:30.725
And more than any other, this is the distinctive belief

64
00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.685
that is biblical Christianity.

65
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:38.085
Th this is also even separating us from groups

66
00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:40.285
that would claim to be Christian as well.

67
00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:45.925
This one will be distinct from that as we get into it.

68
00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.685
Again, though, let me just be clear,

69
00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:53.125
it is incredibly difficult for us as humans who are limited

70
00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:58.045
to grasp this idea of the Trinity.

71
00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:01.525
So you might be tempted right now, like, boy, I'm not ready

72
00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:02.685
to think this early in the morning.

73
00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:06.445
I'm just gonna check out, please don't,

74
00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.085
because I, I read this longer

75
00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:11.325
quote as it's been said this way.

76
00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:13.405
Here's the beautiful thing. You don't need

77
00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:16.645
to fully understand the Trinity to worship the Trinity.

78
00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:21.645
Pray to the Trinity and enter into the life of the Trinity.

79
00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:24.965
They tell me that deep within the core of the sun,

80
00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:27.245
the temperature is 27 million degrees.

81
00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:31.925
The pressure is 340 billion times what is here on Earth.

82
00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:35.725
And in the sun's core, that insanely hot temperature

83
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:38.005
and unthinkable pressure combined

84
00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:41.285
to create nuclear reactions in each reaction,

85
00:04:41.355 --> 00:04:44.485
four protons fused together to create one alpha particle,

86
00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:47.765
which is 0.7% less massive than the four protons.

87
00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:51.125
The difference in mass is expelled this energy

88
00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:53.205
and through a process called convection,

89
00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:55.965
this energy from the core of the sun reaches the surface

90
00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.845
where it's expelled as heat and light.

91
00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:02.645
Now, that was all kind of interesting, but you know what?

92
00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:06.005
I didn't need to know all that in order to get a tan.

93
00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:13.245
So listen, as we study this today,

94
00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:16.925
there's gonna be a whole lot of questions left unanswered.

95
00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:21.045
Much of this is gonna be hard for us to understand

96
00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:24.805
because the reality of this is, it is a mystery.

97
00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:27.755
The Trinity is a mystery.

98
00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:33.605
We're trying to materialize something that is immaterial.

99
00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:40.325
We we have limited human language

100
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:43.285
that is incapable of describing something that's

101
00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:44.365
beyond creation.

102
00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:49.705
But that does not mean we shouldn't try

103
00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:51.385
to understand better, right?

104
00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:58.365
Because while the Trinity is a mystery, yes, we can learn

105
00:05:58.745 --> 00:06:01.205
to speak well of this topic

106
00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:04.365
and how to speak well about it.

107
00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:07.015
We're just gonna have to be really careful

108
00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:08.535
as we do it, right?

109
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.535
So even as I sit here

110
00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.455
and I'm teaching this for the next few minutes, like

111
00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:14.815
in many ways I'm walking a knife edge.

112
00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:20.375
I don't want to detract from the glory of God in any way,

113
00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:25.495
And I don't want to drift into heresy that is

114
00:06:25.595 --> 00:06:27.575
so easy to do with this topic.

115
00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.775
And we'll talk about some of those things.

116
00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:32.335
And so there's like this sense of, of excitement

117
00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:36.175
because I, I'm, I, I have grown more this week

118
00:06:37.435 --> 00:06:40.695
in my theological understanding than probably the five years

119
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.135
before that, that I've been here

120
00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:46.775
because it forced me to study deeply

121
00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.455
in a hard, hard topic.

122
00:06:49.515 --> 00:06:51.855
But I, I just really wanna be careful with it.

123
00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:53.415
And we need to be careful as we go.

124
00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:55.335
And so, so lemme just be clear,

125
00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:56.975
we're all walking this journey together.

126
00:06:57.405 --> 00:07:00.455
Like I'm growing, I'm learning, I'm experiencing things

127
00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:01.775
and, and seeing things.

128
00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:04.575
We're asking questions, we're all seeking answers.

129
00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:05.975
Like we're all gonna walk away from this

130
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.255
with more questions in some ways.

131
00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:12.495
And so as we study these kinds of things, all the big rocks,

132
00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:15.055
let's be humble and,

133
00:07:15.115 --> 00:07:18.695
and let's trust God in it,

134
00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:21.795
that he will grow our understanding,

135
00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:24.035
he will grow our knowledge.

136
00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:28.515
And in that he will grow our love for him as well.

137
00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:31.555
So let's ask him for some help.

138
00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:36.085
Now, God, thank you for, for the ideas

139
00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:41.365
that, that we have seen the last couple weeks of

140
00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:43.725
you telling us about yourself

141
00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:46.605
and you telling us what you are, who you are.

142
00:07:47.955 --> 00:07:51.085
This is one of those huge pieces of that.

143
00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:56.515
And it's so far beyond us God.

144
00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:02.955
So lead us to see a, just a glimpse today, all of us kids,

145
00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:08.035
students, adults, that we all walk away with some measure

146
00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:11.675
of deeper understanding and greater love for you.

147
00:08:15.215 --> 00:08:17.115
But Holy Spirit, we need your help for that.

148
00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:20.155
We need you to be the, the revealer of truth

149
00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:24.435
that you say you would be to guide us into all truth.

150
00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:28.075
Start with that today, God, for your glory

151
00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:29.955
and our good in Jesus authority.

152
00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:35.155
Amen. So we're gonna walk a journey

153
00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:36.355
today to try to understand.

154
00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.795
So first what we need to see is

155
00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:41.195
what I've just talked termed here, the equation

156
00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:43.915
of the Trinity students.

157
00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:45.315
This is math class, right?

158
00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:47.795
The equation of the trinity,

159
00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:49.635
and what do we even mean when we say trinity?

160
00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:51.675
Let's just get that on the table first.

161
00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:53.875
We'll break the word down first.

162
00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:57.005
So you have try, which means three,

163
00:08:57.345 --> 00:08:59.365
and you have unity, which means one.

164
00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:02.005
So you might even say try unity Trinity

165
00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:05.565
three in one, one in three.

166
00:09:05.705 --> 00:09:07.165
That's Trinity.

167
00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:09.885
And so lemme give you just a couple phrases that you might

168
00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:12.725
somewhat simply be able to say

169
00:09:12.795 --> 00:09:14.205
what we're talking about here.

170
00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:16.875
There's only one God,

171
00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:23.875
that God exists eternally in three persons,

172
00:09:24.415 --> 00:09:26.155
father, son, spirit,

173
00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:31.715
and these three are equal in divinity

174
00:09:32.495 --> 00:09:34.475
and possess the same essence.

175
00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:37.155
Now you're like, that's not simple.

176
00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:39.395
Okay, well, I get it right, but,

177
00:09:39.395 --> 00:09:41.315
but those statements don't build off each other.

178
00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:43.955
Like you don't start with one sequentially to the next one.

179
00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:46.275
It it, it's also like we, we have

180
00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:47.915
to accept them all simultaneously.

181
00:09:48.135 --> 00:09:49.355
And this is where it starts to get a

182
00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.635
little, little difficult.

183
00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:51.915
Accept them simultaneously.

184
00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:56.275
Again, one God, three persons, same divine essence.

185
00:09:58.635 --> 00:09:59.835
I know this is hard, so, so

186
00:09:59.835 --> 00:10:01.075
because we're visual people,

187
00:10:02.015 --> 00:10:04.115
I'm gonna give you a couple classic illustrations

188
00:10:04.695 --> 00:10:07.115
for the Trinity and you see 'em on the screen.

189
00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:09.715
You've, you've probably seen these in some way before.

190
00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:13.755
Now there's a danger as soon as I do this, there's a danger

191
00:10:13.755 --> 00:10:16.315
because pictures are always limited.

192
00:10:18.465 --> 00:10:20.435
Like the, there's you,

193
00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:22.435
you cannot fully describe the trinity.

194
00:10:22.545 --> 00:10:24.275
Even with pictures like this, even

195
00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:25.475
with multiple pictures put together,

196
00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:28.555
you can't get all the way there,

197
00:10:29.615 --> 00:10:30.955
but they can help us a little bit.

198
00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:34.355
So they're not just wa baby out with bath water, right?

199
00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:35.955
Like a little bit of help here

200
00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:39.155
where you can see on the left, just as I explained those,

201
00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.955
those levels, those uh, phrases, the one of the left,

202
00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:44.515
you can see that each person is fully God,

203
00:10:46.575 --> 00:10:48.115
but the father is not the son.

204
00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:49.475
The son is not the spirit.

205
00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:51.035
The spirit's not the father, right?

206
00:10:51.095 --> 00:10:55.195
You can see that there's three persons, but one God

207
00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:56.835
and they're not the same.

208
00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:00.595
The problem here, just look at the left one,

209
00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:02.395
the problem here is that that can lead us to think

210
00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.835
that there are parts of God

211
00:11:07.055 --> 00:11:09.315
That's not helpful because there's been said

212
00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:13.475
before, all that is in God is God, right?

213
00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:15.155
So we're not saying like composition,

214
00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:18.995
these three make up parts of God a third, a third, a third.

215
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.715
No, that's not what we're saying with that. It's not true.

216
00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:25.075
That's why the other triangle balances.

217
00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:28.795
It was saying that the trinity really exists in the,

218
00:11:28.965 --> 00:11:30.275
in-between, right?

219
00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:32.915
Those lines that go between the triangle.

220
00:11:34.015 --> 00:11:35.755
You could even show arrows on there that,

221
00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:37.995
that talk about the relationships between father, son,

222
00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:41.035
spirit, the son, begotten spirit proceeding.

223
00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:43.435
We could get into that a long time, but,

224
00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:46.755
but really this is the only way we can distinguish

225
00:11:47.345 --> 00:11:48.995
between the persons of the Trinity

226
00:11:50.225 --> 00:11:53.965
because God is one, right?

227
00:11:55.225 --> 00:11:58.725
So father, son Spirit are really the same except

228
00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:01.525
for the fact that God's revealed it like this,

229
00:12:03.025 --> 00:12:05.125
the relationships with the Father, son, and spirit.

230
00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:07.845
That's the only way we know any difference on our side.

231
00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:09.445
That's what we call the economic trinity.

232
00:12:09.445 --> 00:12:13.485
That we, we meet the trinity in those ways.

233
00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:17.325
So I can try to explain it, but, but we need to go back

234
00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:21.045
and see what people have actually done to formulate words

235
00:12:21.355 --> 00:12:23.645
that will help us have good language about this.

236
00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.325
One of those, the foundational statements is called the nice

237
00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:29.685
scene creed, uh, spoke against heresies that,

238
00:12:29.835 --> 00:12:31.365
that were at the time especially,

239
00:12:31.365 --> 00:12:35.405
but even today saying Jesus was created by the Father

240
00:12:35.425 --> 00:12:38.045
and Jesus is lesser than the Father in some way.

241
00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:41.165
And, and this was originally written in 3 25,

242
00:12:42.185 --> 00:12:46.125
so many years ago, 3 25 ad but then enlarged in 3 81.

243
00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:47.205
And and in part it says this,

244
00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:48.805
we're gonna put on the screen, it's on your notes.

245
00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:54.285
It says, we believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker

246
00:12:54.385 --> 00:12:57.485
of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.

247
00:12:58.265 --> 00:13:02.525
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God,

248
00:13:02.725 --> 00:13:03.965
begotten from the Father

249
00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:07.405
before all ages, light from light,

250
00:13:07.715 --> 00:13:11.285
true God from true God, begotten, not made

251
00:13:12.265 --> 00:13:15.045
of one substance with the Father

252
00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:18.805
and in the Holy Spirit, the Lord

253
00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:22.685
and life giver who proceeds from the Father, who

254
00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:25.725
with the Father and the Son is together, worshiped

255
00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:30.355
and together glorified a lot of words.

256
00:13:30.715 --> 00:13:34.515
I get it. But these were church fathers we might say,

257
00:13:34.535 --> 00:13:36.955
who were thinking about how do we explain

258
00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:38.195
what God's word says?

259
00:13:38.255 --> 00:13:40.915
And they formulated this phrasing

260
00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:43.035
and there's a lot more to, I just cut out that part

261
00:13:43.035 --> 00:13:45.075
of it here that says things about the trinity.

262
00:13:45.215 --> 00:13:46.915
Now lemme give you a, a couple keys.

263
00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:49.395
I know this is technical. Keep tracking with me on this.

264
00:13:50.215 --> 00:13:53.435
The key in all this is the distinction between person

265
00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:58.515
and substance or being or essence.

266
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:03.435
And you hear the word essential in the word essence, right?

267
00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:08.955
That which is essential to what something is.

268
00:14:10.505 --> 00:14:12.195
Okay? So, so let me give you an example.

269
00:14:12.195 --> 00:14:15.475
Like me, what kind of being am I?

270
00:14:19.365 --> 00:14:20.825
Why are you so slow with that? Why? Come on.

271
00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.505
Human being right? Like, I don't know.

272
00:14:27.855 --> 00:14:30.025
Okay. Students thought you'd be all over that one, right?

273
00:14:30.165 --> 00:14:33.705
Um, human being, okay, well

274
00:14:35.085 --> 00:14:39.425
the fact that God is one is essential to his being,

275
00:14:40.085 --> 00:14:41.745
to who he is.

276
00:14:41.765 --> 00:14:44.345
So Deuteronomy six, four is very clear with this hero,

277
00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:46.705
Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.

278
00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:52.805
That's just what God is, is one. We are monotheists.

279
00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:57.765
Big word that just means we believe in one God, mono one,

280
00:14:57.875 --> 00:15:00.765
theists God, one God, the being

281
00:15:01.065 --> 00:15:03.245
yet personhood is different.

282
00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:04.965
It's how someone is known.

283
00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:08.325
So yes, I'm a human being,

284
00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:13.685
but I'm known as John Wolgemuth, right?

285
00:15:13.745 --> 00:15:16.605
So that's, that's a unique human.

286
00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:18.725
That's some, that's a person.

287
00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:20.685
That's, that's the characteristics

288
00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:24.565
that I am just like you are unique as a human known as

289
00:15:25.585 --> 00:15:26.845
who you are, the person.

290
00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:29.925
So the, the three persons of the Trinity is

291
00:15:29.925 --> 00:15:31.445
how God has revealed himself.

292
00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:35.925
That's how we know him as father, son, holy Spirit.

293
00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:39.845
Yet again, still one God.

294
00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:44.045
It's almost, you could think like person is personality

295
00:15:44.385 --> 00:15:45.805
or qualities.

296
00:15:46.265 --> 00:15:48.845
The the conceptual idea

297
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:53.365
or theme of a person, like what comes to mind

298
00:15:54.235 --> 00:15:57.285
when you think about fill in the blank somebody's name.

299
00:15:58.145 --> 00:16:00.125
And it's not just that they're a being, it's

300
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.965
that there's a person there.

301
00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:06.245
And so that I, I put another quote from

302
00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:07.605
another creed on your notes.

303
00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:09.845
This one is the Ahan nation creed written

304
00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:11.005
around the fifth century.

305
00:16:11.855 --> 00:16:14.125
Again, heresies were popping up all around then.

306
00:16:14.145 --> 00:16:15.925
And so here's what they said.

307
00:16:15.925 --> 00:16:18.085
Notice the essence person's language.

308
00:16:19.105 --> 00:16:21.205
We worship one God in Trinity

309
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:26.445
and Trinity in unity, neither confounding the persons

310
00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:28.085
nor dividing the essence.

311
00:16:30.425 --> 00:16:33.005
For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son,

312
00:16:33.065 --> 00:16:34.445
and another of the Holy Spirit.

313
00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:37.285
But the Godhead of the Father of the Son

314
00:16:37.285 --> 00:16:38.845
and of the Holy Spirit is all one.

315
00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:44.925
The glory equal the majesty co-eternal, such

316
00:16:45.025 --> 00:16:47.525
as the Father is such as the Son

317
00:16:47.905 --> 00:16:49.485
and such as the Holy Spirit.

318
00:16:51.395 --> 00:16:55.215
So again, God eternally exists as three persons, father,

319
00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:56.615
son, holy Spirit.

320
00:16:57.005 --> 00:17:00.975
Each person is fully God. There's no subordinate in that.

321
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:03.855
And there is one God, not three,

322
00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.325
one in three, three in one.

323
00:17:07.325 --> 00:17:09.765
That's the idea we're getting to now

324
00:17:10.555 --> 00:17:12.805
already you're sitting there like, but,

325
00:17:12.945 --> 00:17:14.605
but what questions are coming up?

326
00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:17.045
So there, there's always, there's questions.

327
00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:20.965
Immediately you start to face the challenge of the trinity.

328
00:17:22.225 --> 00:17:25.165
So I just spent a few minutes walking through the basic idea

329
00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.365
of the Trinity, but there's a challenge

330
00:17:27.745 --> 00:17:29.845
or challenges that automatically come up

331
00:17:30.345 --> 00:17:31.605
as we start talking about this.

332
00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:36.245
One of the first pushbacks on this idea of the Trinity is

333
00:17:36.245 --> 00:17:39.515
that it's not in the Bible, right?

334
00:17:39.515 --> 00:17:41.875
This that's not there. You guys

335
00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:43.035
are just making this stuff up.

336
00:17:43.175 --> 00:17:45.635
So like we're just putting it all together Later.

337
00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:46.675
We kind of figured it out.

338
00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:48.355
Now we're putting it back into it.

339
00:17:48.695 --> 00:17:53.605
Now it is true that the word trinity is never in the Bible,

340
00:17:56.615 --> 00:17:58.795
But the concept is all over it.

341
00:18:00.335 --> 00:18:02.755
And so we're gonna see one evidence of that just today, uh,

342
00:18:02.755 --> 00:18:05.235
shortly in Mark one, nine through 11.

343
00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:06.915
So go ahead and grab your copy of God's word.

344
00:18:06.915 --> 00:18:11.875
Turn there with me. I want you to see this from God's word.

345
00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:13.475
We're not just going to talk about a lecture

346
00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:14.595
about the trinity today.

347
00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:16.915
This is in God's word. We're gonna study a little bit

348
00:18:16.975 --> 00:18:18.555
around it and in it

349
00:18:18.615 --> 00:18:21.235
and then jump around to some other passages.

350
00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:22.595
But Rome, uh, mark one,

351
00:18:24.975 --> 00:18:29.635
The context here is that the other miracle baby

352
00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:31.995
around Christmas, remember Jesus wasn't the only miracle.

353
00:18:32.105 --> 00:18:34.275
Baby at Christmas was unique, but,

354
00:18:35.015 --> 00:18:38.195
but John the Baptist was also uniquely given

355
00:18:38.775 --> 00:18:42.595
and God had called him to prepare the way of the Messiah.

356
00:18:43.975 --> 00:18:46.115
And so John was out in the wilderness proclaiming the

357
00:18:46.115 --> 00:18:48.515
people's need to repent and be baptized.

358
00:18:49.665 --> 00:18:51.955
Because Mark one look at verses seven

359
00:18:51.955 --> 00:18:55.955
and eight says, he preached saying after me.

360
00:18:56.375 --> 00:18:58.275
So this is why John was even out there preaching.

361
00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:02.035
He says, after me comes he who is mightier than I,

362
00:19:03.015 --> 00:19:04.475
the strap of who sandals.

363
00:19:04.535 --> 00:19:06.395
I'm not worthy to stoop down and untie.

364
00:19:07.505 --> 00:19:09.155
I've baptized you with water,

365
00:19:09.895 --> 00:19:12.435
but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

366
00:19:14.175 --> 00:19:16.875
So he recognizes something is about to happen

367
00:19:16.945 --> 00:19:18.955
that is way bigger than what he's doing.

368
00:19:21.415 --> 00:19:22.435
And look at what happens next.

369
00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:24.995
This is really the kickoff of Jesus's public ministry.

370
00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:28.595
He lived in obscurity for 30 years. Now he shows up.

371
00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:30.155
Look at this, verses nine through 11.

372
00:19:31.935 --> 00:19:35.395
In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee

373
00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:37.635
and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

374
00:19:39.955 --> 00:19:42.135
And when he came up outta the water, just,

375
00:19:42.135 --> 00:19:45.615
just imagine this scene in your head when he came up out

376
00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:49.775
of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open

377
00:19:50.515 --> 00:19:54.055
and the spirit descending on him like a dove.

378
00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.455
And a voice came from heaven.

379
00:19:58.955 --> 00:20:01.415
You are my beloved son

380
00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:05.215
With you, I'm well pleased.

381
00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:11.055
This is one of the most explicit evidences

382
00:20:11.055 --> 00:20:12.095
of the Trinity and scripture.

383
00:20:13.635 --> 00:20:17.415
All three persons of God are involved in this moment, right?

384
00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:19.655
You have the, the person of the Father

385
00:20:20.535 --> 00:20:22.935
speaking about his beloved son.

386
00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:26.855
You have Jesus the Son being baptized.

387
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:31.815
You have the spirit hovering down right away

388
00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:35.135
that defeats one of the heresies called modalism,

389
00:20:37.265 --> 00:20:40.975
which believes that the one God merely shows up in different

390
00:20:40.985 --> 00:20:43.575
forms at different times, different modes.

391
00:20:44.725 --> 00:20:45.975
Well, this, this is

392
00:20:46.685 --> 00:20:49.365
because then it's just Father here, Jesus there Spirit.

393
00:20:49.465 --> 00:20:51.445
No, this right here, they're all three involved.

394
00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:52.605
Now I know it can be confusing

395
00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:55.485
'cause it sure seems like they're

396
00:20:55.885 --> 00:20:57.845
separate entities, right?

397
00:20:57.865 --> 00:21:00.165
The Father, son Spirit, they're, they're separate.

398
00:21:01.075 --> 00:21:02.885
Like there's some kind of tri theism.

399
00:21:02.965 --> 00:21:06.205
I said, we're monotheists. This says are, are we Tri theus?

400
00:21:06.645 --> 00:21:10.885
Actually, well that's why we can't take just this verse

401
00:21:11.785 --> 00:21:14.405
in isolation from the rest of God's word.

402
00:21:15.185 --> 00:21:17.765
We can actually piece this together from all over the Bible,

403
00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:20.365
especially the New Testament.

404
00:21:21.675 --> 00:21:24.965
Matthew 1127, all things have been handed over to me.

405
00:21:24.975 --> 00:21:26.485
Jesus says by my father,

406
00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:29.325
no one knows the son except the Father.

407
00:21:30.025 --> 00:21:32.245
And no one knows the Father except the son

408
00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:34.925
and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him.

409
00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:38.805
You have just a page earlier from

410
00:21:38.805 --> 00:21:40.325
what we were reading in Mark Matthew 28,

411
00:21:41.105 --> 00:21:42.165
the Great Commission.

412
00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:45.005
We talk about this all the time. Notice what it says.

413
00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.565
Jesus came and said to them,

414
00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:50.045
all authority in heaven on earth has been given to me.

415
00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:54.205
Go therefore make disciples of all nations,

416
00:21:54.475 --> 00:21:57.845
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son

417
00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:00.245
and of the Holy Spirit teaching them

418
00:22:00.245 --> 00:22:02.445
to observe all that I've commanded you.

419
00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:07.085
Behold I am with you always to the end of the age.

420
00:22:07.145 --> 00:22:09.165
You hear that even when we do baptisms here, right?

421
00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:11.365
Father Son Spirit, there's this

422
00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:14.405
Trinitarian idea of baptism.

423
00:22:16.235 --> 00:22:19.485
Luke chapter one, the Holy Spirit conceived a baby in Mary's

424
00:22:19.525 --> 00:22:21.685
womb that would be called holy the Son of God.

425
00:22:24.175 --> 00:22:27.995
You can go read John 14 through 16, those three chapters,

426
00:22:28.105 --> 00:22:31.635
it's full, where Jesus is talking about his relationship

427
00:22:31.635 --> 00:22:33.915
with the Father, the sending of the Holy Spirit.

428
00:22:34.065 --> 00:22:36.195
It's all over those three chapters.

429
00:22:38.345 --> 00:22:41.775
Think about Acts two, after Jesus had ascended,

430
00:22:42.115 --> 00:22:45.415
the Holy Spirit miraculously filled God's people

431
00:22:45.595 --> 00:22:48.935
to declare God's works fulfilling Old Testament prophecy.

432
00:22:51.795 --> 00:22:56.545
Romans eight, like the pinnacle of Romans, says,

433
00:22:56.725 --> 00:23:00.665
God worked through the spirit of life in Christ Jesus

434
00:23:01.165 --> 00:23:03.585
to set us free from the law of sin and death.

435
00:23:05.595 --> 00:23:08.095
He even equates the spirit of God with the spirit of Christ,

436
00:23:08.185 --> 00:23:10.175
which prompts us to say, Abba Father,

437
00:23:12.115 --> 00:23:13.285
it's all right there.

438
00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:16.725
One Corinthians 12, the Spirit says it's the only way we can

439
00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:19.805
say Jesus' Lord, like so us even

440
00:23:19.825 --> 00:23:22.445
to be seeing Jesus means the spirit has

441
00:23:22.445 --> 00:23:24.645
to be working the spirit gifts, believers

442
00:23:25.065 --> 00:23:26.645
for faith and action.

443
00:23:26.715 --> 00:23:28.965
Galatians four, God sent forth,

444
00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:32.605
his son sent forth the spirit of the son as well.

445
00:23:33.635 --> 00:23:37.085
Ephesians one, there's the father's role, the son's role,

446
00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:39.005
the spirit's role in our salvation.

447
00:23:40.805 --> 00:23:45.025
And then Jude chapter one, the only chapter verses 20

448
00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:46.245
and 21 says this,

449
00:23:46.345 --> 00:23:49.565
but you beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy

450
00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:52.125
faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,

451
00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:56.365
keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy

452
00:23:56.425 --> 00:23:58.805
of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.

453
00:24:01.825 --> 00:24:04.525
So the pushback on the Trinity not being in the

454
00:24:04.525 --> 00:24:05.805
Bible is false.

455
00:24:07.545 --> 00:24:08.645
You just saw it, right?

456
00:24:08.645 --> 00:24:10.605
There's, there's even hints in the Old Testament.

457
00:24:10.605 --> 00:24:12.765
You can go through and find those as well.

458
00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:20.605
But even as I say that, that's absent from the Bible, that

459
00:24:20.605 --> 00:24:23.125
that's a challenge brought against us.

460
00:24:23.155 --> 00:24:25.525
Well there's another usually one that follows.

461
00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.725
It's that, okay, well the Trinity is

462
00:24:28.725 --> 00:24:29.765
just beyond our reasoning.

463
00:24:31.955 --> 00:24:33.205
It's, it's absent from the Bible.

464
00:24:33.235 --> 00:24:34.325
Okay, well then we've answered that,

465
00:24:34.325 --> 00:24:36.565
but no, okay, well then it's just beyond our reasoning.

466
00:24:36.565 --> 00:24:40.525
It's too much for us. Now we can't understand this.

467
00:24:43.645 --> 00:24:45.245
I mean, yeah, we could take all those verses,

468
00:24:45.445 --> 00:24:47.045
mash something together philosophically,

469
00:24:47.045 --> 00:24:48.565
but we really can't reason it out.

470
00:24:48.665 --> 00:24:51.365
It sounds so outlandish. It sounds crazy.

471
00:24:51.665 --> 00:24:52.685
We can't think of anything.

472
00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:58.085
And in one way that is actually true.

473
00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:05.285
We cannot come to faith by reason alone.

474
00:25:07.775 --> 00:25:12.585
We can't deduce it out. So I get it.

475
00:25:12.585 --> 00:25:15.225
It's difficult to, to think about this idea,

476
00:25:15.285 --> 00:25:17.305
but really we only have two choices here.

477
00:25:20.635 --> 00:25:25.455
We can be Unitarian, where God is exclusively one,

478
00:25:27.265 --> 00:25:30.055
which is what Islam says, which is what Judaism says.

479
00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:34.255
Others would say that that God is exclusively one.

480
00:25:34.255 --> 00:25:36.535
That's one option. Or we could be Trinitarian

481
00:25:38.765 --> 00:25:41.015
this one in three, three in one idea.

482
00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:42.455
And, and yes, it's a mystery.

483
00:25:42.455 --> 00:25:44.055
We just have to live in that mystery for a while.

484
00:25:47.665 --> 00:25:48.685
Yet. Yet here's, here's

485
00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:50.605
what happens when we have those challenges come our way

486
00:25:50.605 --> 00:25:52.485
because of that, we face those in the trinity.

487
00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:54.325
That can lead us to some dangers.

488
00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:57.365
If we're not careful, if we don't learn to speak well

489
00:25:58.145 --> 00:26:01.325
of this doctrine, we can get in trouble.

490
00:26:01.665 --> 00:26:03.965
The dangers of the Trinity.

491
00:26:05.145 --> 00:26:07.565
Here's the first danger is that we can hold wrong ideas.

492
00:26:09.715 --> 00:26:12.445
Okay? It's hard. Yes, we have to think.

493
00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:16.285
But that means we can also hold wrong ideas about the

494
00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:17.485
trinity, about God in general.

495
00:26:17.515 --> 00:26:19.165
This is what we call heresy.

496
00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:22.965
And this is throughout history, it's been this way.

497
00:26:22.965 --> 00:26:25.685
When it's wrong, ideas about God, that's heresy.

498
00:26:25.825 --> 00:26:29.405
And even metaphors can be this way.

499
00:26:31.825 --> 00:26:34.645
Now, analogies are helpful in some ways.

500
00:26:35.035 --> 00:26:37.805
They just cannot stand for the whole.

501
00:26:39.235 --> 00:26:40.285
Like you will not be able

502
00:26:40.285 --> 00:26:42.005
to explain the trinity with one analogy.

503
00:26:44.425 --> 00:26:45.885
And so I wanna give you some examples, right?

504
00:26:45.945 --> 00:26:48.005
So we can help explain subsections.

505
00:26:48.005 --> 00:26:49.365
But let me give you some examples.

506
00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:52.565
You might've heard this one. God is like water

507
00:26:54.985 --> 00:26:57.135
where you can find water in three different forms.

508
00:26:57.315 --> 00:27:00.535
You have solid liquid and vapor.

509
00:27:02.525 --> 00:27:06.775
Well, the problem is that is called modalism, where it just

510
00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:10.335
says that God is not three distinct persons,

511
00:27:10.335 --> 00:27:13.855
but merely reveals himself in three different forms, right?

512
00:27:14.015 --> 00:27:15.855
'cause water cannot be all three at the same time.

513
00:27:16.485 --> 00:27:19.455
It's either an iceberg or vapor

514
00:27:19.475 --> 00:27:22.735
or water at that moment.

515
00:27:24.845 --> 00:27:26.585
So a steaming iceberg is not helpful

516
00:27:26.965 --> 00:27:29.345
to us getting forward in this idea.

517
00:27:31.255 --> 00:27:32.545
What about God is the Son?

518
00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:34.665
You might've heard this one same picture from

519
00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:37.545
before, that there's a star, right?

520
00:27:38.805 --> 00:27:41.705
And it creates light. It creates heat.

521
00:27:41.955 --> 00:27:43.465
Sends those off from it.

522
00:27:43.465 --> 00:27:45.305
And you think that's a good analogy.

523
00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:50.205
Well, actually that's called Arianism, which said,

524
00:27:50.215 --> 00:27:52.165
which is one of these creeds written against it

525
00:27:52.165 --> 00:27:54.045
that the father created the son.

526
00:27:54.225 --> 00:27:55.765
The Father created the spirit.

527
00:27:57.035 --> 00:27:59.925
That there's subordination in that.

528
00:28:01.375 --> 00:28:05.855
Which by the way is not an old heresy.

529
00:28:05.965 --> 00:28:09.175
It's alive and well today. It's called Mormonism.

530
00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:11.615
It's called Jehovah's Witnesses

531
00:28:12.725 --> 00:28:17.035
That Say Jesus was created that makes them

532
00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:19.955
un-Christian in their beliefs.

533
00:28:24.175 --> 00:28:26.475
Here's another common example.

534
00:28:27.685 --> 00:28:30.875
Three, three leaf clover, right?

535
00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.435
This, this, that's helpful, right? There's three parts.

536
00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:35.715
But notice the word parts.

537
00:28:37.395 --> 00:28:40.135
That's partialism, which says that the father, son,

538
00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:41.695
and spirit are merely parts of God.

539
00:28:41.695 --> 00:28:45.215
That they're one third each to make up the whole.

540
00:28:47.785 --> 00:28:50.325
But that's, that's not all of God then, right?

541
00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:54.125
Or that the same man could be a husband,

542
00:28:54.285 --> 00:28:55.525
a father, and an employer.

543
00:28:55.705 --> 00:28:57.485
That's modalism again.

544
00:28:57.785 --> 00:29:00.005
Or like the an egg, maybe you thought of an egg

545
00:29:00.005 --> 00:29:01.085
that the shell and the white

546
00:29:01.085 --> 00:29:03.885
and the yolk are all parts of the egg.

547
00:29:04.225 --> 00:29:06.045
That's partialism again, right?

548
00:29:06.045 --> 00:29:08.565
You see how these, these metaphors can be so

549
00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:11.445
helpful in some ways, but really unhelpful.

550
00:29:11.645 --> 00:29:14.085
'cause it drifts into heresy actually very quickly,

551
00:29:16.965 --> 00:29:18.135
aspects illustrated.

552
00:29:18.395 --> 00:29:20.415
Yes. But they can't deliver all the goods.

553
00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:25.075
So what can happen then?

554
00:29:26.975 --> 00:29:29.155
If there's a possibility we hold wrong ideas about the

555
00:29:29.155 --> 00:29:30.715
Trinity, well then we just throw our hands up

556
00:29:30.715 --> 00:29:31.875
and say, I'm gonna forget it all.

557
00:29:31.915 --> 00:29:33.515
I don't even need to know anything.

558
00:29:33.575 --> 00:29:35.755
I'm gonna ignore all ideas about the Trinity.

559
00:29:35.955 --> 00:29:37.035
I don't even wanna know anything

560
00:29:37.035 --> 00:29:38.235
because I'm gonna get it wrong.

561
00:29:39.055 --> 00:29:42.245
We say forget it and ignore all ideas.

562
00:29:42.385 --> 00:29:43.845
But that's wrong too, isn't it?

563
00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:49.045
First, here's, here's the thing.

564
00:29:49.045 --> 00:29:51.405
I said this a couple weeks ago in a revelation if,

565
00:29:54.085 --> 00:29:57.825
if even if you try to not have beliefs about God,

566
00:29:58.605 --> 00:30:00.265
you will believe something.

567
00:30:01.775 --> 00:30:03.945
Because we're all theologians at heart.

568
00:30:04.045 --> 00:30:06.665
We all have this understanding of God in some way

569
00:30:07.175 --> 00:30:10.905
written on us and even then believed in us.

570
00:30:11.685 --> 00:30:15.945
And so we need to have as correct beliefs about God

571
00:30:16.005 --> 00:30:20.785
as we can continually growing in

572
00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:24.065
that we must try to understand God more.

573
00:30:26.765 --> 00:30:28.625
But we should also see it's important

574
00:30:28.695 --> 00:30:30.825
because God's word says it's important.

575
00:30:31.845 --> 00:30:33.745
We ought to think rightly about who God is

576
00:30:33.745 --> 00:30:35.145
as he's revealed himself in his word.

577
00:30:35.145 --> 00:30:38.065
That's why we shouldn't throw our hands up

578
00:30:38.105 --> 00:30:39.545
and say, I'm gonna ignore everything about this.

579
00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:41.185
I don't even need to think about it.

580
00:30:41.325 --> 00:30:42.945
No, God's word says it's important.

581
00:30:44.005 --> 00:30:45.265
So we need to make it important.

582
00:30:48.215 --> 00:30:50.865
That leads us to the necessity of the Trinity.

583
00:30:53.125 --> 00:30:57.305
Why is this so important? Why is this such a big deal?

584
00:30:58.645 --> 00:30:59.705
Why is it a big rock?

585
00:30:59.705 --> 00:31:01.865
Like why is it one of the things that we put in first?

586
00:31:01.965 --> 00:31:03.265
We can't leave it out.

587
00:31:06.425 --> 00:31:08.005
Why does this matter first?

588
00:31:08.005 --> 00:31:10.805
Because then we understand God better.

589
00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:18.265
We need to study this so that we understand God better.

590
00:31:20.495 --> 00:31:21.785
Like I just said, it shouldn't.

591
00:31:21.785 --> 00:31:25.105
We want to understand and know God better.

592
00:31:25.105 --> 00:31:26.465
Like shouldn't we hunger?

593
00:31:26.775 --> 00:31:31.425
Shouldn't we thirst to grasp more of who God is?

594
00:31:34.635 --> 00:31:37.175
And we saw this some last week with God's attributes, but

595
00:31:37.235 --> 00:31:39.895
but again, as I grew this week in my theological

596
00:31:39.895 --> 00:31:43.295
understanding of the Trinity, like I just sat here

597
00:31:44.315 --> 00:31:46.535
at my desk, I just sat stunned

598
00:31:49.665 --> 00:31:51.475
that this God

599
00:31:54.135 --> 00:31:55.985
that I could not fully conceive of,

600
00:31:56.165 --> 00:31:57.865
I'm still still asking questions.

601
00:31:58.205 --> 00:32:00.745
But then the more you grow in it,

602
00:32:00.745 --> 00:32:02.505
the more you're just stunned in awe

603
00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:07.025
and love for who He's, I mean,

604
00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:10.785
just think God is so big beyond comprehension.

605
00:32:10.935 --> 00:32:14.625
He's eternal. He's omnipotent. He's the creator.

606
00:32:15.015 --> 00:32:16.305
He's the sovereign one.

607
00:32:16.485 --> 00:32:19.905
He is one in three, three in one, able to be

608
00:32:19.925 --> 00:32:22.105
and do that in a way we could never understand.

609
00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:25.505
This is who God is.

610
00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:31.945
Yet at the same time, he is all of that.

611
00:32:32.605 --> 00:32:35.865
Not in an aloof separated kind of way,

612
00:32:37.365 --> 00:32:40.445
but like he's some watchmaker up there, clock maker,

613
00:32:40.445 --> 00:32:42.325
setting it in stone, letting it go.

614
00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:44.685
And he's completely separated from it.

615
00:32:44.785 --> 00:32:48.525
No, he is near to us at the same time.

616
00:32:48.525 --> 00:32:49.925
Deuteronomy 31, 8.

617
00:32:50.025 --> 00:32:53.005
It is the Lord that's Yahweh who goes before you.

618
00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:57.525
He will be with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.

619
00:32:57.825 --> 00:33:00.485
Do not fear or be dismayed.

620
00:33:00.665 --> 00:33:04.485
So listen, when you think about how big God is,

621
00:33:04.825 --> 00:33:07.885
how massive incomprehensible he is,

622
00:33:08.185 --> 00:33:10.685
and then he says to you, I'm gonna be with you.

623
00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:12.725
Is that not a measure of confidence?

624
00:33:15.855 --> 00:33:18.915
And no matter what you face, like no matter

625
00:33:19.025 --> 00:33:20.955
what I'm walking into this week

626
00:33:23.195 --> 00:33:26.005
that God says, I am with

627
00:33:26.005 --> 00:33:27.005
You.

628
00:33:30.655 --> 00:33:34.145
What courage, what joy,

629
00:33:35.915 --> 00:33:36.965
what peace that

630
00:33:37.125 --> 00:33:38.125
Comes from that.

631
00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:43.205
And so it helps us understand God better.

632
00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:46.885
So we know him better and we love him more.

633
00:33:46.885 --> 00:33:49.645
And we have confidence that this God of the universe is for

634
00:33:49.665 --> 00:33:53.805
Us, But we also need the Trinity

635
00:33:53.805 --> 00:33:56.085
to help us understand salvation better.

636
00:33:58.355 --> 00:34:00.285
Like we understand God better because of this,

637
00:34:00.865 --> 00:34:03.565
but to understand salvation better.

638
00:34:06.015 --> 00:34:08.635
See, when we think about salvation, it's easy for us

639
00:34:09.815 --> 00:34:12.555
to think that Jesus was on some solo mission,

640
00:34:14.345 --> 00:34:16.195
that Jesus was doing his own thing.

641
00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:17.835
And it's really cool that he did it,

642
00:34:18.455 --> 00:34:20.075
but we kind of leave him on his own.

643
00:34:22.655 --> 00:34:25.755
But that's wrong. And it actually limits

644
00:34:27.335 --> 00:34:31.435
the beauty and power of our salvation

645
00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:38.055
'cause Listen, before the foundation of the world,

646
00:34:40.685 --> 00:34:45.345
God existed in perfect community, perfect fulfillment.

647
00:34:46.645 --> 00:34:49.985
He is self-sustaining. He needs nothing.

648
00:34:50.045 --> 00:34:51.505
We saw that Acts 17 last week.

649
00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:57.245
He does not have to do anything outside of himself. Yet.

650
00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:58.485
What did God do?

651
00:35:01.615 --> 00:35:02.645
Think about what he did. How does

652
00:35:02.645 --> 00:35:03.725
it help us understand salvation?

653
00:35:03.725 --> 00:35:06.405
What did he do? What we see revealed in scripture is

654
00:35:06.405 --> 00:35:09.485
that God, the Father, created the universe

655
00:35:09.865 --> 00:35:13.765
and he predestined and he called to salvation.

656
00:35:14.465 --> 00:35:17.965
God, the Son took on flesh to save us

657
00:35:18.265 --> 00:35:19.525
and make us like him.

658
00:35:19.825 --> 00:35:22.525
And then God, the Spirit sanctifies us,

659
00:35:22.815 --> 00:35:26.165
makes us the holy temple of God in him.

660
00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:32.585
That's what he did. He didn't have to, he didn't need,

661
00:35:32.585 --> 00:35:35.185
he wasn't looking ahead like he wasn't wanting the

662
00:35:35.185 --> 00:35:36.705
pitter-patter of little feet in heaven,

663
00:35:36.805 --> 00:35:38.845
and he was lacking something.

664
00:35:38.985 --> 00:35:40.885
So he is, I'm gonna create people and I'm gonna save them.

665
00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:44.685
He didn't need anything. And yet he chose

666
00:35:45.385 --> 00:35:48.885
to create, know it was gonna fall apart, save,

667
00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:50.685
redeem, sanctify.

668
00:35:50.745 --> 00:35:52.445
He did all of that.

669
00:35:52.545 --> 00:35:55.725
But remember this, the three persons

670
00:35:55.805 --> 00:35:57.805
of the Trinity were not working on their own.

671
00:36:00.695 --> 00:36:02.465
There's only one will in God.

672
00:36:03.405 --> 00:36:06.585
And that will in the Trinity was to

673
00:36:06.655 --> 00:36:07.655
Save.

674
00:36:09.365 --> 00:36:13.505
That's what he did, does will do.

675
00:36:13.685 --> 00:36:16.985
And the whole Trinity involved in every part of salvation.

676
00:36:17.325 --> 00:36:20.225
So don't think the Son does this, the Father's act.

677
00:36:20.325 --> 00:36:23.785
No, the Father also redeems the Father also sanctifies the

678
00:36:23.805 --> 00:36:25.545
Son also was a part of creation, right?

679
00:36:25.545 --> 00:36:29.185
Hebrews one, the Spirit was also redeeming creating.

680
00:36:29.365 --> 00:36:30.545
That's all part of it.

681
00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:36.865
I love what Gregory of Nazi Anis said in the 300 said,

682
00:36:36.865 --> 00:36:41.745
this, no sooner do I place before the mind the one, no.

683
00:36:41.745 --> 00:36:44.265
No sooner do I think about the one than I'm surrounded

684
00:36:44.265 --> 00:36:45.385
by the splendor of the three.

685
00:36:46.165 --> 00:36:48.705
No sooner do I distinguish the three than I'm brought back

686
00:36:48.705 --> 00:36:52.065
to the one when any one of the three appears to me.

687
00:36:52.185 --> 00:36:53.825
I think of him as a whole.

688
00:36:53.935 --> 00:36:56.865
When again, I consider the three together I perceive,

689
00:36:56.925 --> 00:37:00.785
but one splendor and I cannot divide or measure the light.

690
00:37:00.855 --> 00:37:05.395
That is one. So just know this,

691
00:37:05.395 --> 00:37:09.395
that when we sing these songs to Jesus

692
00:37:09.855 --> 00:37:14.705
as the king, we mean the triune God.

693
00:37:15.135 --> 00:37:19.605
Also, right? When we ask the Spirit

694
00:37:19.985 --> 00:37:23.685
to help us avoid sin, we mean Trinity.

695
00:37:26.265 --> 00:37:29.765
Father, help spirit, help son help. Just think.

696
00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:31.245
Just think how that opens up.

697
00:37:31.245 --> 00:37:34.965
The power involved in our salvation.

698
00:37:37.325 --> 00:37:40.975
This is all of God involved in all of salvation

699
00:37:40.975 --> 00:37:42.575
because here's this, here's this reality.

700
00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:45.695
The problem we have with sin is that it's against God.

701
00:37:47.875 --> 00:37:49.855
And so we need all of God

702
00:37:50.155 --> 00:37:52.215
to be involved in all of our salvation.

703
00:37:55.395 --> 00:37:59.565
There's not parts, not components working against each other

704
00:37:59.785 --> 00:38:02.405
or in any way to combat one another.

705
00:38:03.505 --> 00:38:05.845
All of God is involved in all of our salvation.

706
00:38:05.905 --> 00:38:07.965
So listen, this is a mystery,

707
00:38:10.535 --> 00:38:12.475
but it is so foundational for our

708
00:38:12.475 --> 00:38:13.475
Faith.

709
00:38:16.425 --> 00:38:19.245
But I want you to be clear in your head, as I've wrestled

710
00:38:19.245 --> 00:38:22.285
with this all week, that it's okay for this to be so far

711
00:38:22.285 --> 00:38:27.225
beyond us because if God

712
00:38:27.325 --> 00:38:31.105
was small enough for our finite brains to understand him,

713
00:38:32.565 --> 00:38:34.265
he wouldn't be big enough to save us.

714
00:38:37.105 --> 00:38:39.805
We need God to be this big.

715
00:38:40.515 --> 00:38:44.645
Then he can be our savior. Romans 11 says it very well.

716
00:38:44.705 --> 00:38:48.765
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God.

717
00:38:49.185 --> 00:38:51.445
How unsearchable are his judgements?

718
00:38:51.825 --> 00:38:52.925
How inscrutable

719
00:38:53.305 --> 00:38:57.765
or uncorrectable are his ways for who has known the mind

720
00:38:57.765 --> 00:39:01.245
of the Lord or who has been His counselor?

721
00:39:03.785 --> 00:39:05.485
God is God. We are

722
00:39:05.485 --> 00:39:08.805
not yet.

723
00:39:09.875 --> 00:39:14.215
He has told us about himself A

724
00:39:14.515 --> 00:39:16.295
and even better.

725
00:39:16.995 --> 00:39:18.935
He has come to us to save us.

726
00:39:21.825 --> 00:39:23.965
How great is our God? Amen.

727
00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.005
Amen. Amen.
