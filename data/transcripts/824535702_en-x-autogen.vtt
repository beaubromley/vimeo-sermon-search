00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:11.100
here

2
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
It is great to be with you once again.

3
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.500
And I am especially excited about today. Not

4
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.500
just because it's seeing your

5
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.700
Sunday. I have a daughter who's a senior this this year as

6
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.800
well.

7
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.300
And so

8
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
You know, this is exciting time, right?

9
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.900
Life transition about to go Brave the the

10
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.100
world that you haven't known before about to go off to college.

11
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.500
These are exciting times and to all these seniors. I want

12
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.800
to commend you for your hard work.

13
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800
I'm excited for you. I'll say it just like

14
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.500
I said to my daughter we believe in you.

15
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.300
And we believe what God can do in and through your life. So you're about

16
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.300
to kind of leave the nest so to speak and faith

17
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.900
and brave a brand new

18
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.300
world and in many ways a strange world, but

19
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.500
that's part of the fun right to go

20
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.600
to places. You've never been

21
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600
To Adventure go into an adventure that you've never been a part

22
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.100
of and so I just want to let you know that.

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.500
We're praying for you. We believe in you and I know

24
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.900
this church family is going to be praying for you and cheering

25
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.500
you on as you go into your next steps.

26
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.200
These are strange days some of you have been asking. How

27
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.200
are you and how is OBU is doing very well.

28
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.000
We have about a 12 to 24 month overall recovery,

29
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.700
but I'm very happy to tell you that we

30
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.800
are back in classes on campus. We had

31
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.300
a big Community party yesterday. We had

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.900
live music we were able to do one of our shows, you

33
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.300
know, every year we do a show.

34
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.700
Where we have students who do performances and so

35
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.800
obviously because of tornado things were

36
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.800
had to be shifted a little bit but we

37
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.400
were able to do that in the lawn yesterday

38
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.500
outside our stadium and it

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.100
was absolutely a blast. So we had a few

40
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.300
hundred people there playing games

41
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.100
listen to live music and it was just such

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.600
a good reminder that God can renew even broken things

43
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.500
and that's what I've experienced in the past couple weeks

44
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.800
and I just want to encourage you that's what we can experience

45
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.500
as well. And in fact, that's where we are in

46
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.000
the Book of Joel we've seen in the early half of

47
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.500
the book.

48
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.400
words of judgment

49
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.100
But now we're in the part of the book that emphasizes restoration.

50
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.600
and renewal and in fact, we're in the second section today

51
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.500
in Joel 2:28 to 32 that

52
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.500
focuses on a promise

53
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.700
of restoration, but

54
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.700
Before I get there, I do want to

55
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.200
invite you. We do have an OBU alumni

56
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.300
friend perspective student luncheon. If you want to come it's

57
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.200
immediately after the second service. I believe it's in

58
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.400
the choir room. And I don't know we usually have really

59
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.700
good things to eat there and some fun things to take

60
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.600
away. I'm not sure exactly what

61
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.900
all is going to be there for you, but I'll be there and

62
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.900
I'd love to talk with you about what God's doing on bison Hill.

63
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.300
So if you're a prospective student or an alumni or a

64
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.000
friend or just an interesting party, or maybe you just want to free lunch,

65
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.800
that's fine, too.

66
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You can come.

67
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.200
I'll see you there.

68
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.500
All right.

69
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.200
I've said that Joel that we're in this section of renewal. Let

70
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.800
me tell you a little bit about renewal renewal

71
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.200
is when something that is dilapidated or

72
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.500
something that is old or tired or something

73
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.800
that is about to die or maybe even dead

74
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.800
has come back to life. It's renewed.

75
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.200
Well, that's what we're talking about in Joel.

76
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.700
title of today's messages a call that saves now I

77
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.800
am a weird history buff my

78
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.100
periods of history that I like to study may seem

79
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.100
strange to some

80
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.000
Okay, I like ancient history by ancient history.

81
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.000
Let me be very clear what I mean. I like

82
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.200
ancient history 5,000 years ago to

83
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.200
about 300 BC,

84
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.000
right? So that's kind of a wide range

85
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.700
of ancient history. But then I also am a

86
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.300
history buff on World War Two history. Anybody

87
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.300
World War Two historians like to read on World War

88
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.600
Two.

89
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.100
Well, let me get that a little bit more specific. I like

90
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.300
to study The Life and Times of one

91
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.900
of World War two's major leaders, Winston

92
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.900
Churchill.

93
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.300
The British Bulldog, right, you know Winston Churchill

94
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.800
chomping on a cigar.

95
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.500
He was quite a character.

96
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.600
He would spend.

97
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.600
He would spend a lot of the morning.

98
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.900
in bed

99
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.100
with you know various things including the cigar

100
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.200
and he would dictate all these

101
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.900
memos.

102
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.900
But he was so eccentric but also so beloved.

103
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.800
And one of the things that we know about Winston Churchill

104
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.500
is in the time of his prime ministership.

105
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.800
One of the things that he did is he would

106
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.300
make regular calls, especially in the early days when

107
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.400
Britain was engaged in war with

108
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.500
Germany, he would make regular calls.

109
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.100
to our US President Roosevelt

110
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.300
and he would call and he would call and for a long

111
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.900
time. It was a different political world back

112
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.700
then in American politics America really

113
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.500
didn't want to get involved in the for in the second

114
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.400
world war. They didn't want to get involved at all and so Churchill using

115
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.400
all of his rhetorical skill would try

116
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.700
to convince Roosevelt and America that it

117
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.400
was in their interest to get involved in the war and he

118
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.700
would call.

119
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.400
from the cabinet War rooms

120
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.100
in London

121
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.000
He would call.

122
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.600
And he would call.

123
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.500
And he would call.

124
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.600
And Roosevelt was kind and would say all the

125
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.500
right things like we're with you buddy. He didn't say

126
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.800
buddy.

127
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.200
We're with you Mr. Churchill and very politicians speak. He

128
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.500
would say, you know all of our heart.

129
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.100
Is for the British people right and all those things?

130
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.900
But there was a turning point.

131
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.800
In the Turning Point happened after the attack on

132
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.400
Pearl Harbor.

133
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.400
when

134
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.800
Churchill made a call

135
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.700
and he said, you know, Mr. Roosevelt.

136
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.100
I'm so sorry to hear about the terrible attack.

137
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.800
and at that point

138
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.600
all of the calls that had gone before

139
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.900
that were ineffective.

140
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.300
That call was a call that saved why once

141
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.800
America got into the world war and you

142
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.000
can see this in Churchill's writings. Here's the reality.

143
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.800
He knew once America got into the

144
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.600
world war.

145
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.600
Essentially the Allied Forces would be victorious.

146
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.700
And sure enough they were that call.

147
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.700
After Pearl Harbor was a call that saved

148
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.500
why America was the great sleeping

149
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:11.900
giant.

150
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.700
reticent to get into war but once they got into war

151
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.900
it was the endgame.

152
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.300
I want to talk about a call that saves.

153
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.900
And I'm not talking about a call that saves in a World War.

154
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.200
I'm going to talk about a call that saves in the war for your soul

155
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.300
and for mine.

156
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.100
And Joel opens us up.

157
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.600
to the call

158
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.000
that saves

159
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.100
So if you have your Bible turn to Joel chapter 2.

160
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.800
We're going to begin in verse 28 and go all

161
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.500
the way to the end of the chapter 2 verse 32.

162
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.600
So the text reads this.

163
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.200
after this

164
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.300
I will pour out my spirit on all Humanity.

165
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.200
Then your sons and your daughters will prophesy your

166
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.100
old men will have dreams in your

167
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.400
young men will see visions.

168
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.100
I will even pour out my spirit on male and female

169
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.600
slaves in those days.

170
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.800
I will display wonders in the heavens and on the Earth.

171
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.800
Blood Fire Columns of smoke the sun will be

172
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.100
turned to Darkness and the moon to blood before the

173
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.300
great and terrible day of the Lord

174
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.400
comes, press pause.

175
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.900
Once again, we have this emphasis in the Book of Joel about

176
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.000
the the day of the Lord and as I've said the day of

177
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.300
the Lord.

178
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.800
Is an event where God reveals himself?

179
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.800
in judgment and/or salvation for Israel

180
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.800
and/or the nations in accordance with the justice and

181
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.200
the mercy of God, so we're talking about

182
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.600
Here a big time day of the

183
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.100
Lord where God reveals himself.

184
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.200
In both judgment and salvation for who?

185
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.600
Well, we'll talk about that.

186
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:07.700
Okay.

187
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.500
But this day of the Lord.

188
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.000
Is kind of like what we saw in chapter one The Day of the Lord

189
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.100
comes with Cosmic events.

190
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.100
here

191
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.400
we have Cosmic upheaval.

192
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.200
Right the sun's darkened.

193
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.400
the Moon

194
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.000
blood red

195
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.200
it looks like everything is topsy turvy. So

196
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.000
there's Cosmic phenomena with the day of the Lord verse

197
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.800
32 then everyone who

198
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.200
calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

199
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.500
For there will be in.

200
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.100
For there will be an escape for those on Mount

201
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.700
Zion and in Jerusalem as the Lord promised amongst

202
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.600
the survivors that the Lord calls.

203
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.000
This passage helps us understand a call

204
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.400
that saves now. I just want to offer two Reflections from

205
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.500
this passage and then bring it home to us. Okay?

206
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.900
So what I'd like for you to do is hang on with me first reflection that

207
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.300
we see from this passage of scripture is quite simply this and

208
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.600
it may not seem immediately obvious, but I want you

209
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.700
to walk through this with me.

210
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.900
First thing we see in this passage listen to me is God

211
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.700
wants us to experience

212
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.900
him.

213
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.000
God wants us to experience him.

214
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.000
Now how many of you live by a calendar?

215
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.800
Anybody let me see some hands anybody live by calendar.

216
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.200
I do.

217
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.600
In fact, I've got mine pulled up right here.

218
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.400
my calendar

219
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.500
is full from about 6:30 until about

220
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.300
8:30

221
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.900
because it's a heavy time right now.

222
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.200
Not 6:30 in the morning to 8:30 in the morning. That would be a good day.

223
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.700
Right. These are long days. My days are filled according

224
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.900
to a calendar.

225
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.700
I have a lot of events on the that calendar.

226
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.600
And sometimes if you live by a calendar and students you're

227
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.400
about to go to college or you're about to go into the workforce. You'll

228
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.900
find out very quickly. It's a little bit different than High

229
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.100
School.

230
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.100
You're living according to a calendar that's really imposed on

231
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.600
you in a way that's never been imposed before.

232
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.500
And so you have you know, Monday Wednesday Friday classes at this

233
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.000
time this time and this time you get Tuesday Thursday classes.

234
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.500
You might not have night classes.

235
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.800
Some of you are working you have a work schedule that you've got to live

236
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.100
by.

237
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.400
And sometimes when we live according to our calendars we move from

238
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
events.

239
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.100
to events

240
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.000
to events to events and we're grinding down

241
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.900
into powder.

242
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.400
events

243
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.400
I'm tired of events.

244
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.400
I don't like events.

245
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.600
In fact, I was telling our our Student Government leadership early

246
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.400
last year.

247
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.000
I said, you know, we've got a lot of events going on at

248
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.400
OBU. I'm tired of events.

249
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.500
Aren't you tired of events?

250
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.000
Just going from thing to thing.

251
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.100
my goodness events

252
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.700
What we need to move from is from events to

253
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.900
experiences why because an

254
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.200
event doesn't change your life.

255
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.800
Events beat us down but an experience.

256
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.600
Well an experience can change your life.

257
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.100
I remember the first time I went trout fishing with my dad.

258
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.300
You know I had been fishing before.

259
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.000
Lake Ray Hubbard and all sorts

260
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.400
of lakes and Dallas Fort Worth area

261
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.300
It was fine. I got some bubble gum out of it was good. Yeah,

262
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.700
I Like It Outdoors. Yay.

263
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.400
But when I went trout fishing for the first time in the Smoky Mountains

264
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.300
Hiking through the mountains climbing on rocks seeing copperhead

265
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.100
snakes.

266
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.500
Not getting bit by them.

267
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I remember the first time, you know, I was I was fishing and I

268
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.900
saw a black bear. First of all, that's scary.

269
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.500
But you know how I know it wasn't just an event on the

270
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.600
calendar of my young life. I still try out fish today.

271
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.900
In fact in a little while. I have planned and God

272
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.000
willing I'll be able to do it.

273
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.100
Take my boys.

274
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.400
After the semester to go trout fishing and they love

275
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.000
to do it, too. We're gonna go back to the Smokies.

276
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.700
So an experience changes your life.

277
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.300
Now listen to me.

278
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.200
What God desires for you and me is not an event

279
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.200
on the calendar.

280
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.700
God wants for you and me to experience.

281
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.500
him

282
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.600
you say what?

283
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.500
How do you know?

284
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.300
Because the Bible tells me so.

285
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:24.800
Check this out.

286
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.000
in Joel 2:28 to 32

287
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.900
God points to the fact that he doesn't want

288
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.300
us to just have an a time

289
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.500
like a worship service or something like that where we

290
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.300
kind of experience something and sing some songs. No,

291
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.900
he wants us to encounter and experience

292
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.600
him. So our lives are fundamentally changed.

293
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.400
Why because did you notice?

294
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.600
In verse 28 what happens look at this?

295
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.900
What does it say after this? I will pour out

296
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.800
my spirit.

297
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.900
And when the spirit comes God's people who have

298
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.700
this Spirit encounter guess what's going to happen?

299
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.100
They are going to prophesy.

300
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.400
the spirit

301
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.200
is the empowering presence that God

302
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.600
gives to his people so that they may know him

303
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.800
when we look at Joel 2:28 to

304
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.300
29. We see that this text has some

305
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.400
kind of connection using similar

306
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.200
language to other prophetic texts.

307
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.600
Like in Isaiah and Ezekiel, here's the difference between

308
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.500
Isaiah's use of the spirit

309
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.800
and ezekiel's use of the spirit.

310
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.000
In Joel what we've got here was when the spirit comes God's

311
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.300
people are gifted to prophesy.

312
00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.200
prophesy

313
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.400
So like in Isaiah, this is interesting.

314
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.000
In Isaiah when the spirit comes God's people are enabled to

315
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.900
you know, follow his commands and follow his words

316
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.700
Divine instruction. This is Isaiah 59:21 in

317
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.400
Ezekiel 36 God's spirit is poured out.

318
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.500
So that God's people can follow God's judgments and statutes.

319
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.600
in Ezekiel 37 when the spirit comes

320
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.900
God gives life to his people but in Joel.

321
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.400
When the spirit is poured out.

322
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.400
God's people actually speak God's word like Prophets

323
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.000
The Spirit in Joel 228-29 enables God's

324
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.700
people to do the work of Prophecy. And what does

325
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.300
that actually mean? What does it mean when you see like Joel

326
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.800
and these other prophets prophesy?

327
00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.200
Deborah there's a lot of prophets and prophetesses in

328
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.700
the Old Testament.

329
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.700
It means that God enables his people to

330
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.500
experience him listen to this.

331
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.100
Personally, you know who's the consummate prophet in the Old Testament Moses? And

332
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.700
you know what the Bible says about Moses?

333
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.600
Moses saw God face

334
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.500
to face Abraham's called the prophet

335
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.800
You know what Abraham experienced. Well the Book

336
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.700
of James tells us.

337
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.400
That Abraham was a friend of God.

338
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.300
Who's your best friend?

339
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.300
Who's your closest friend?

340
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.500
What do you do with your friend when you get into a tough time? What do you

341
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.100
do you call them?

342
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.100
Who's your closest friend you laugh together you cry together you do

343
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.500
stuff together. You have a lot of fun together.

344
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.600
You can fight in one another Abraham the consummate prophet

345
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.300
in the Old Testament with Moses is called a

346
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.800
friend of God.

347
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.100
No, God personally.

348
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.300
experience him personally

349
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.000
to hear his voice like a friend.

350
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.200
And then speak God's word to those who need to hear it. That's what prophets do.

351
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.800
So when you think about Experiencing God, it's not just having

352
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.300
an emotional experience.

353
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:16.900
It's

354
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.300
Hearing God's word.

355
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.700
Like a friend as he gives you guidance.

356
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.800
and direction in life

357
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.100
as he reveals truth.

358
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.700
So that then you can live it but also Proclaim it.

359
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.300
So this outpouring of the spirit described in

360
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.300
Joel is powerful.

361
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.600
Because it's personal.

362
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.400
It's experiential.

363
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.400
It's intimate.

364
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:48.700
It's real.

365
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.100
And then God empowers us to speak his word to those who need

366
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.600
to hear it.

367
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.800
And this is an interesting reality in

368
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.000
the Book of Joel now in the Book of Joel you'll notice that it's God's

369
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.800
Representatives who speak God's word in

370
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.900
chapter one. We saw this. Do you remember this in chapter

371
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.100
one when God's people cry out? It's the priests.

372
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.300
Who go before the people?

373
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.000
And they lead the people in crying out to God. So the priests

374
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.700
are the one Speaking the word of

375
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.700
God. Did you see that impedance? They're going to

376
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.000
the temple and they're saying on behalf of the people and Leading the People.

377
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.300
Hey God, this is what's going on the priests.

378
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.000
They repent of the temple with the priests the people do at the

379
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.300
with the priests at the lead. They repented the

380
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.000
temple and the the priests are at the front of

381
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:45.900
the procession

382
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:47.900
but check this out.

383
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.900
That form of worship is hierarchical. Did you

384
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.200
see that?

385
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.000
The priests are at the head.

386
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.500
The priests are doing all the talking.

387
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.600
What's interesting here?

388
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.100
Is when the spirit of God is poured out.

389
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.800
This is a huge contrast to what we've seen before.

390
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.800
When God's spirit comes upon all people here in

391
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.600
Joel 2:28 to 32. There's no hierarchy.

392
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.500
All people are imbued with the spirit of God in the gift of

393
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.000
Prophecy and vision from the Lord this picture. Let me

394
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.400
just say Accords with the New Testament image of God's

395
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.200
people becoming the spiritual house.

396
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.600
the temple

397
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.800
what is the text say after this? I will pour out my

398
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.400
spirit on who the rich? No, that's

399
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.100
not what it says.

400
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.900
I know the good looking. No, that's not what it

401
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.300
says. Oh, I know the priests and the most holy

402
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.500
people that's not what it says.

403
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.100
It says that I will pour out this is God speaking my spirit

404
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.200
on all Humanities some of your versions

405
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.700
say All Flesh.

406
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.600
And when he does this your sons and your daughters, I know

407
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.700
who will up speak God's word and receives a spirit.

408
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.100
I know it's only going to be you know, the spiritually mature and

409
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.000
not the Young. No.

410
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.500
Young

411
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.600
here your sons and your daughters will prophesy your old

412
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.700
men will have dreams your young men will see visions.

413
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.200
Seeing visions having dreams speaking words of God.

414
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.000
That is the function definition of prophecy.

415
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.300
And intimate relationship with God wherein he encounters

416
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.100
you and you experience him and then all the

417
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.600
sudden you're for claiming God's word. You're gaining Insight

418
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.800
you didn't have before this is the outpouring of the spirit.

419
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.900
This is a renewal.

420
00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.800
I even like this idea that

421
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.700
It's unbelievable. And it's hard sometimes when we read

422
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.800
verse 29. I will pour out my spirit on the male and

423
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.100
female slaves in those days.

424
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.900
You might say well, I don't like that slavery in the bible stuff, right?

425
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.400
Read the book of fleeman, you'll see there's a progression out of it. You know,

426
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400
that's the way that works.

427
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.700
But you know, there's something about this male and female slaves.

428
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.000
These could be indentured servants of who

429
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.200
are fellow Israelites, but it also could be

430
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.000
captured slaves who were non-israelites

431
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.400
in the midst of Israel, and if that's the case then non-israelites you

432
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.900
Call these Gentiles.

433
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.100
in the New Testament

434
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.300
not Israelites also received the

435
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.200
gift of Prophecy.

436
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.400
the experience with God

437
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Israelites non Israelites Jews gentiles

438
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.200
God wants all to experience

439
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.300
him.

440
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:02.600
now

441
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.900
If that's true.

442
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.400
my friends

443
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.200
it points to this fact that God doesn't just want some

444
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.100
to know and experience him.

445
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.600
He wants all to come and know to

446
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.500
experience him.

447
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.500
The spirit reveals the truth that God wants us to experience

448
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.400
him intimately.

449
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.000
personally

450
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.300
like prophets we hear God's voice speak God's word. This is

451
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.900
God's desire. Not just for a few. It's for

452
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.000
you and for me least to the greatest young old able-bodied

453
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.900
and those with disabilities different backgrounds

454
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.900
different social classes different ethnicities. God

455
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.800
wants to pour out his Spirit on all Humanity.

456
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.500
Sometimes we think that God really wants to

457
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.700
know some of us the good the perfect.

458
00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.500
the nice

459
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.400
only those who go to church

460
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.600
Joel too reminds us that God because he

461
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.000
loves us.

462
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.000
wants to pour out his Spirit on all

463
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.300
some of us might think well God doesn't really need me. He just wants to

464
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.500
bless the needy the poor.

465
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.900
Those in need maybe another lands.

466
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.900
But that's not pictures that we get here.

467
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.300
God wants you to experience him. God

468
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.200
wants me to experience him

469
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.000
because of the radical love of

470
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.200
God this phrase. God will pour

471
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.700
out his Spirit on All Flesh all Humanity

472
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.900
upon male and female sleep slaves indicates

473
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.700
that God is no respecter of persons.

474
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.600
He loves.

475
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.100
And he wants to pour out his spirit and what is the spirit? Why the

476
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.300
spirit?

477
00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.800
The spirit empowers us to hear God's voice.

478
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.400
to know God

479
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.100
to discern truth from error

480
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.700
And to speak God's word with power. See God wants.

481
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.300
All to experience him.

482
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.300
I think about this.

483
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.800
radical transformation that comes from Experiencing God

484
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.500
and I think about one of our students.

485
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.300
Who experienced God in a special way?

486
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.500
This this past semester.

487
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.500
She grew up in church.

488
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.600
And she was actually one of our volleyball players unbelievable athlete

489
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.600
very tall.

490
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.600
And she's also an artist singer.

491
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:50.800
unbelievable

492
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.500
But like many of us, you know, she might have grown up in church,

493
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.600
and she was just kind of wandering around going from this

494
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.300
relationship to that relationship.

495
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.500
God was kind of a feature in her life, but not really personal.

496
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.100
experiential

497
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.200
and what happens?

498
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.200
in a Revival

499
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.800
You know a couple of weeks after the Asbury Revival.

500
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.000
When God began to move on our campus and we saw

501
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.400
lives changed and we saw worship

502
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.600
Unleashed and we saw the Lord getting

503
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.400
hold of people and they were responding students

504
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.900
were responding and we had worship services that lasted hours

505
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.600
and hours in the in the

506
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.500
the hours of the class and hours of the

507
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.700
day, but also deep into the night.

508
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.300
This student told her mother and she was a little bit skeptical on

509
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.000
church because of some of the pain and some

510
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.700
of the things that she had experienced.

511
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.600
As she kind of rebelled against the Lord.

512
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.100
just skeptical

513
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.400
But she told her mother. I don't know what's going on at OBU,

514
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.400
but something's happening to me.

515
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.100
God's getting hold of me.

516
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.100
And what happened? I don't know how else to explain it.

517
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.400
She experienced God.

518
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.800
And her life was changed.

519
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.500
Few days after the Revival she gave

520
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.800
a testimony in Chapel.

521
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.900
And she said those of you who knew me before?

522
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.800
If you told me that I would be speaking in Chapel

523
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.000
about what God's done in my life. Nobody would have believed it. I wouldn't believed

524
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.200
it.

525
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.600
But this is her testimony.

526
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.200
I don't know how to tell you this.

527
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.500
But I am transformed.

528
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.500
How does that happen?

529
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.600
when we experience God

530
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.400
when we hear the call of God on our life.

531
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.600
And my friends when we give our heart and Life to Jesus Christ.

532
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.100
He gives us his spirit.

533
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.800
We hear his voice.

534
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.500
like a friend

535
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.100
in our lives

536
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.400
are

537
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:23.900
changed

538
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800
our tongues

539
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.600
are loosed.

540
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.600
our eyes

541
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.700
are opened

542
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.900
our heart

543
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.300
is warmed

544
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.400
and we speak the word of God from the

545
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.700
heart.

546
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.700
So let me ask you a basic question this morning students.

547
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.300
From this end of the room all the way back there.

548
00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.200
Have you experienced God?

549
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.200
He said well, I mean I think so. I don't know.

550
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.000
Well, I have good news for you because this leads us to our second reflection.

551
00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.400
How do you experience God?

552
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.100
This gets us to the call that saves.

553
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.600
After this outpouring of the spirit this point about

554
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.500
God's spirit being poured out.

555
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.700
We find out how that happens look at it.

556
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.000
Then everyone who calls on the name of the

557
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.300
Lord will be saved for there will be an escape

558
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.500
for those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem

559
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.800
as the Lord promised amongst the survivors the Lord calls

560
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.000
you see when the day of the Lord comes and that's

561
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.700
what it's talking about.

562
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.200
where God comes to judge the living and the

563
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.500
dead

564
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.700
who's going to survive?

565
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.000
Those who call on God's name.

566
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.500
When we call on the name of the Lord, we are asking

567
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.600
God for help Deliverance instead of

568
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.500
other sources. We think will help.

569
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.700
God's very name call on the name of the

570
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.300
Lord God's very name ensures deliverance and

571
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.500
help because that's who God is

572
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.400
He is the deliverer. He is the savior. He is

573
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.800
the Lord.

574
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.400
And no other name can save.

575
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.800
only his name can save

576
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.500
how do we call or who do we call in times of

577
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:33.800
trouble?

578
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.500
I tend to call my dad.

579
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.400
My dad's one of my heroes.

580
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400
In times of trouble. I called my dad that's good.

581
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.100
I have some friends that I call in times of trouble. I have a mentor that

582
00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.500
I call in times of trouble.

583
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.100
And what I call their names that I say Dad I need help Jay. I

584
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.500
need help.

585
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.600
Matt I need help.

586
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.100
Guess what happens I get good advice. I get somebody to pray

587
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.400
for me.

588
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.300
But my father my family my mentor and my

589
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.200
friend can't save me.

590
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.700
There's only one day.

591
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.700
That can save there's only one name that can hold life.

592
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.300
and death

593
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.100
there's only one name that can preserve my life

594
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.900
now.

595
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.200
but also for eternity

596
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.200
the very name of God.

597
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.400
Who is the name of the day? What is the name of the Lord? Who is this person

598
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.400
that I'm talking about?

599
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.100
Well in the book of Acts those who call

600
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.300
on the name of the Lord for salvation.

601
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.500
Call on the name of Jesus.

602
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.700
Believing his salvation. We know this because

603
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.500
you know when?

604
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.500
In the book of Acts after Jesus is ascended one of

605
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.600
Jesus's followers a rough guy named Peter.

606
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.100
He starts preaching there at the temple and all the sudden this weird Spirit

607
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.300
thing happens where tongues of

608
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.400
fire appear and everybody's talking and there's all these

609
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.800
different nations and tribes and languages speaking, but because

610
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.700
of these tongues of fire somehow everybody's able to

611
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.100
hear the word of the lord. It's an unbelievable outpouring of

612
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.200
prophecy and

613
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:23.900
In that moment.

614
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.900
Some of the people who are a little skeptical say everybody's drunk what's

615
00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.000
going on?

616
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.200
muttering around what's going on Peter jumps in

617
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.200
verse 14 of chapter 2 and he says

618
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.400
fellow Jews and all you read it residents of Jerusalem. Let me

619
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.900
explain this to you and pay attention to my words for these

620
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.800
people aren't drunk as you suppose. It's only nine

621
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.700
in the morning if they're drunk at 9:00 in the morning. They've got a

622
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.500
problem, right?

623
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.800
On the contrary. This is what was spoken through the prophet Joel.

624
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.200
And then he quotes our passage he says and it will

625
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.400
be in these last days says God that I will pour out my spirit on

626
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.900
all people then your sons and your daughters will prophesy your

627
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.100
young men will see Visions. Your old men will dream dreams. I will

628
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.400
even pour out my spirit on my servants in those days but men and

629
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.200
women and they will prophesy and I will display wonders in the heaven above signs

630
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.300
on the earth below blood and fire and smoke the

631
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.800
sun will be turned to Darkness and the moon to blood before the

632
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:27.600
great and glorious day of the Lord comes then everyone who calls

633
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.300
on the name of the

634
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.900
Lord will be saved fellow Israelites. Listen to these words. This

635
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.900
Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to

636
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.900
you by God with Miracles Wonder signs. And

637
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.800
God did among you through him just as yourself no.

638
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.500
Though he was delivered up. According to God's judgment. Did God's

639
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.900
determine play and in foreknowledge. You used Lawless

640
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.700
people to nail him to the cross and kill him. God raised them

641
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:53.900
up.

642
00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.300
Ending the Pains of death because it was not possible for him

643
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.800
to be held by Death.

644
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.800
And then this is what he says.

645
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.500
After he talks about Jesus and what Jesus did he?

646
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.700
Says you need to call on Jesus's name for salvation.

647
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.900
There's only one name that is able to ultimately save

648
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.200
you.

649
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.600
And it's not the name of a university.

650
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.000
It's not the name of a profession or a job. It's not the name of a friend

651
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.300
or a family member. There's only one name that will be your

652
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.300
and look at what Joel says escape from

653
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.700
judgment.

654
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.900
And that's the name.

655
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.200
of Jesus

656
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.800
the name of Jesus

657
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.600
the name of Jesus

658
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.800
and we are in the time right now where we have

659
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.200
the opportunity to call on the name of Jesus. And

660
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.700
when we do guess what happens the spirit comes and

661
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.600
we experience God and it's not just for

662
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.000
the religious view. It's not just for me who's preaching this

663
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.100
morning. It's for you.

664
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.600
So you can know God.

665
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.100
Like a friend there's only one name that saves.

666
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.000
We can call.

667
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.100
on Jesus's name

668
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.100
Do you know him?

669
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.100
Have you called on the name that saves?

670
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.100
It's the name of Jesus.

671
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.900
When we do my friends we can have the experience of

672
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.800
one of our students.

673
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.800
life transformation

674
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.700
Light behind the eyes rather than when you wake up, it's just

675
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.900
the the worst.

676
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.000
Doldrum. Oh another day. It doesn't have to be that way.

677
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.300
You can break addictions.

678
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.100
You can find purpose and meaning.

679
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.600
you can find forgiveness of sins if

680
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.300
You call in his name?
