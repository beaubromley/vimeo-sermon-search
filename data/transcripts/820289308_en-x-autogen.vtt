1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:13.500
here you

2
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.100
well, good morning.

3
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.500
That was all right.

4
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.200
I've got to tell you how pleased I am to be

5
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.100
with you and

6
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.100
the leadership here reached out

7
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.300
on Thursday. I think it was my days have

8
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.600
kind of gotten confused.

9
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.200
I think it was Thursday and they said Hey

10
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.300
in light of the tornado if you can't make it,

11
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.200
that's fine. We understand we got you covered.

12
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.800
And the more I thought about it.

13
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.400
The more I said, no, I need to be with Henderson.

14
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.900
number one

15
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.400
Jill and my family and I we've gotten to love

16
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.700
you and the congregation and pastor and

17
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.500
the elders we've come

18
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.900
to love you.

19
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.800
secondly, just the thought of

20
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.700
the normal sea of preaching God's word

21
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.000
Resonated with me and so what I'm

22
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.300
going to do is speak from

23
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.600
my heart about what God has revealed

24
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.400
in his word.

25
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.100
The Book of Joel I'm also going to talk kind of

26
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.800
personally

27
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.000
about something that we've been experiencing in

28
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
the past 72 hours or so.

29
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
That can only be described as a

30
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.700
miracle of God and then how we should respond to that.

31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.100
So let me talk to you a little bit about the Book of

32
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.200
Joel, you know, there are books in the Bible that you kind of

33
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.300
feel like are barely in the Bible.

34
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.600
And for most of us, that's a lot of the Old Testament

35
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300
now as an Old Testament professor.

36
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.500
I love all the books in the Bible even those that

37
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.800
seem barely there like Joel or

38
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.900
Obadiah. Yes. There is an Obadiah all

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.100
21 verses of it.

40
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.300
Or Nahum actually most of

41
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.300
the Minor Prophets. They're called Minor Prophets

42
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.000
so surely they can't be that important, right?

43
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.800
minor

44
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.800
Well Minor Prophets don't mean anything like

45
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.700
they're kind of relatively unimportant minor

46
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.100
just simply has to do with the size of the book.

47
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.100
But these are Minor Prophets with major themes.

48
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.100
And so these realities that God exposes

49
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.500
from these books listen to

50
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.600
me.

51
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.800
whether you're 10

52
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.700
or a hundred

53
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.800
God wants to speak to you.

54
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.500
God wants to engage you and me and so

55
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.800
the Book of Joel is one voice

56
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.800
in a chorus of 12 voices called

57
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.700
the Minor Prophets and

58
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.800
the Book of Joel is kind of like a key because all

59
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.300
of the themes all of the

60
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.400
theological realities all of the words that God has

61
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.200
given in the Minor Prophets find kind of

62
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.400
their nextest point in the teaching of the Book of Joel. So

63
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
if you understand Joel

64
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.700
You can kind of understand the rest of the Minor Prophets.

65
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.700
So what we want to do over the next few weeks is walk

66
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.300
through Joel now. There's some

67
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.300
weird stuff in there. I'm not gonna lie to you. I mean the title of

68
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.700
today's message is lessons from

69
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.800
a locust.

70
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.600
You might be thinking. What are we gonna talk about bugs all

71
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.800
week? Well, we're gonna yeah, we're gonna talk about bugs.

72
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.400
Yeah, we are.

73
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.400
We're going to talk about locusts.

74
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.600
And we're going to do that because Joel talks about locusts.

75
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.400
And you might be thinking well, what's a locust? Is that a grasshopper or

76
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.100
is that a cicada?

77
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.400
I don't know. I I don't know I actually do know but

78
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.600
you'll learn with me what it is.

79
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.200
It's custom weird things in there. But here's what I have confidence in.

80
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.100
If you hang with me.

81
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.600
If you walk with me through the word

82
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.100
of God.

83
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.500
And if you unclog your ears to hear

84
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.300
God's voice.

85
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.800
And here's the great miracle this morning.

86
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.400
God wants to speak to you.

87
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.000
Doesn't matter what you did last night.

88
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.100
Doesn't matter how far from God you are in this

89
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.400
room.

90
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.500
It doesn't matter how close you perceive that you are to God

91
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.300
right now in this room. Listen to me my friends.

92
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.900
God wants to speak.

93
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.700
to you

94
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.300
So if we unclog our ears.

95
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.900
Be attentive to God's voice.

96
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.600
He'll speak.

97
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.100
So I'm going to ask you to follow along with me as I

98
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.200
open God's word.

99
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.500
We're gonna unpack the first chapter of Joel. So

100
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.700
just

101
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.600
Hang with me we're going to read 20 or so verses.

102
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.600
And follow along. I'm reading from the ESV.

103
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.000
On the word of the Lord that came to Joel.

104
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.800
Anybody in this room named pethuel?

105
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.500
Didn't think so.

106
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.900
Verse two here this you Elders give ear all inhabitants

107
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.800
of the land has such a thing.

108
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.100
Happened in your days or in the days of your forefathers.

109
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.600
Tell your children of it let your children tell their

110
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.500
children and their children to another generation and here

111
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.800
we get to verse 4 about the bugs.

112
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.200
What the cutting Locust is left the swarming Locust is

113
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.600
eaten what the swarming Locust has left. The hopping Locust

114
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.600
is eaten, but the hopping Locust is left the destroying

115
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.000
locusts has eaten that's a lot

116
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.200
of different kind of locusts.

117
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.900
awake

118
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.300
you drunkards and weep and wail all you

119
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.500
drinkers of wine because of the sweet wine for it's

120
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.200
cut off from your mouth.

121
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.800
For a nation has come up against my land powerful

122
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.300
Beyond number its teeth or lion's teeth

123
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.200
and it has the fangs of a lioness. It is

124
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.000
laid waste by Vine and splintered my fig tree.

125
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.400
It is stripped off their bark and thrown it down their branches are

126
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.100
made white.

127
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.800
Verse 8 lament Like a Virgin wearing sackcloth

128
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.400
for the bridegroom of her youth the grain offering and

129
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.100
the drink offering are cut off from the house of the Lord the priests

130
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.500
mourn the Ministers of the Lord. The

131
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.500
fields are destroyed the ground Mourns because the grain

132
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.100
is destroyed the wine dries up and the oil languishes.

133
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.200
Be ashamed of tillers of the soil. Well, oh

134
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.700
Vine dressers for the wheat and The Barley

135
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.700
because the Harvest of the field has perished.

136
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.500
Isn't this just a happy book?

137
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.600
I mean you think wow, I feel really encouraged.

138
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.200
Especially after tornado. This is probably not the best

139
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.800
book to read.

140
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.800
The vine dries up. The Fig Tree language is pomegranate palm

141
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.200
and apple all the trees of the field are dried up

142
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.400
and gladness dries up from the children of man

143
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.000
put on.

144
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.600
Sackcloth and lament o priests whale o

145
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.200
Ministers of the altar go in past the night

146
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.000
and sackcloth the Ministers of my God because drain offering

147
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.100
and drink offering are withheld from the house of your

148
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.400
God consecrate a fast.

149
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.500
Call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all

150
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.100
the inhabitants of the land to the house of the

151
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.500
Lord your God and you need to underline this phrase

152
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.600
cry out.

153
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.500
to the Lord and then verse 15

154
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.700
introduces a reality called

155
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.300
the day of the Lord and I'm

156
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.200
going to unpack that in just a minute, but

157
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.400
The day of the Lord is a concept in a

158
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.300
reality that actually friends you and I need to understand.

159
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.900
Because it sets a pattern.

160
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.700
For what we see in the ministry of

161
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.200
Jesus you say what? Yes

162
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.500
If you can understand the day of the Lord, you can understand what Jesus is

163
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.000
doing at the cross and the resurrection.

164
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.000
The less you understand of the day of

165
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.600
the Lord the less you'll understand the cross and Resurrection.

166
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.800
So the day of the Lord is really really important. In

167
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.500
fact, the day of the Lord is considered by some to be

168
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.200
the central idea in the minor the prophets

169
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.200
and here we get a picture of the day of the Lord.

170
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.700
You ready?

171
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.300
Last it comes there's an interesting word play in the Hebrew. The

172
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.500
almighty here is El Shaddai.

173
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.900
The word for Destruction there is should.

174
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.300
So should I should it's a

175
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.200
word play that that Joel is using here. That's a

176
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200
little poetry for you.

177
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.400
Verse 16 is not the food cut off before our eyes

178
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.500
joy and gladness from the house of our God the seeds.

179
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.800
Shrivel under the clods. The storehouses are desolate. The

180
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.200
granaries are torn down because the grain is

181
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.700
dried up how I love this. This is so interesting.

182
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.200
how the beasts grown

183
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.800
the herds of cattle are perplexed because

184
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.100
there's no pasture for them.

185
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.100
Even the flocks of sheep. Suffer To

186
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.900
You O Lord I call.

187
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.400
For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

188
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.500
And Flame has burned all the trees of the field even the

189
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.400
beasts of the field can't for

190
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.500
you.

191
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.400
Because the water Brooks are dried up

192
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.100
and the fire has devoured pastures the wilderness.

193
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.100
From this passage chapter 1 we're going

194
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.300
to take some lessons.

195
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.100
And these lessons begin and end with

196
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.900
a locust.

197
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.900
Now what you need to understand about this passage of scripture is

198
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.900
Joel chapter 1 is really about

199
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.200
destruction. In fact, the Book of

200
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.900
Joel can be divided up into two halves destruction or

201
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.600
judgment and restoration or

202
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.300
salvation. That's the Book of Joel in a nutshell.

203
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.400
So for the first

204
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.200
Few weeks. We're going to be talking about judgment and destruction. You said

205
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.300
that's kind of a downer. I don't like talking about that. I didn't write

206
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.100
the book. I don't mean what do you want me to do?

207
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.400
So we got to go with what God is giving us.

208
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.300
Thing that I want us to look at in the first lesson.

209
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.000
is this

210
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.100
Okay lesson number one.

211
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.500
We find In this passage is God's word is

212
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.300
true and reliable. There are a

213
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.900
lot of things that we can lean on in our lives.

214
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.400
I mean in the west especially.

215
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.100
We have jobs.

216
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.800
We've got communities.

217
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.600
We've got friends and family.

218
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.300
If I can be blunt, we've got money.

219
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.800
There are a lot of things we can lean on.

220
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.600
But there's one thing that we need to lean on.

221
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:50.600
most

222
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:52.600
God

223
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.500
and his word

224
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.000
and students if I can grab your

225
00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.000
attention for just a minute.

226
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.900
And making appeal to you.

227
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.000
Please hear me when I say.

228
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.800
The lord loves you.

229
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.100
He gives you his word because he loves you.

230
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.100
And that word is good.

231
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.400
It is true.

232
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.800
And it's reliable you can build your life on it.

233
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.400
Now the reason I say this is because when we

234
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.700
look at the lesson from the Locust the Locust reminds God's

235
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.300
people that his word is true.

236
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.500
And it can be relied upon God's word

237
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.000
is true. We can take God's word to the bank. It's reliable

238
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.300
we can build our lives on it

239
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.800
God's word is secure.

240
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.600
How do we know this from a humble little

241
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.600
Locust I want you to look at verse 4 again. Look

242
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.200
at verse 4.

243
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.200
Verse 4 is a strange little verse isn't

244
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.300
it? There's a lot of bugs there cutting locusts has

245
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.500
left the swarming Locust has eaten swarming Locust

246
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.500
is left. The hopping Locust is eaten hopping Locust

247
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.300
is left the destroying Locust has eaten. There are

248
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.800
a lot of different Locust described there. Now people like

249
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.600
me, you know go to nerd conventions and

250
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.800
we talk about these things. Oh, yes. This is a finest blah

251
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.500
blah blah. No.

252
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.600
As probably not what is going on here.

253
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.700
In fact, this is describing in you

254
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.300
know, interesting detail the

255
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.600
idea of an ancient near Eastern Locust plague.

256
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.700
And what you got to understand is in the ancient world particularly in

257
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.400
the land of Israel. They would have these giant Locust

258
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.600
swarms they still do today.

259
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.000
these Locust swarms grasshoppers

260
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.100
that come they multiply Waters come rains come

261
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.200
and in certain seasons of the year and all the sudden all

262
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.500
these locusts grow and then they swarm and

263
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.100
when I say swarm they cover everything.

264
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.500
And they eat.

265
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.400
Everything so if they hit a field the field is gone.

266
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.900
now in that world

267
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.200
Here's what you got to understand. It's not

268
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.800
like you can go to McDonald's and buy a hamburger and get some food. This

269
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.600
is an agrarian economy. What that means is it's

270
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.700
run and fueled by produce.

271
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.300
And farming and agriculture. Okay, and

272
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.500
if you have a natural disaster like

273
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.600
a locust plague.

274
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.200
You don't have any food more than that. You don't have any

275
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.600
kind of anything to trade.

276
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.400
It's an agrarian economy. So we're talking

277
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.400
about Locust play. You might just say oh man what an inconvenience

278
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.200
a bunch of bugs. No.

279
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.500
This is the life threatening plague.

280
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.200
And so when there's this conversation about a locust

281
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.400
plague that's coming immediately. You

282
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.700
think a threat to my livelihood a threat

283
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.600
to my life my children my family my

284
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.000
community. It's about to be wiped out the Locust plague.

285
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.700
Is significant but it teaches us a lesson.

286
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.600
The Locust plague reminds God's people of

287
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.100
something important. Now how many of you

288
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.100
have these devices?

289
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.400
Some of you are looking at them right now.

290
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.200
You know, how on an Instagram feed you you kind of

291
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.200
if you set it up if you look at your Instagram feed

292
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.400
and you you see a real you

293
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.500
can work on your story or something like that. What you

294
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.300
can do is you can set up a number of pictures or short

295
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.300
videos, you know.

296
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.400
This picture and then this picture in this picture and it just goes through a

297
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.900
timeline where all these pictures show up. You don't talk about.

298
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.300
What you need to understand is the Bible is kind

299
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:45.700
of like that.

300
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.400
It gives this picture and then this picture and then

301
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.100
this picture and it kind of just like

302
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:53.900
story

303
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.600
You as the reader are kind of given the

304
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.200
task of hey put all these things together. How does

305
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.600
this story all work this picture and this picture. How does all fit together?

306
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.600
That's what's going on. When the Locust plague shows

307
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.000
up. It's kind of like Memories.

308
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.400
aren't memories funny

309
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.400
when you smell something.

310
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.700
Memory might be a perfume.

311
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.200
Or a cologne you think oh that reminds me of

312
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.900
that or you walk into your grandmother's house.

313
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.500
You smell that food.

314
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.400
And you think all the good old days when I

315
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.000
didn't have any responsibility. I was just a kid.

316
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.300
right

317
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.000
or you walk into a school?

318
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.300
And you see something.

319
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.900
You think oh, do you remember when?

320
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.400
Or you go to a location and it brings back

321
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.800
good or bad?

322
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.100
Memories memories are funny.

323
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.500
Because something that you see smell hear

324
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.000
touch could be

325
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.100
a song you hear the song you think. Oh, man. I feel

326
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.500
like I'm being transported back.

327
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.000
To the 90s, you know.

328
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:12.900
Memories are funny.

329
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.200
Something that we see or hear triggers our

330
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.300
memory and it draws us back

331
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.200
to something that's happened in the past, you know.

332
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.300
The Bible and the Lord because

333
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.100
he made us he knows this and so one of the key ways that

334
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.300
the Bible communicates is through the activation and

335
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.200
the triggering of memory. How do I know this?

336
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.600
Do you know the Locust plague?

337
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.900
Is a memory trigger?

338
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.900
In fact, when you look at the Old Testament in particularly,

339
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.200
the Locust plague draws

340
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.300
God's people back to what God has

341
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.300
done in the past.

342
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.900
the Locust plague

343
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.300
the Locust plague now what you need to understand. There are a

344
00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.000
lot of ways to understand this Locust play. They could be a real

345
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.800
kind of natural disaster that could be an image

346
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.100
or a metaphor of an invading Nation.

347
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.700
It could be some sort of combination of the two. In fact

348
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.400
what you got going on in this passage the

349
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.600
Locust plague.

350
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.200
Is conjoining this idea of a natural

351
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.900
disaster and an invading Army?

352
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.000
And it's doing so for a purpose to say God's people

353
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.200
are under threat.

354
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.700
But because it's a locust plague it's drawing their

355
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.500
memory back to what God's been doing and saying

356
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.000
in the past through his word check this out.

357
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.700
It's 10.

358
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.900
indicates God's plagues against Egypt

359
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.500
And you know, one of those plagues in Israel's memory is it's

360
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.200
a locust place.

361
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.900
Check this out Deuteronomy 28 Deuteronomy 28

362
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.500
depicts God's covenant curse against this people and

363
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.700
you know what one of the curses against his people when they disobeyed God's

364
00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:58.900
word.

365
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:00.900
Locust plague

366
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.700
so you got Israel experiencing God's Deliverance through

367
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.500
a locust plague against Egypt Exodus 10.

368
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.200
You've got the Locust plague.

369
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.700
indicating

370
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.200
God's Judgment of his own people and Deuteronomy 28 check this out.

371
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.600
Look.

372
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700
Psalm 78

373
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.400
Echoes both Exodus 10 and the

374
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.800
failure of Israel in the pentateuch again through the Locust plague.

375
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.400
What about First Kings 8

376
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.100
this

377
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.700
text

378
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.200
Is where Solomon is crying out to God?

379
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.600
Talking to God in prayer and it depicts this Locust plague

380
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.700
as an enemy Invasion and indicates

381
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.600
Divine punishment. Do you see what's going on here?

382
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.000
Joel

383
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.400
Is triggering the memory of

384
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.800
God's word now. Here's the question. Why?

385
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.700
Because Joel is wanting to communicate.

386
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.400
That God's word is true.

387
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.500
And rule about you. Remember what God has done in the past. God

388
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.000
said what happened particularly if Israel disobeys

389
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.400
what happened to Egypt is going to happen to Israel

390
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.400
God's going to judge them because of their sin and Rebellion

391
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.000
against him.

392
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:16.700
Guess what?

393
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.500
The Locust plague is here an enemy

394
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.300
invasion is on the rise.

395
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.300
So the Locust plague triggers the memory of God's

396
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.000
word in judgment. What does

397
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.700
this teach us?

398
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.200
Listen to me God's word is true.

399
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:35.600
now

400
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.900
there are a lot of people in this room. There'll be a lot of people in the room to in

401
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.100
the next hour. Here's what I

402
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.300
will say to you not everyone actually believes that in this

403
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:46.300
room.

404
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.900
Not everyone actually believes God's word

405
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.600
is true and reliable.

406
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.700
He said well if I'm here on a Sunday, of course I do.

407
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.200
well

408
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.500
You know, I've I've worked in six churches in

409
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.700
three states and two countries.

410
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:07.700
right

411
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.400
and one of the things that I know

412
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.400
Is people are people and in a room this size you

413
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.800
got folks sitting in different seats, right? And one of

414
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.300
the seats could be I'm close to God. One of the seats could

415
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.200
be I'm far from God and one of the seats could be I don't care.

416
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.300
And because of that reality we know that

417
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.300
there are different people come into this room at different places.

418
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.400
And different places of trust and belief of God and his word

419
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.300
and I understand that.

420
00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.100
Here's what I would say to you and let me appeal to you as a

421
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:43.500
friend.

422
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.500
Joel

423
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.700
is reminding us through the Locust.

424
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.000
That God's word is true. If God says Rebellion

425
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.000
against him or neglect of him.

426
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.200
leads to disaster

427
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.500
that word is not an empty word and idle word or a

428
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.100
worthless word.

429
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.000
It's a true word.

430
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.700
And it's a good word. Why?

431
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.200
Because God's not doing it giving us this word

432
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.900
because he's mad.

433
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.200
He's given us this word because he loves us. Why sin and

434
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.200
Rebellion against God are neglect of

435
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:22.300
God.

436
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.100
Leads to disaster in your life and mine.

437
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.200
The first thing that I want to see from this lesson is

438
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.100
where are you in this room?

439
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.200
Maybe you're an out Rebellion against God or

440
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.600
just neglect like well, it's kind of like this. He's I I

441
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.500
like the word. I like God's word.

442
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.100
But you know, I'll get to it when I get to it. I want to

443
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.000
live my life a little bit.

444
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.100
I'm not rebelling against God. I'm just you know,

445
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.100
it's in my own time.

446
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.900
God's word has come. It's true. It's reliable In

447
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.600
this passage. It's a word of judgment.

448
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.500
Rebellion against God brings disaster

449
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.600
Rebellion is this active rejection

450
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.300
of what God has said for our lives.

451
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.400
The neglect that I was speaking about is a passive rejection

452
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.200
either way.

453
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.600
We're trying to approach God and his word on our terms.

454
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.900
God doesn't let us do that.

455
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.300
Whether an act of rebellion against God's word or passive neglect

456
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.300
of God's word. The reality is judgment is the

457
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.600
natural outcome of drawing away from God in

458
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.000
his word for Israel. This meant the land mourning

459
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.700
it meant animals suffering. It meant

460
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.400
famine it meant lack of worship it meant people

461
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.200
suffering and the entire land more.

462
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.600
The priests can't offer sacrifices why because

463
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.000
the people can't bring offerings.

464
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.700
They can't bring wine offerings. And so the wine dries

465
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.500
up from the land there can't be worship. This is

466
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.200
bad news.

467
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.800
lesson from the locusts

468
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.000
Now here's what we know.

469
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.400
If God's word of judgment is true my friends then listen.

470
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.500
God's word of Salvation is true as well.

471
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.000
And that's an incredibly comforting thought.

472
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.200
God teaches us in the scripture that

473
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.900
if we listen to his voice, we will find forgiveness

474
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.000
healing life purpose today

475
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.400
and forever my friends. We don't have to walk

476
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.000
aimlessly through life.

477
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.700
I'll just go to my cubicle make some dollars.

478
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.300
And just kind of muddle my window you don't have to lift that way.

479
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.600
Our God has something better for you to set

480
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.200
you on purpose

481
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.700
but he's giving us our word his words so that we can hear his voice.

482
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.400
And when we hear his voice and his offer

483
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.500
of Salvation we say yes.

484
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.200
We see here his word of forgiveness. We say

485
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.300
yes, we see here is word for life and

486
00:24:59.300 --> 00:24:59.900
we say yes.

487
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.700
Judgment is not God's first word in

488
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.000
Scripture.

489
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.500
It will not be God's last word.

490
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.700
God's first word for you and me is life joy peace

491
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.700
communion and relationship and you say Heath in

492
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.200
light of all this dark passage in Joel One. How can

493
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.000
you say that because I Look To the Cross

494
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.100
and we know this from when I was here about five years

495
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.500
ago.

496
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.900
And we walk through the Gospel of John together. Do you remember that?

497
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.400
And in the Gospel of John, do you know what John says about?

498
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.000
Jesus and God

499
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.200
for God so

500
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.000
loved

501
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.200
the world

502
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.400
That he condemned everybody to hell. Is that no what?

503
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.200
No, that's not what it says for God so loved the

504
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.100
world that he gave his only begotten son. Do you

505
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:57.400
remember this?

506
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.400
And whoever believes in him.

507
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.900
Should not perish.

508
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.600
But have everlasting life God's first word

509
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.400
for you and me is life.

510
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.000
But when we turn away from God's word.

511
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.400
disaster follows

512
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.500
knowing that God went to the far country of our sin in

513
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.000
Christ.

514
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.300
To bring us home.

515
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.100
Do you hear his word today?

516
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.800
That leads us to our second lesson.

517
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.000
God's word

518
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.400
requires response

519
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.000
God's word requires response.

520
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.700
I think it's fascinating in chapter one how many

521
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.700
imperatives shows up?

522
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.300
Imperatives are commands in the

523
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.000
Bible right imperatives or commands in English their commands

524
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.000
in Hebrew their commands in Greek imperatives. Are

525
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.600
this do this do that?

526
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.900
Don't do this. Don't do that. That's an imperative.

527
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.600
and if you look in this passage, you see a number of

528
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.200
imperatives why because when

529
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.400
God's word is given

530
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.700
human beings are required to respond.

531
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.800
God's word offers both death and life for

532
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.000
Israel In this passage.

533
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.300
For those who listen it's life for those

534
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.800
who refuse its death. Either way God's word

535
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.300
requires response. Look at the text.

536
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.400
I want you to look at various verses verses 8 and

537
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.100
13 God's people here personified

538
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.400
as a lady's Zion.

539
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.200
God's people should lament and mourn over

540
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.100
the loss of the relationship with God.

541
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.600
Verses 9 and 13 carry this image of lost forward

542
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.500
the priests.

543
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.000
Suffer the loss of people bringing sacrificial meals and are

544
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.000
called to repent.

545
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.300
and more

546
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.500
In verse 14 the whole land is ravaged and

547
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.700
God commands for a formal fast

548
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.900
in verse 14, but the point here is there

549
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.300
are various commands.

550
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.800
to lament and mourn

551
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.800
And to call a fast what's this the picture of lament and

552
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.200
mourn and fast, it's a picture of

553
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.700
repentance. What's the first response that God requires?

554
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.300
Repentance now what is repentance repentance can

555
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.000
be a lot of things. We think you know, it's just kind of saying God

556
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.900
my bad. I'll be better. No, that's not

557
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.200
worth appendices repentance is literally I

558
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.500
am walking this way.

559
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.600
God gets hold of my life.

560
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.700
And I turn around this way that's repenting

561
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.400
turning.

562
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.900
It's the idea that God has a

563
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.400
way and a word for my life and I am not listening

564
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.400
to it when I hear it. I turn.

565
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.300
I like the way that CS Lewis describes it. What am

566
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.600
I Heroes the CS Lewis in his book Mere Christianity. He

567
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.100
says this

568
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.700
Fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature

569
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.100
who needs Improvement.

570
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.000
He's a rebel who must lay down his

571
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.000
arms. What he's saying here is that repentance

572
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.800
is really not just only about turning this

573
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.200
way and going this way.

574
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.700
He's actually upping the ante and he's saying if we

575
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.400
recognize our fallen State our Rebellion

576
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.700
against God, actually we've got arms.

577
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.300
Guns that we're pointing against God.

578
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.700
Now that's silly for humans to do. We've got the Transcendent God

579
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.900
creator of the universe.

580
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.600
and then there's us

581
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.600
what chance do we have none?

582
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.500
But he captures it. He sees it. He understands it.

583
00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.200
Look what he says.

584
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.800
Laying down his arms laying down your arms surrendering

585
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.000
saying you're sorry realizing you've been on the

586
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.300
wrong track and getting ready to start life over again

587
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.100
from the ground floor. That's the only way out of

588
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.600
the hole.

589
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.100
This process of surrender this movement full speed

590
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:09.800
of stern.

591
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.600
is repentance

592
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.600
See, that's what God is calling for in John

593
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:15.700
1.

594
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.500
fast mourn lament repent

595
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.300
my friends in your life and mine.

596
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.600
Martin Luther says it this way.

597
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.100
Repentance is the door of the

598
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.900
Christian Life.

599
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.000
You want to know how to get on track with God?

600
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.600
Lay down your arms.

601
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.100
Turn around and run into the

602
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.600
arms of the God. Who saves you.

603
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.200
That's repentance.

604
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.900
And that's what God is calling for with.

605
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.500
these good people

606
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.600
That's the first response that the Locust teaches us if

607
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.200
you see the locusts repent.

608
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.200
Second action that we see in this passage.

609
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.700
Is this phrase cry out call out

610
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.100
to God for help?

611
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.700
Cry out call out to God for help.

612
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.800
Where we put down our guns?

613
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.300
And say Lord, I need you.

614
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.100
It's no surprise that the culminating imperative

615
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.400
or command that we receive in chapter one is in

616
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.500
verse 14 cry out.

617
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.400
Or Yahweh are the Lord in your translations?

618
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.800
Now this phrase cry out to God or the

619
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.400
Lord is a prayer for help. Do you know where else this

620
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.800
phrase shows up?

621
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.700
Exodus 2:23 where Israel

622
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.500
were slaves in Egypt

623
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.500
And what happens is in verses 23 and 24

624
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.900
of Exodus 2 is God's people suffering

625
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.800
under Affliction and slavery. They

626
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.400
look to God and they say we're in Dire Straits and

627
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.300
we and the languages the same in the Hebrew. They cry out

628
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.200
to God for help.

629
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.900
Now why do they do that?

630
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.300
Because there's only one voice that can save and

631
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:18.800
deliver.

632
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800
And it's the voice of God.

633
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.600
When you and I are experiencing extraordinary pain and suffering

634
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.600
and life whether it's self-inflicted the

635
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.200
work of enemies or even when

636
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.400
we feel forgotten by God.

637
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.100
We're in pain and suffering.

638
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.400
The Bible over and over and over again draws us

639
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.200
to this point in Joel 1:14, then again in verse

640
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.400
19 I call to God. I I not that

641
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.400
day or you or someone else I call to

642
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:51.500
God.

643
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.900
This cry for help.

644
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.300
Is real why because God's people know.

645
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.700
There's only one who's powerful to save.

646
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.700
Because God loves us.

647
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200
He loves to respond.

648
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.000
to our Christ

649
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.100
for help

650
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.700
I don't I've been praying about this how to

651
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.100
do this.

652
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.600
But this last Point has been very

653
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.200
personal for me and my family in

654
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.300
the past 72 hours.

655
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.100
When do we cry to God for help?

656
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.600
We cry to God for help when we're in pain.

657
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.300
We cry to God for help and we're confused.

658
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.400
We cry to God for help and we don't know what to do.

659
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.200
We cry to God for help when we are at the end of our

660
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.100
tether and we feel like we're about to fall in the

661
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.000
chasm. We cry to God for help.

662
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.500
Whenever life throws a curveball or Turns Upside

663
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:50.700
Down.

664
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.000
And I got to tell you in the past 72 hours, it

665
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.300
feels that way in up in my community.

666
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.400
Looking at the devastation of the tornado.

667
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.400
I got to tell you it's a miracle of God that no lives were

668
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:06.600
lost.

669
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.700
no injuries

670
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.000
It's in it's unbelievable walls torn

671
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.500
down portions of buildings ripped

672
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.000
off completely structural degradation.

673
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.700
Rayleigh Chapel is our one of our most iconic

674
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.100
buildings and when the tornado hit

675
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.000
and ripped

676
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.800
tonnage

677
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.200
up off of the ceiling.

678
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.300
We had about a couple hundred students in the basement in a

679
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.400
shelter.

680
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:41.700
And I got to tell you.

681
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.200
It's unbelievable.

682
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.300
That no lives were lost.

683
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.500
I look out across the devastation. We have 1.2 million

684
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.400
square feet on our campus.

685
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.000
Where 47 to 50 buildings depending on

686
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.000
how you're counting on our campus?

687
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.200
We have structural damage. Every building was impacted.

688
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.000
tree limbs two by fours inside of buildings

689
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.900
dumpsters big dumpsters

690
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.300
were carried hundreds of yards in the

691
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.700
air.

692
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.300
And hurled down to the ground.

693
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.800
a giant storage steel storage

694
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.000
container a 40 foot storage container

695
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.300
Was lifted in the air it was full.

696
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.300
And it was lifted in the air.

697
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.000
And landed on our baseball field.

698
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.000
destroying up

699
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.500
a pole and the entire storage container was

700
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.200
wrapped around this.

701
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.200
Pole light pole what I'm saying to you is it's unbelievable

702
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.600
what we've experienced.

703
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.000
The tornado was as big.

704
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.400
As our campus it hit the airport beside us

705
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.300
and into the communities all around us for at least

706
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.200
a mile and a half.

707
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.500
unbelievable

708
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.400
and when I think about that and I think about the lives that

709
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.100
are impact and I think about my seniors who are about

710
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.300
to graduate. You know, what our seniors have been through you. Could

711
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:15.800
you guys know?

712
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.600
covid

713
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.000
polar vortex going online I

714
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.500
Storm of the Century

inflation at a 50 year high

716
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.400
the great resignation. I mean all of these things and

717
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.900
now a tornado

718
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.500
where is the blood where's the frogs? Where's the boil? I

719
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.200
mean, it's crazy.

720
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.800
But in times like this, this is what we can do.

721
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.100
We can learn the lesson from the Locust.

722
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.400
And we can respond.

723
00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.200
and what I've discovered is

724
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.700
our God is a very present help in times of trouble.

725
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.200
and when we cry out

726
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.700
because we serve a loving God.

727
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.300
He loves to respond to our Christ.

728
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.200
So, can I get in your business a little bit?

729
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.100
I'm going to anyway, that was just a preacher thing

730
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.600
to do ask permission.

731
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.100
I'm gonna get in your business.

732
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.400
Do you have a family member or a son or

733
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.400
a daughter that's gone away and you don't know what to do.

734
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.300
Maybe you're battling substance Addiction in this

735
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:39.400
room.

736
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.800
Or some sort of addiction in the Stream.

737
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.800
And you're at the end of your rope. You don't know what to do.

738
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.400
You've got past hurt. You can't get past.

739
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.400
You have family trouble. You got work trouble. You lost your

740
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:53.500
job.

741
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.300
These things are not trivial to our God.

742
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.500
He already knows them.

743
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.400
The opportunity that we have from The Book of Joel.

744
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.700
Is to hear God's word.

745
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:11.900
and respond

746
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.800
maybe today you need to repent.

747
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.600
You've never come into a saving relationship with the God who made

748
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.800
you and the God who saved you.

749
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.400
And you've been neglecting God. Oh, I'll respond to mind

750
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.300
on my time. It's kind of like you think it's a

751
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.100
it's like those, you know telemarketers who call and you say

752
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.100
are you interested in this special offer? No, not today. I'll get back to

753
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.600
it. Later.

754
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.300
Here, can I just encourage you?

755
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.100
We don't respond to God in our time.

756
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.800
when I want to

757
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.800
when God's word is given.

758
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.300
the time of response is

759
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:51.600
now

760
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.500
we respond now.

761
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.900
So if you're neglecting God's word and say oh I'll

762
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.100
get to it on my time.

763
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.000
You don't if there's anything I know after the

764
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.500
past 72 hours. We're not guaranteed tomorrow.

765
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.600
Today is the day of salvation for you.

766
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.600
Some of us in this room are experiencing extreme pain and hurt.

767
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.000
And you've already asked the Lord to forgive you

768
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.300
of your sin. You've turned you've laid down your arms, but you're

769
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.500
going through some stuff. You don't quite know how to deal with.

770
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.700
God's given us a word to which we can respond.

771
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.000
cry out to him

772
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.000
As best I know how to say it.

773
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.700
God will meet us.

774
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600
God will hear us.

775
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.400
And God will answer us now.

776
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.400
I can guarantee you maybe his answer.

777
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.000
Might not be the answer. We were hoping for or looking for.

778
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.000
I've been asking God and Les knows this

779
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.500
in the past three years since I've been a president at OBU we've

780
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.800
been praying for divine favor wisdom insight

781
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.400
and miracles.

782
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.200
Well, I believe God's answering.

783
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.100
But I don't think I would have ever wanted him

784
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.300
to answer the way that he's answered.

785
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:14.600
now

786
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.200
God's response and the way God answers our Christ for help

787
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.900
or his business. Not ours.

788
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.100
Our job is just to trust him.

789
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.400
The important thing you need to hear from from

790
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.400
me today. Is that God hears our Christ?

791
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:32.900
So you can cry.

792
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.500
He loves you.

793
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.600
I want to invite you to stand with me.

794
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.400
And I want to pray over you.

795
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.500
lessons from the Locust

796
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.800
God's word is true.

797
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.000
And God's word requires response. How are you

798
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.000
going to respond today?

799
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.400
Our Father we thank you
