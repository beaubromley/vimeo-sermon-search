00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.900
Well, good morning again Church. It is a joy to

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.400
gather together. As always. We should

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.600
not take this for granted even in the summer and it

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.300
is something that we look forward to if you're

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.200
new. We would love to get to know you. We want to meet you

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.100
if you can muster up the courage to come

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.100
and reduce yourself to us. So we'd love to if not yet. We would love to

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.300
just get your information on our website. There's a connect card

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.000
there would love to to reach out and pray for

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.500
you and encourage you how best we can.

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200
But if you've been around Henderson Hills for any length of time, you know

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.300
that a couple years ago. We started a journey through the book

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.000
of Psalms in the Old Testament. Just one by one one through

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600
150 and we would take normally

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
the Summers to do that and kind of take 15

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.000
years to eventually get through all of them. I think but side

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.300
note this summer. We're actually not going to go through this

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.100
Psalms. We're gonna go back into the Book of Luke and just look at the The Parables

19
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.400
that Jesus taught there about the secrets of

20
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.600
his kingdom in story form. So we'll

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.000
spend time back in the Book of Luke as we have the last few months.

22
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.200
But we've used these Psalms also not just

23
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.500
for Summers but to fit in on holidays or in between

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.200
series and it's just again, whatever is the next one

25
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
up is the one that we preach and so

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100
that's why we're in today Psalm 49. So take

27
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.200
your copy of God's word and turn with me there the Big Book

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.900
of Psalms right about the middle of the Bible. You'll find it.

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
And we'll be there Psalm 49 by the

30
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.500
way 150 remember in the Book of Psalms. We're

31
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.200
almost a third of the way through which is kind of wild to think if

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.700
you've been here for a couple years. You've seen us walk this journey.

33
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.500
now as you're turning there I last week I preached on

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500
giving

35
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.400
this next Psalm up just happens to be about money

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.900
as well.

37
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.000
Now it will take a bit of a different angle compared to

38
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.500
what second Corinthians 8 and 9 took last week.

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.100
Which talked about the call for every believer to give generously what

40
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.000
we're going to see today.

41
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.700
instead

42
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.500
Is the temporal futility of money?

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.400
of wealth

44
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
society around us upholds

45
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.400
and celebrates extravagant wealth

46
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.600
celebrities

47
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.700
business Moguls that they're all the successful ones in the

48
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.900
world

49
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.800
even in our area that we live in

50
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.900
wealth can equal importance

51
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.300
but Psalm 49 shows us clearly none of

52
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.100
that lasts.

53
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.300
None of that last that what the world marks as

54
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
success is not necessarily successful according to

55
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.600
God.

56
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.500
And we'll see that today. We need to change the

57
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.700
scorecard of what we see success

58
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.700
in life really meaning.

59
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.300
Especially that wealth is not the ultimate measure

60
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.100
of worth and value.

61
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.500
And it does nothing to change the end result

62
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.600
for anyone.

63
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.500
Flat out the truth. Is that all of us?

64
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.000
Will die at some point.

65
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.500
And so just like I said that statement the rest

66
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.300
of this song will sound pretty bleak at times right? Happy

67
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.500
Memorial Day weekend, right this it's gonna

68
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.300
sound pretty it's gonna sound like Ecclesiastes a lot

69
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.800
of this will

70
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.400
Just sounds distressing and hard at times.

71
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.300
So that's part of what we need to understand because the lower that

72
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.800
that gets and the way we feel about that makes this other

73
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.300
truth that we find in Psalm 49 that

74
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.100
much sweeter.

75
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.000
There's something we can't miss today.

76
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
Since Psalm 49 will we won't miss

77
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.300
this that that we will see that wealth does not equal

78
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.500
importance. Yes, but the best part of today's sermon you

79
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.600
might need to hang with me a little bit to get there is that death does

80
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.900
not equal the end for those who believe in the Lord?

81
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.000
We might say it this way that neither wealth nor death

82
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.000
has the final word.

83
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.200
Neither wealth nor death has the final word in our lives.

84
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.400
That's what Psalm 49 will show us. So let's look at the first four verses to

85
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.500
begin with.

86
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.300
Hear this all peoples give ear

87
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.100
all inhabitants of the world both low and high

88
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
rich and poor together my mouth shall speak wisdom the

89
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.100
meditation of my heart shall be understanding. I will

90
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.100
incline my ear to a proverb. I'll solve my riddle to

91
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.900
the music of the liar.

92
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.300
Now, let's just get the context here. We need to understand who's talking here.

93
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.500
Just look at the heading right above it often. It says

94
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.200
who wrote it. And so this heading says this is a

95
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.500
a congregational singable Psalm or

96
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.600
a song written by the sons of Korah who

97
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.000
were the guys that led the music in the temple?

98
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200
They were the worship team the songwriters for the people of

99
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.700
Israel and they wrote this one.

100
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.800
Specifically for a reason they will say in

101
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.100
a moment, but their first talking

102
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.800
to who they're talking to right they here listen up.

103
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.000
As they get into the first four verses that introduction says this

104
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.100
is to everyone.

105
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.300
all the inhabitants of the world

106
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.200
now not just all nations right notice. It says all classes

107
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.500
of people you might say both low and

108
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.100
high rich and poor together. No one

109
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.300
is excluded from the truths are

110
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.800
about to share.

111
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.200
Because again the theme of this psalm.

112
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.300
As we get into this is that that some could think that

113
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.700
wealth might play a role in delivering someone

114
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.900
from Pain and death.

115
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.400
That's the the point we'll see here. And so the sons

116
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.700
of Korah look around the world and they see this happening and

117
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.300
we'll see it what they're talking about in a second, but they see all

118
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.500
of this happen and they think okay here are Universal

119
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500
truths that everyone needs to hear that all

120
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.100
the people all the classes in the world need to understand listen up.

121
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.300
That's what they say here. These verses three and four are talking about this this

122
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.700
wisdom. They gain from looking at the world from understanding what

123
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.500
God wants and they say okay now here, let me

124
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.500
share what I need to share.

125
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.300
So for the people of Israel, that was what they were hearing was saying,

126
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.900
all right, listen up and you'll be able to sing these truths as a congregation

127
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.300
together, but us now a couple thousand years

128
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.500
later.

129
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.000
We get to read these words.

130
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.300
It's almost like God is shouting these truths to us in a

131
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.500
megaphone.

132
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.400
Like the first four verses for them, but for us today God is

133
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.400
screaming at us to remember he's trying

134
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.600
to get her attention to listen to what he's about to say saying

135
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.000
these things are really really important.

136
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.200
And he's talking to you whether you have the

137
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.300
kind of wealth that might tempt you to feel like this.

138
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.300
Or you just want that kind of wealth from somebody else

139
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.100
you want that kind of life.

140
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.800
So he's screaming at us.

141
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.200
To remember and to listen what he's about to

142
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.500
say.

143
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.500
So look at verses 5 through 20, here's what God inspired these authors to

144
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.000
say about wealth and death.

145
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.200
Why should I fear in times of trouble?

146
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.300
When the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me those who

147
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.400
trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their

148
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.700
riches.

149
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.000
Truly, no, man. Can Ransom another or give to God the price of

150
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.500
his life?

151
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.000
For The Ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice that

152
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.000
he should live on forever and never see the pit.

153
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.100
For he sees that even the wise die.

154
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.200
The fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to

155
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.500
others.

156
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.700
Their graves are their homes forever. They're Dwelling

157
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.200
Places to all generations though. They called

158
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.500
lands by their own names when they're alive.

159
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.400
Man in his pump will not remain. He's like

160
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.800
the beasts that perish.

161
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.800
This is the path of those who have foolish confidence.

162
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.100
Yet after them. They the people approve of their

163
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.700
boasts.

164
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.100
Like sheep, they are appointed for sheol. That's the place

165
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.600
of the Dead Death Shall be their Shepherd and the upright shall

166
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.500
rule over them in the morning.

167
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.400
Their form shall be consumed and shield with no place to

168
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:29.700
dwell.

169
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.200
But God will Ransom my soul from

170
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.700
the power of sheol for he will receive me.

171
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.300
Be not Afraid when a man becomes rich when the

172
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.600
glory of his house increases for when he dies he'll

173
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.300
carry nothing away his glory will not go down after him

174
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.500
For though while he lives he counts himself blessed and though

175
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.200
you get praise when you do well for yourself.

176
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.700
His soul will go to the generation of his father's who will

177
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.700
never again see light.

178
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.900
Man in his pomp yet without understanding or wisdom is

179
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.700
like the beasts that perish.

180
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.800
So you see what's going on here, right?

181
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.300
The sons of Korah are looking around at the world

182
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.400
and their culture and they're seeing how

183
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.200
some we're trusting in their own wealth to deliver

184
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.300
them.

185
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.400
Now what do we mean when trusting and wealth? What does that mean? It means

186
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.600
that people were finding security and finding

187
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.100
hope in their wealth.

188
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.200
They were identifying their worth and their value by

189
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.900
how much money they have.

190
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.300
They were even assuming that they were Limitless.

191
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.700
Like I can do anything I want I can last forever.

192
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.300
So that's part of the culture, but then they're also looking

193
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.000
around. They're seeing other people who were Longing To Be

194
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.400
wealthy so they might be free from Death too.

195
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.500
Now really, I really want at the very least just Desiring to

196
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.500
be able to live that Carefree kind of life.

197
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.700
That wealth gives you everything you could ever want Hakuna Matata,

198
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.200
right? Everything is good and all my life is perfect.

199
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.000
Is that not happening around us just as much today?

200
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.700
Whether it's devouring page, six or People

201
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.300
magazine or TMZ or Entertainment Tonight, whatever

202
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.000
one you pick right we can so easily Envy

203
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.500
those celebrities lives.

204
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.400
or

205
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.600
maybe it's not that for you.

206
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.300
We observe people around us even in our area

207
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:39.700
here.

208
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.100
our neighbors our coworkers

209
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.600
driving nicer cars

210
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.100
living on the golf course or expensive Vacations

211
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.900
or whatever else.

212
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.700
And there's this subtle.

213
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.000
or maybe even potentially blatant desire

214
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.400
to have that kind of life.

215
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.300
To live as if we have no concerns or

216
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.300
cares in the world that we can live a perfect life that we're

217
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.300
really infinite. We can be Limitless. Look at what we can have and

218
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:13.400
do

219
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.800
If you've ever read John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, what we're

220
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.900
talking about is Vanity Fair.

221
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.200
right

222
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.500
things all about image and portraying a

223
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.400
perfect life.

224
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.500
So that's happening around us even still but but further than

225
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.100
that people like we saw in Psalm 49 people are still

226
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.300
cheating other people to gain wealth.

227
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.500
They're boasting an evil excess and and

228
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.500
looking at how big we can get our yachts and

229
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.600
and all of these things are out there and other people are fawning all

230
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.400
over them telling them how wonderful they are because they're so successful

231
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.100
in business or whatever else they did.

232
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.600
It's what verse 12 and verse 20 call pomp.

233
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.600
which to OSU students at homecoming means one thing

234
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.300
To high school students graduating means another thing right? That

235
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.700
song is Pomp and Circumstance you walk into a graduation.

236
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.400
But that word pump merely means honor.

237
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.800
It's giving someone an apparently higher

238
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.100
status over others in that moment.

239
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.100
So these people look like they are

240
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.700
higher they are better. They are more valuable than anybody

241
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.400
else's.

242
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.000
Yet God is picking up the megaphone today.

243
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.200
To them at the time to us this first

244
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.100
universal truth. He's making it very clear wealth cannot

245
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.000
deliver from death.

246
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.800
Wealth cannot deliver from Death no

247
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.300
matter how much you have.

248
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.100
No matter how secure You Think You Are.

249
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600
wealth cannot

250
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.400
deliver from death and pain and sorrow

251
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.400
now people try to thwart that all the time don't they?

252
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.500
We try to hold it at Bay. Keep it back there. We don't want to deal with

253
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.600
it. But the realities that death is coming for each one of

254
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:21.900
us.

255
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.300
Hebrews 9:27 it's appointed for man to die

256
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.200
once and after that to face the judgment.

257
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.100
Part of the deal now and remember that's not

258
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.300
just poor people dying.

259
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.600
Relatively poor people die. No those people

260
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.500
might think that if I can just get more wealth if I can get more stuff

261
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.300
if I can live like them then maybe I won't

262
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.600
be in trouble. Maybe I'll be safe.

263
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.000
No Ecclesiastes 9 says it's the same for all.

264
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.300
Since the same event happens to the righteous and to the wicked to

265
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.100
the good to the evil to the rich and to the poor death happens to

266
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.400
all of us. So the solution to that

267
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.200
is not gaining more wealth.

268
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.300
That's not the fix.

269
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.300
Because verse 7 said all the wealth in the world is not enough to redeem even

270
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.700
one soul.

271
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.500
So you can't redeem you can't save yourself plus you

272
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.800
can't take any of it with you.

273
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.200
Some of you have probably heard the old preacher joke that you

274
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.900
never see a hearse pulling a U-Haul.

275
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.100
Actually researching that this week. I did see a picture of a hearse of

276
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.600
the U-Haul. I almost showed it to you, but I was like, that's probably not best but

277
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.700
That's the point right the point here. You see it in verse 17.

278
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.400
When he dies He Will Carry nothing away. His glory

279
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.600
will not go down after him. No matter how glorious your life was.

280
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.700
It doesn't go with you.

281
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.300
You can't carry anything with you. In fact verse 10 adds not

282
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.100
only will you not take it with you. You'll actually leave it all to

283
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.300
other people.

284
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.600
Meaning it's going to somebody else.

285
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.100
That's why Jesus said

286
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.800
some piercing words in Matthew 6 about wealth

287
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.100
He said do not lay up for yourself Treasures on

288
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:08.400
Earth.

289
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.100
Where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in

290
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.300
and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven?

291
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.300
Where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves

292
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.200
don't break in and steal for where your treasure

293
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.300
is there. Your heart will be also

294
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.200
No, one can serve two masters for either.

295
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.900
He will hate the one and love the other.

296
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.200
Or he'll be devoted to the one and despise the other.

297
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.400
You cannot serve God and money.

298
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.200
What Jesus is asking us there?

299
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.500
Is what is dominating your heart?

300
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.300
What is your master? What controls you what

301
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.200
are you serving?

302
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.100
What directs the decisions you make?

303
00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800
He says you can't.

304
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.400
You can't have both.

305
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.800
You can't serve both you can you can have money and serve

306
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.700
the Lord or you can have the Lord and serve

307
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.300
money.

308
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.800
He says which one do you want?

309
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.100
And you again you can't take it with you. This is

310
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.400
all gonna fall apart in the end. That's why I love what one author

311
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.400
put it. He said when considering this idea. He said you can't

312
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.300
take it with you. No, but you can send it on ahead.

313
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.300
So what does that mean?

314
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.300
You can't take it with you, but you can send it on

315
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.400
ahead what he means like Jesus said everything here is

316
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.300
going to break. It's gonna wear out. It's gonna get stolen or when

317
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.800
you die. It's gonna be giving away to somebody else.

318
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.200
That's why First Timothy six refers to it as the uncertainty of

319
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.300
riches meaning should not put your hope in something

320
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.800
uncertain like riches.

321
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.500
That means there are no sure assets here. It's all temporary. It's

322
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.500
all fickle.

323
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.400
But what that means is whatever you invest in eternity

324
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.800
will never depreciate.

325
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.500
It will never spoil it will never get stolen. It

326
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.300
is secure.

327
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.200
So what Jesus is asking us to do is to start

328
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.400
considering where we invest our resources?

329
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.400
Do you invest in the temporary fickle things and get stolen break

330
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.300
the stock market crashes you can lose it or do you invest

331
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.300
in something secure Eternal forever and ever going to

332
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.000
be valuable?

333
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.500
Pick that one.

334
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.200
Start treasuring Eternal things.

335
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.500
Like gospel Ministry feeding the hungry helping the sick

336
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.300
writing wrongs in the world on and on we can list out

337
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.600
hundreds of things focus on those things way more

338
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.200
than the temporary unsatisfying things.

339
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.400
We often focus on

340
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.500
you can't take with you. It's going to break. It's going to go away. It could

341
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.100
be stolen all of that.

342
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.700
Jesus says make a value judgment here.

343
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.500
We swim in the poison of

344
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.400
materialism here.

345
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.400
And one of the main antidotes to that is generosity.

346
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.400
Open-handed giving away saying I

347
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.300
can't take it with me. It's going to

348
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.300
go away. Anyway, so Jesus, I'm won't invest

349
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.100
this for your kingdom.

350
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.900
for your good

351
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.700
so I talked about last Sunday that nearly more than anything else.

352
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.100
Your view on money reveals your heart.

353
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.100
reveals your priorities

354
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.200
What am I focused on I could say

355
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.600
one thing. But if I live another thing it shows it in real

356
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:38.800
way.

357
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.800
So like Psalm 49 shows us here. You might consider yourself

358
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.200
blessed when you have more than other people do.

359
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.300
You might consider even others might

360
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.400
might praise you for your wealth and your success in business

361
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.400
and all of these other things that you've you've done well for yourself.

362
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.200
It says people say to us right and people might

363
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.600
praise you for all of that.

364
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.300
But don't be arrogant and think that the grave is

365
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.300
not your end as well.

366
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.100
Just like verse 20 said just like all the animals.

367
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.200
Riches, do not guarantee freedom from

368
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.400
sorrow from loss from death.

369
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.900
Death is the great leveler.

370
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.100
Right, no matter how much you have or don't have we all hit that

371
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.600
at some point?

372
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.400
and so now at this point you see why I started with

373
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.500
why I started is

374
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.800
Heavy distressing feels like Ecclesiastes,

375
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.300
like it's all hopeless. It's all meaningless.

376
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.300
But we needed to feel so Psalm 49 does

377
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.600
needed just to feel.

378
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.300
The weight of this that all of us are

379
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.300
facing this but what I'm about to talk about is what

380
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.100
I wanted to get to as quickly as I could in Psalm 49.

381
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.100
because for all the things that we've seen wealth cannot do

382
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.600
what we need to hear next is what God will do.

383
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.300
That yes wealth cannot Deliver Us

384
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.100
from Dell from Death. Yes.

385
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.400
But God will Deliver us from death.

386
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.400
You see where we're going with this now, right?

387
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.400
This is why we need to shouting this to each other. And

388
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.400
from God that God will Deliver us

389
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.400
from death. Yes death is coming. But verse 15

390
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.900
shows us a different outcome.

391
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.700
It says God will deliver Ransom my

392
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.300
soul from the power of Shield the power of death

393
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.200
for he will receive me.

394
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.800
He doesn't deny that reality of death.

395
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.800
I mean Sin from the Garden of Eden Adams

396
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.600
original sin means everything's broken. Every one

397
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.400
of us are on track towards death. Our bodies are falling

398
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.700
apart. The world is falling apart because of Adam's sin.

399
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.400
That is a reality.

400
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.400
And I don't want to.

401
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.300
Make light of that.

402
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.700
Because there's many people in our country this week even today.

403
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.100
Even people in our church this week facing the

404
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.500
reality of physical death in a very real raw

405
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.900
way.

406
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.100
And so we we know this it's heavy as we

407
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.400
face this we think about our own but then other people that we

408
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.300
love around us. We see these things happening around us.

409
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.500
but again for the believer

410
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.100
physical death, it's not the end of the story.

411
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.300
Yes, it's a reality but it's not the end of the story

412
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.600
remember verses 7 through 9.

413
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.100
Look again if Psalm 49 7 through 9 truly no

414
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.700
man. Can Ransom another or give to God the price of his life?

415
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.500
For The Ransom of their life is costly can never suffice that

416
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.600
he should live on forever and never see the pit again. No

417
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.300
one can buy their way out of this. It's coming for all

418
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.200
of us. We can't buy somebody else's way out of death. The price of

419
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.100
a life is far too high. Nobody has that kind of

420
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.300
money.

421
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.400
So we could not but praise God that he could.

422
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.200
We can't he can none of us could pay that

423
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.200
price. We're all sinful so I can't pay the price for your sin.

424
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.100
You can't pay the price for my sin no amount of

425
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.200
money could but listen First Peter 1 says you

426
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.300
are not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold or

427
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.100
money, but with Precious Blood as of a

428
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.200
lamb unblemished and spotless the bread of Christ.

429
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.400
So it's not with money. It's not with anything else. It's

430
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.000
with the blood of Jesus in your place.

431
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.600
Nothing else can Deliver us from death?

432
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.900
no pleasure can

433
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.200
no anti-aging cream that you buy at 2AM off

434
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.400
the TV.

435
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.900
No religion, no good works. None of

436
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.500
that can save you from dying. That was

437
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.300
verse 7, right? No, man. Can Ransom another or give to

438
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.300
God the price of his life The Ransom of their life is costly that

439
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.600
is absolutely true, but man can't the

440
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.800
God man can't

441
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.600
Right, you see that?

442
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.200
It's just tracking through scripture. I'm just gonna read scripture. I'm

443
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.400
not gonna reference it. But this is just the track of what Jesus did for

444
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.100
us. He himself bore our sins and his body on the

445
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.500
cross that we might die to sin and live to righteousness giving us

446
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.100
Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of our

447
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.200
trespasses according to the riches of his grace. He gave his

448
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.700
life as a ransom for many reconciling us to God through his

449
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.500
death saving us by his life purchasing purchasing

450
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.000
us with a price giving his life as a ransom. That's

451
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.300
what the God man could do that we could never

452
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:44.500
do

453
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.500
Okay, just making sure you got that.

454
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.800
That's what Jesus did for us

455
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.300
that we could never do for ourselves that

456
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.600
you could never do for me I could never do for you man. In

457
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.800
ourselves. We can't but the God man could.

458
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.200
and he did

459
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.400
but that's the point Church.

460
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.600
That's the point here is that you could do nothing to

461
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.100
keep death at Bay. It's coming for each one of

462
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.400
us. We don't know when it might be tomorrow. It might be 70 years from now.

463
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.300
We have no idea but death does not have the final word

464
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.200
for those who repented and believed in Jesus Christ and his work

465
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:26.800
in their place.

466
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.500
Because of that God will deliver from

467
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.600
Death those who believe.

468
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.500
It's what first Thessalonians 5 says that Christ died

469
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:36.900
for us.

470
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.800
So that whether we are awake meaning alive or

471
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.500
whether we are asleep dead we might

472
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.400
live with him.

473
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.700
Like whether we are alive or dead we live with him.

474
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.300
That's eternal life not physical life.

475
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:55.600
how

476
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.500
because Romans 6:5 says if we've been United with him in a death

477
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.300
like his we shall certainly be United with him in a resurrection like

478
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:03.700
his

479
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.100
because remember the father redeemed Ransom delivered

480
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.400
the son from Death not by keeping

481
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.500
him from death, but by raising him after death

482
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.200
First Christmas 15 says that's what he's gonna do with us who believe?

483
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.600
We are united with him in a resurrection like

484
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.200
his.

485
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:28.600
so again

486
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.000
Listen carefully Church.

487
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.400
death

488
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.500
for the believer does not have the final word.

489
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.900
It does not have the final say it is

490
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.500
not the end. Yes, your body

491
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.800
will give out. Yes cancer will rage tragedies

492
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.200
occur.

493
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.600
Babies will be lost. But for those who trust

494
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.500
in Jesus God will deliver them

495
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.200
from death.

496
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.200
And we can rejoice in that we can have hope in

497
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.200
that when we Face such hard times.

498
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200
Now we could be done right there.

499
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.100
And be good, right?

500
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.500
We encouraged.

501
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.300
But this is what's interesting about Psalm 49 when you read carefully in

502
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.300
these things this whole discussion versus five through

503
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.300
20 talking about these two truths of wealth and death.

504
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.400
There's only one command in the whole thing.

505
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.200
All of these truths there's only one command and that command is

506
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.300
in verse 16 be not afraid.

507
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.200
Sons of Korah here are looking around at the chaos of

508
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.100
their world. They're seeing all of the trappings of the world. They're seeing

509
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.400
people live for the wrong things. They're seeing wealth does

510
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.600
not equal importance death does not equal the end and they result

511
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.300
with this command. They say don't fear.

512
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.000
When they have these truths in their mind.

513
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.300
The wealth is not important death is not the end and they

514
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.400
say as a result of that don't fear.

515
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.700
Verse 5. Why should I fear in times of trouble?

516
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.600
Why should I fear when people accumulate a lot or or attack

517
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.300
me or mistreat other people? I shouldn't fear.

518
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.100
Why because I can trust the future justice of

519
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:16.300
God.

520
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.400
That no matter how much of a celebrity they are.

521
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.100
How much money or power they seem to have no matter how much they seem

522
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.500
to be in in a higher class

523
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.000
than me.

524
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.300
Death is still coming for them, too.

525
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.400
If you remember Hebrews 9:27.

526
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.400
It's important for man to death to die once and after that

527
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.400
comes the judgment.

528
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.300
Meaning it doesn't matter who that person is. They are going to stand before

529
00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.300
God just like you are.

530
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.500
Right that God will judge every

531
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.000
single person on the same playing

532
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.500
field here.

533
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.500
No matter what the glory of their life look like. It's all

534
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.900
coming down to this. One moment.

535
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.100
And so it's all going to even out. I don't

536
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.200
have to fear the world looking different. I feel

537
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.300
the way things are being done. The way people are living. I don't

538
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:10.600
fear that.

539
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.400
But then also the twin truth is that I don't have to fear death

540
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.300
myself anymore.

541
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.200
I don't have to fear because I know that's not the end of the story if

542
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.500
my trust is in Christ. I don't have to fear it I can face

543
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.400
it because he faced it for me.

544
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.600
And again, those are the truths. We need God to be shouting to

545
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.100
us to be reminding us of because when we look around

546
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.400
we see a whole lot of things going right we're tempted to fear every

547
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.100
single day.

548
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.100
Sure seems like the rich are getting richer. They're getting away

549
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.200
with it get in every way. They seem like they have no

550
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.300
consequence there. They're getting money at the expense of

551
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.000
other people look at how this is working.

552
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.500
Many people live in like their own touchable. They're infinite. They're that

553
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.300
they're there have this hashtag blessed life that because look at

554
00:28:59.300 --> 00:28:59.900
what they've accomplished.

555
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.600
And we're tempted to be fearful and afraid of

556
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.300
what's going on with that.

557
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.200
But then even all of us listen, this is not just about everybody else

558
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.600
out there.

559
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.700
Even all of us inside of ourselves battle this

560
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.400
subtle demonic Force.

561
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.900
Where we long for what God has not given us.

562
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.700
And We crave

563
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.600
Because we're so discontent.

564
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.600
crave

565
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.600
new things

566
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.600
same day delivery

567
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.000
We crave like this is going to satisfy me this is going to

568
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.200
fill me and so we keep making Target runs to fill that hole in

569
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.700
our hearts

570
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.000
Right. So we're trying to to fill there's this subtle demonic

571
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.500
force in us saying you're gonna get that and

572
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.300
you'll be happy you're gonna get that and you'll be happy you're gonna feel that

573
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.100
and you're gonna be satisfied.

574
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.700
But this is where we can be different Church.

575
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.400
This right here is where we can be different. When we remember those truths

576
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.000
that neither wealth nor death has the final word.

577
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.500
That wealth doesn't equal importance death doesn't equal

578
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.100
the end. We keep that in our mind. It sinks into our souls.

579
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.800
We have nothing to fear.

580
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.700
Here's how we can be different.

581
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.200
That's how we can then live open-handed lives where we

582
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.300
know we can't take anything with us. So we Steward it all today for God's

583
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.500
glory.

584
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.900
We use whatever he's entrusted to us, whatever blessing financially

585
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.500
he gives us. It's for him. It's for others we

586
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.800
can see that this can be our lives reimagining our

587
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.900
generosity for his kingdom.

588
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.300
When we remember that we can then also at the

589
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.700
same time live lives free from jealousy and envy.

590
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.100
Because somebody else has more than I do.

591
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.500
We can live like that because we know that that's not where

592
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.300
true life is found.

593
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.400
Yeah, I don't have as much as they do but that's not true life. Anyway,

594
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.700
Jesus Is My Life?

595
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.200
when we remember those twin truths, they sing to

596
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.200
our soul we can live with no fear of even death because we

597
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.400
know that we know that it's not the end

598
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.100
that that

599
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.300
Jesus that we worship that we talk about

600
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.300
that he is on the other side and what

601
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.800
that means that there's a better life on the other side.

602
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.400
with the Lord

603
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.200
That's that perspective is how you can face cancer.

604
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.700
With joy and with hope knowing whatever suffering will

605
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.100
come is terrible, but you know what's on the

606
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.600
other side of it?

607
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.800
That's how you can even face old age with anticipation and

608
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.400
passion.

609
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.700
Where you see?

610
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.400
That you don't have to fearfully cling so much to

611
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.200
this world. You're gonna lose something. You're actually

612
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.700
gonna gain something.

613
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.600
What we're saying in all of this?

614
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.800
Is this is how you live out? What Philippians 1:21

615
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.300
says Paul says for me to live is

616
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.900
Christ and to die is gain.

617
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.700
That if I if I die.

618
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.700
If I die that that is actually better than

619
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.100
anything else this world can offer because I'm

620
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:36.900
Gonna Be With Jesus.

621
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.700
To die is gain now don't misunderstand me

622
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.000
in this.

623
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.400
This doesn't mean for you to accelerate your death, right? That's not what

624
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.400
we're talking about because God still has a purpose for you as long

625
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.200
as you are alive.

626
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.600
No matter what, you're feeling what you're thinking right now. He has a purpose for you. But

627
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.200
if you do die in his natural course of

628
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.500
whatever you face he is saying to you that's better.

629
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.600
In the end look you gain.

630
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.300
No matter how great it is in this world today. It is gain and

631
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.000
if you live

632
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.400
which all of us are until God takes us home. If I live

633
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.200
then my goal now becomes not just to stay

634
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.600
alive or not just to to be comfortable my goal

635
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.500
now becomes to live my life as Christ has lived

636
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.000
his life for me.

637
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.400
To live is Christ meaning life is

638
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.900
his it's all for him.

639
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.900
So whether I live or whether he takes me home.

640
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:35.800
have

641
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.200
joy

642
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.100
when this truth that neither wealth nor death has

643
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.600
the final word when that takes root in your heart. This is

644
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.200
the kind of shift. God will make in your heart and your life.

645
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.100
That you can live totally differently because I have nothing

646
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.900
to fear here and nothing to fear there.

647
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.100
And so unbeliever. Let me talk to you for a second.

648
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.500
If you don't believe thank you for being your first of all.

649
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:07.600
Keep coming.

650
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.100
but if you are honest

651
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.300
You know pain and death is coming your

652
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.000
way at some point.

653
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.500
You can't keep it from happening.

654
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.100
Nothing, you do can defeat it. You're gonna

655
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.200
have to deal with it at some point.

656
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.700
It's alive from the world that you will not stand before God someday.

657
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.100
So the question is what are you going to trust in when you

658
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.500
stand before God on that day?

659
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.500
What are you going to say? Here's what I got.

660
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.400
And it's going to be working. It's going to work. Is it your

661
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:46.600
wealth?

662
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.400
Is it your good deeds that you did enough good things and you're generous in

663
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.300
your life. And you weren't a jerk. Like is that what's you're gonna put up in

664
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:54.500
front of him?

665
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.600
Is it the your family and your story and

666
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.200
your history that you grew up in a Christian Hall? Is that is that what

667
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.600
you're gonna put in front of him?

668
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.900
You've seen it. None of that's enough.

669
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.000
The only way you will stand there and have any justifiable

670
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.000
reason to stay standing there is when you

671
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.300
trust in Jesus and his work in your place.

672
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.400
Nothing you can do to earn it. It's all Jesus

673
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.500
for you, and you must Trust.

674
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200
That so don't trust in anything else.

675
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.400
But then believer, let me speak to you as well to me

676
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.000
myself.

677
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.300
I hope you see how this challenges us.

678
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.500
a couple of questions

679
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.100
Where are you misplacing your priorities in

680
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.600
light of these truths Jesus as

681
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.600
your joy and Jesus as your eternal life.

682
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.300
Put a different way.

683
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.600
What are you living for today? That won't matter anything

684
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.500
ten years ten thousand years from now.

685
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.700
What are you living for today? That won't matter anything 10,000 years

686
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.100
from now.

687
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.500
That when you stand around the Throne of Christ, it will not matter at

688
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:14.700
all.

689
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.800
That's the

690
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.000
temporary treasure Eternal treasure stuff

691
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.800
What are you living for today? What are you focused on

692
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.400
that looks no different than the values of

693
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.600
the world all around us.

694
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.400
Because that's the question if we have this eternal perspective don't you

695
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.000
think we should start living distinctly?

696
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.600
If we have an eternal hope if we have no fear in Life or in

697
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.600
death, then we should be living differently.

698
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.400
I should be living differently than my neighbors because

699
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.700
I have an eternal hope.

700
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.100
But what does that look like? Well Hebrews 13:5

701
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.500
prescribes a way for us as it says keep your

702
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.300
life free from the love of money and be content with

703
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.800
what you have.

704
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.000
Be careful.

705
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.500
Love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.

706
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.100
And we've seen what it can do. So be careful.

707
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400
And be content.

708
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.300
But listen, that sounds pretty easy.

709
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.600
It sounds like okay. Yeah, I can try but

710
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.300
we live in this swim in this world of

711
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.500
materialism. How do I not?

712
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.800
It's because the rest of that verse says this.

713
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.900
Keep your life free from the Love of Money be content with what you have why for

714
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.500
God has said I will never leave you nor

715
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.000
forsake you.

716
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.900
That's the key.

717
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.400
That's the key, right?

718
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.900
So we say take an honest look at your life lay everything

719
00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.300
before the Lord let him shift your

720
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.400
heart accordingly around his values live for eternity

721
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.300
not living for today don't walk with any

722
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.800
fear to give up anything. He would call you to right. Don't worry

723
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.300
about laying your life down for him. We use all

724
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.400
that language and we say that it's right and we should but

725
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.300
we look at that and we say how in the world. Can I ever do

726
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:14.400
that?

727
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.400
How can I give up my life? How can I count my

728
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.300
life as nothing for the sake of knowing it? How could I ever

729
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.200
be like that? You can only do that if you

730
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.300
know that he is better that he is with

731
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.900
you and that he's going to take you home someday.

732
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.400
You only can do that when you see him as the treasure

733
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.400
when you see him as the source when you see him

734
00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.400
as better than anything this world can offer and

735
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.400
you see that your life is not the end.

736
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.100
Your death is not the end. Your eternal life is secure.

737
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.900
That wealth does not equal importance death does not equal the

738
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.300
end.

739
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.300
Those don't have the final word.

740
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.400
Your savior has the final word.

741
00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.200
and that life he gives you

742
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.800
Not only starts when you die it starts today.

743
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.400
It starts that moment you trust him eternal

744
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.200
life is ongoing.

745
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.900
and forever

746
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.200
So let's live like it.

747
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.700
Let's allow him.

748
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.600
To show us to shout to us again and

749
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.600
again and again who he is what

750
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.200
he's done.

751
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.400
Let's not forget it. We so quickly walk out

752
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.300
of these doors. We walk away from his word every morning

753
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.300
and we forget it. Don't forget. He's shouting these

754
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.000
truths to us.

755
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.400
Because he's better because he is our

756
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.300
source and because he's taken us home forever with him.

757
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.600
Let's live like that.
