WEBVTT

1
00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:24.145
Well, like I said, we started with the Lord's Supper

2
00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.625
to tangibly remind us of the gospel

3
00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:34.385
and our response to that act of God

4
00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.305
is then a whole life response.

5
00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:42.105
Remember, that's what Romans 12 one says, we looked

6
00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:43.905
to this last week, I appeal to you

7
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:48.305
therefore, by the mercies of God

8
00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:53.055
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy

9
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:57.615
and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

10
00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:04.055
And worship is not just singing, worship is response life.

11
00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:08.135
Here is all of me for all of you.

12
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.015
That's what we're gonna follow up on today.

13
00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.405
That idea of true worship, where we're gonna learn

14
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.605
a more holistic and full response to God's grace

15
00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:22.085
as we study how Hannah responded

16
00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:24.445
to God's grace in her life.

17
00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:29.165
And so we're gonna see that in First Samuel chapter two.

18
00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.565
So take your copy of God's word

19
00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:33.805
and turn there with me again.

20
00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:36.245
We're continuing our series called He Shall Reign.

21
00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:38.205
And we're looking all the way through the book

22
00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:41.645
of First Samuel where this is showing us

23
00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:45.325
how God is the king over all things

24
00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.845
and reminding us of that.

25
00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:50.645
But we first need to remember Hannah's story from last week.

26
00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:55.725
She was the first character really that we saw in this book.

27
00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:58.925
Remember Hannah's story

28
00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.365
because Israel out of slavery in Egypt,

29
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:03.285
now they had settled in land.

30
00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:08.295
God had graciously given them, But as they settled,

31
00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.655
they began to slide morally

32
00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.655
and spiritually things did not go well.

33
00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:15.015
As they landed

34
00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:18.375
and as they drifted away from God, they drifted closer

35
00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:21.975
to self dependence, idolatry,

36
00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:28.195
false religions, Which led then to instability,

37
00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.315
poverty and near constant battles

38
00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:32.555
with other nations around them.

39
00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:36.555
The the Philistines were constantly picking on 'em and

40
00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:40.955
and that was because of the nation drifting away from God.

41
00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:43.875
And Hannah was a miniature of Israel.

42
00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:46.945
She was barren physically.

43
00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:49.905
She could not have children biologically

44
00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.905
yet she was also constantly face to face

45
00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:54.665
with Elena's other wife

46
00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:56.705
who was way more fruitful than she was.

47
00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:59.805
And so there was this battle she was facing daily.

48
00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:04.985
Well, instead of pouting, she prayed.

49
00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:09.855
What we saw was that she prayed with trust and faith

50
00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.825
and humility that God would give her a son

51
00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:14.105
to take away her shame.

52
00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.505
That's what she asked God for.

53
00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.985
But as she did that, we saw a shift in her life

54
00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:21.185
that she prayed with this trust and faith.

55
00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:24.865
But she, something changed in her heart to where she shifted

56
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.425
and became so satisfied

57
00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:29.585
and God himself that she was able, willing to give away

58
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:33.425
that child to him, to let that child serve

59
00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:36.385
for life in the tabernacle.

60
00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:41.425
And she dedicated that son that God had given her Samuel,

61
00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.945
she dedicated him to the Lord's service for life

62
00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:47.745
and left him there to serve.

63
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:53.915
Well, what we're gonna see today is her response as she did

64
00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:57.315
that, what the Bible records, as her response

65
00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:59.555
as she left her son, her three year-old

66
00:03:59.555 --> 00:04:02.235
or so son in the tabernacle.

67
00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:03.995
The one she asked for the cherished one,

68
00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:06.115
she left him at the temple to serve the Lord.

69
00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:09.795
What was her response? How did she respond to the Lord?

70
00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:13.415
Well that's the first 11 verses

71
00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:15.735
that God's word records here in first.

72
00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:17.815
First Samuel chapter two.

73
00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:24.855
As God provided as God met her in the middle of all of this,

74
00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.415
what did she respond with

75
00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:32.605
as she saw God meet the needs she had far

76
00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.245
beyond having a son?

77
00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:35.565
Well how did she respond?

78
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:41.845
Look at verse one down through the first part of verse 11,

79
00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:46.855
one Samuel two and Hannah prayed

80
00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.975
and said, my heart exalts in the Lord.

81
00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:53.895
My horn is exalted in the Lord.

82
00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:56.775
My mouth rides my enemies

83
00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.055
because I rejoice in your salvation.

84
00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:02.695
There is none holy like the Lord.

85
00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:05.175
For there is none besides you.

86
00:05:05.175 --> 00:05:07.735
There is no rock like our God.

87
00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:11.295
Talk no more. So very proudly,

88
00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:13.055
let not arrogance come from your mouth.

89
00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:14.535
For the Lord is a God of knowledge.

90
00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:16.535
And by him actions are weighed.

91
00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:21.535
The bows or the like, the arrows cross bows

92
00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:22.695
of the mighty are broken.

93
00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:27.015
But the feeble bind on strength, those

94
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.135
who were full have hired themselves out for bread.

95
00:05:29.275 --> 00:05:31.655
But those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.

96
00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:34.125
The baron has born seven,

97
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:36.685
but she who has many children is for loin.

98
00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:39.905
The Lord kills and brings to life.

99
00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.225
He brings down to shield the place of the dead

100
00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:44.265
and raises up the Lord.

101
00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:47.665
Makes poor, makes rich, he brings low, he exalts.

102
00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:51.265
He raises up the poor from the dust he lifts the needy from

103
00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:53.385
the ash heap and make them sit with princes

104
00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:56.305
and inherit a seed of honor for the pillars

105
00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:57.645
of the earth are the lords.

106
00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.885
And on them he has set the world.

107
00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:03.375
He will guard the feet of his faithful ones.

108
00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:07.455
But the wicked shall be cut off in darkness for not

109
00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:09.735
by might shall a man prevail.

110
00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:12.785
The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken

111
00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.305
to pieces against them.

112
00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:16.185
He will thunder in heaven.

113
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.945
The Lord will judge the ends of the earth.

114
00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:20.705
He will give strength to his king

115
00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:23.225
and exalt the horn of his anointed.

116
00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:29.415
Then Elna went home to Rama God,

117
00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:32.215
we need you today to see what you want

118
00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:36.735
to show us from this passage that you give us clarity,

119
00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:40.295
give us insight, give us your spiritual eyes to see

120
00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:41.495
what you want us to see.

121
00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:44.535
Challenge us, convict us, encourage us

122
00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:47.855
that you may be glorified.

123
00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.675
That's what we want, God, more than anything, that we

124
00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:54.235
glorify you and you change us in response.

125
00:06:55.785 --> 00:07:00.475
Help us. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

126
00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:05.075
So we're looking at Hannah's responsive worship here

127
00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:09.235
and what we see is a model for really all believers,

128
00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:13.595
how we are to worship the Lord as we pray, as we respond

129
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:14.995
to his grace in our lives.

130
00:07:15.025 --> 00:07:16.875
What do we do? How do we do that?

131
00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.555
That's a great example here.

132
00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:20.755
And first what we learned is

133
00:07:20.755 --> 00:07:23.195
that Hannah's response was focused on the Lord.

134
00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:26.535
That's the first part of this that we understand.

135
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:29.975
Hannah's response was focused on the Lord.

136
00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.975
She was focused on God.

137
00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:37.175
And you saw where her mind was as she prayed this

138
00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:39.015
as she may be even saying this, right?

139
00:07:39.115 --> 00:07:42.015
It was all on God 24 times.

140
00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:46.175
She refers to God either he or God

141
00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:49.335
or a name with nine of those being the name Yahweh.

142
00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:51.295
Like when you're reading your Bible

143
00:07:51.315 --> 00:07:54.055
and you see the word Lord in small capital letters,

144
00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:56.935
it's referring to the name Yahweh,

145
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.215
which was God's covenant name.

146
00:07:58.215 --> 00:08:00.655
He gave to Moses the great I am

147
00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:03.535
self existent one.

148
00:08:03.765 --> 00:08:06.055
This is the name he had specifically

149
00:08:06.055 --> 00:08:07.295
between him and his people.

150
00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:14.545
This was the idea of Hannah's heart being solely focused

151
00:08:14.605 --> 00:08:15.785
on the gracious God.

152
00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:18.425
The one near to her soul over and over and over.

153
00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:20.905
All she says is God does this. God does this.

154
00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:23.825
'cause it's not just the names, right?

155
00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:26.345
She doesn't just say God. She says the names. Yes.

156
00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:30.225
But it was what he does. He weighs actions in judgment.

157
00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:34.225
He shatters the strength of the wicked. He humbles people.

158
00:08:34.325 --> 00:08:36.985
He provides for the barren in the land.

159
00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:38.385
This is what God does.

160
00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:41.665
He's in charge of life, both death and resurrection.

161
00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:44.465
He is in charge of whether someone's poor or rich.

162
00:08:44.655 --> 00:08:47.385
He's in charge of raising people, lowering people.

163
00:08:47.685 --> 00:08:49.545
He also protects his people.

164
00:08:49.765 --> 00:08:52.545
He destroys his people, his enemies like all of it.

165
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:56.045
This is who she's talking to. This is her God.

166
00:08:57.765 --> 00:08:59.505
She can't get this out of her head.

167
00:08:59.575 --> 00:09:01.425
This is theologically astute,

168
00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:04.705
powerful language from a un uneducated woman.

169
00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:11.435
That's why all of that, that's why Hannah prayed verse two,

170
00:09:11.445 --> 00:09:14.115
there is none holy like Yahweh

171
00:09:15.495 --> 00:09:16.915
for there is none besides you.

172
00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:19.395
There is no rock like our God.

173
00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:25.235
What that means is that he is exclusive. He stands alone.

174
00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:29.155
There are no competitors to his throne.

175
00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:32.565
Listen, this is not like some good

176
00:09:32.565 --> 00:09:35.405
and evil battle thing that we often put in movies, right?

177
00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:36.805
This is not something that is like, man,

178
00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:39.245
we hope God wins out in the end 'cause he's strong.

179
00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:40.885
We hope he's strong. We don't really know.

180
00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.605
That's not what this is talking about.

181
00:09:42.655 --> 00:09:43.685
There is none

182
00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:47.725
besides the Lord God Almighty, right?

183
00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:50.125
It's not just that God's like the best option

184
00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:51.325
out of many options.

185
00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:55.955
There's no one else, there is no other God.

186
00:09:56.815 --> 00:09:59.035
He is the only one.

187
00:09:59.035 --> 00:10:00.915
And there's no other, no other rock,

188
00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:04.195
no other foundation on which we can build our lives.

189
00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:10.055
See, again, Hannah is a, a microcosm of Israel.

190
00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:12.735
And so we've been seeing that Israel's been searching

191
00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:16.055
for all kinds of other foundations here

192
00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:18.575
and there for life, for stability,

193
00:10:18.675 --> 00:10:20.575
for security, for prosperity.

194
00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:22.375
They're looking for it all over the place.

195
00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:24.335
What can I build my life on?

196
00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:27.575
And what it had gotten them was destruction and pain

197
00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:28.915
And sorrow.

198
00:10:30.285 --> 00:10:33.985
So what Israel been trying and now they see the results.

199
00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:39.555
Maybe that's where Hannah was before chapter one.

200
00:10:42.195 --> 00:10:45.825
Maybe she, she was longing for the foundation of a son

201
00:10:47.285 --> 00:10:48.865
to take the shame away,

202
00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:51.705
To Secure her future.

203
00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:52.985
Maybe that's where she was.

204
00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:55.705
She was longing for that foundation that

205
00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:56.705
that was gonna fulfill it.

206
00:10:56.725 --> 00:10:58.345
But now at this point, she knew

207
00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:02.305
that only God was gonna be the one who was secure enough,

208
00:11:02.565 --> 00:11:05.545
the rock that she could build her life on the only

209
00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:06.705
true eternal foundation.

210
00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:09.225
It wasn't anything else. It wasn't even a sun

211
00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:13.355
which was secure her future, socially.

212
00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:15.435
It was nothing other than

213
00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:16.575
God.

214
00:11:18.825 --> 00:11:20.215
Maybe that's where you are today,

215
00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:26.585
like we were confronted with last week.

216
00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:29.105
Maybe, maybe you are searching

217
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.185
for fulfillment in all kinds of other ways

218
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:33.845
That This life can

219
00:11:33.845 --> 00:11:34.845
Offer us.

220
00:11:38.805 --> 00:11:41.375
Like are you building your life on the foundation

221
00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:47.075
Of success And the

222
00:11:47.075 --> 00:11:48.115
foundation of pleasure?

223
00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:55.205
Maybe it's of of some kind of athletic ability

224
00:11:55.205 --> 00:11:56.765
that you're building your fam your,

225
00:11:56.765 --> 00:11:58.525
your foundation of your life on.

226
00:11:59.545 --> 00:12:01.685
Or maybe it's family image

227
00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:03.885
and you gotta make sure everybody's doing the right things

228
00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:05.485
or the way it looks to everybody else.

229
00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:07.085
Maybe that's what your foundation is

230
00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:09.125
or maybe it's your talent or whatever else.

231
00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:13.325
Listen to what Jesus said about

232
00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:16.795
that Matthew seven.

233
00:12:18.455 --> 00:12:20.955
He said this verses 24 through 27 students,

234
00:12:20.955 --> 00:12:23.035
you might remember this one from camp, remember, uh,

235
00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:26.315
16 inches of rain and 16 hours and it was flooding

236
00:12:26.415 --> 00:12:27.715
and everything was going crazy.

237
00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:30.155
This is what God led us to.

238
00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:33.115
That next morning Jesus said this, everyone then

239
00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:35.395
who hears these words of mine

240
00:12:35.575 --> 00:12:37.795
and does them will be like a wise man

241
00:12:37.795 --> 00:12:41.675
who built his house on the rock and the rain fell

242
00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:43.635
and the floods came and the winds blew

243
00:12:43.635 --> 00:12:46.235
and beat on that house, but it did not fall.

244
00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:49.395
Why? Because it had been founded on the rock.

245
00:12:51.455 --> 00:12:53.035
But he doesn't stop there. Listen to this.

246
00:12:53.095 --> 00:12:55.475
And everyone who hears these words of mine

247
00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:58.595
and does not do them will be like a foolish man

248
00:12:58.595 --> 00:13:01.995
who built his house on the sand and the rain fell

249
00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:03.595
and the floods came and the winds blew

250
00:13:03.595 --> 00:13:06.515
and beat against that house and it fell

251
00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:09.745
and great was the fall of it.

252
00:13:13.855 --> 00:13:16.315
The same storm is coming for each one of us.

253
00:13:19.025 --> 00:13:21.205
Now that's the storms of life, of course, right?

254
00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:24.685
Just normal everyday storms that come to all of us.

255
00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:27.405
But this is also primarily talking about the storm

256
00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:29.005
of God's judgment at the end.

257
00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:34.605
And, and the question is, where is your foundation?

258
00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:42.825
Where are you building your life today and forever?

259
00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:49.555
There is no rock like our God.

260
00:13:49.555 --> 00:13:54.295
Hannah said, you know why

261
00:13:54.295 --> 00:13:55.375
there's no rock like our God?

262
00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:58.975
Because she says there is none holy like the Lord,

263
00:13:58.975 --> 00:14:01.615
meaning he is set apart, he is unique.

264
00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:03.975
He's the only one. There is no other rock.

265
00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:09.085
It's all sand eternally.

266
00:14:10.395 --> 00:14:14.095
And even today there's no rock like our God.

267
00:14:15.735 --> 00:14:16.755
Hannah understood that.

268
00:14:17.575 --> 00:14:19.355
That's why verse one, she says,

269
00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:22.435
her heart exalted in the Lord.

270
00:14:22.565 --> 00:14:25.955
There was a joy, there was an excitement in him

271
00:14:26.025 --> 00:14:28.515
because of what she now knew was true.

272
00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:33.365
Listen, some of the deepest times of worship come from

273
00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:36.885
whenever we're met in our deepest times of need

274
00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:39.595
by the Lord, right?

275
00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:41.595
It's not just that you come in here feeling all good

276
00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:43.915
and everything's right and all this is perfectly fine

277
00:14:44.015 --> 00:14:45.115
and then I'm worshiping.

278
00:14:45.415 --> 00:14:49.075
No, it's like in the deepest darkest time of need.

279
00:14:49.095 --> 00:14:52.085
That's where God meets us. That's where the worship comes.

280
00:14:55.675 --> 00:14:59.215
Hannah experienced that she felt

281
00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:03.295
and knew his goodness to her in her deepest time of need.

282
00:15:03.555 --> 00:15:05.975
In the midst of maybe not even getting the answer,

283
00:15:06.275 --> 00:15:08.015
she had the joy in him.

284
00:15:11.515 --> 00:15:12.525
Same for us today.

285
00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:17.495
Isn't it true worship,

286
00:15:19.415 --> 00:15:23.215
A joy-filled response to the grace and mercy of God.

287
00:15:23.605 --> 00:15:27.215
True worship means our whole lives

288
00:15:27.795 --> 00:15:29.375
are focused on the Lord.

289
00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:34.805
We just say God, all of me, I It's you've done every, all

290
00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:39.975
of me like as we work, not just in this room, right?

291
00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:44.375
As we work, as we parent, as we play, as we sing,

292
00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:48.175
of course in all of it, we are looking to him

293
00:15:48.435 --> 00:15:50.295
and we're doing it for His glory.

294
00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:57.055
That's why this song was written called The Doxology.

295
00:15:58.685 --> 00:15:59.835
We're gonna sing it together. So

296
00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:00.915
I'm not singing a solo, right?

297
00:16:00.915 --> 00:16:04.435
We're gonna sing this together, but listen to it.

298
00:16:05.895 --> 00:16:09.435
Praise God from whom all

299
00:16:10.225 --> 00:16:11.475
blessings flow.

300
00:16:13.175 --> 00:16:14.315
Praise him.

301
00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:18.555
All preachers here below.

302
00:16:20.655 --> 00:16:23.875
Praise him above the

303
00:16:24.835 --> 00:16:26.275
heavenly hall.

304
00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:30.675
Praise Father, son

305
00:16:31.095 --> 00:16:35.235
and holy sing the amen.

306
00:16:38.705 --> 00:16:43.485
Amen. Hannah was focused on the Lord

307
00:16:44.645 --> 00:16:46.545
to praise him with all that she is

308
00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:51.075
because from him all blessings flow.

309
00:16:52.905 --> 00:16:56.205
But in so doing with that perspective,

310
00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:00.605
she was also humbled before her Lord.

311
00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:05.825
Like she was focused on him, but also humbled before him.

312
00:17:05.965 --> 00:17:07.465
Her response was a humble spirit

313
00:17:07.525 --> 00:17:09.385
before this God that she's focused on

314
00:17:12.275 --> 00:17:16.085
like so much of what she prayed here was an acknowledgement

315
00:17:16.085 --> 00:17:17.245
that God is God

316
00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:21.385
and she's not, that

317
00:17:21.385 --> 00:17:22.545
he does whatever he wants.

318
00:17:22.965 --> 00:17:24.465
So she's humble before him.

319
00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:28.105
There is nothing that she can do compared to him.

320
00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:32.765
Like verse two says, there's none holy like the Lord.

321
00:17:33.055 --> 00:17:36.645
Verse three says, we should be humble before this judge.

322
00:17:36.935 --> 00:17:40.045
Verse four talks about God shattering the strength of those

323
00:17:40.045 --> 00:17:41.325
who claim to be mighty.

324
00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:43.565
It talks a lot about raising and lowering, right?

325
00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:45.125
Flipping these things on its head.

326
00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:47.325
Even the end of verse eight, Hannah, pray this.

327
00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:50.725
For the pillars of the earth are the Lords

328
00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:53.445
and on them he has set the world.

329
00:17:56.305 --> 00:17:59.355
Like just reading that, it reminded me of job's story

330
00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:06.085
like you know, job who questioned God at times

331
00:18:06.595 --> 00:18:09.365
over all the bad things that were happening to him,

332
00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:10.805
which I would too.

333
00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:12.405
I mean honestly, you read the story,

334
00:18:12.435 --> 00:18:13.605
it's like wow, that was hard.

335
00:18:15.715 --> 00:18:19.885
But listen to how God responded to Job.

336
00:18:20.245 --> 00:18:24.685
Whenever he questioned God about what was happening to him,

337
00:18:25.345 --> 00:18:26.845
listen to God's response.

338
00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:31.185
Job 38, where were you? This is God talking.

339
00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:34.585
Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?

340
00:18:35.965 --> 00:18:37.295
Tell me if you have understanding

341
00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:40.375
who determined its measurements, surely you know,

342
00:18:40.435 --> 00:18:42.575
or who stretched the line upon it on

343
00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:47.575
what were its bases sunk who laid its cornerstone

344
00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:51.895
like and God goes on like that for two whole chapters.

345
00:18:51.895 --> 00:18:54.415
And then he gets to this. This is Job 40.

346
00:18:54.665 --> 00:18:59.655
Verse two, shall a fault finder contend with the Almighty.

347
00:19:01.035 --> 00:19:02.855
He who argues with God let him answer it.

348
00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:10.405
I read this from Trevon Wax said, if there is a God

349
00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:12.125
and he really did make you

350
00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:14.805
and the rest of the world, then you don't get

351
00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:16.845
to define him in relation to you.

352
00:19:17.545 --> 00:19:19.645
He gets to define you in relation to him.

353
00:19:22.885 --> 00:19:24.945
We don't understand it all, but we try to make him.

354
00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:28.305
We pull him down and fit into our system.

355
00:19:28.525 --> 00:19:31.025
Or we could just say, no, no, no. He defines us.

356
00:19:33.315 --> 00:19:37.215
He is in control. That was Hannah's perspective, right?

357
00:19:39.585 --> 00:19:42.275
Like think about the way she would've originally

358
00:19:43.035 --> 00:19:45.555
designed her life to be was to have a bunch of babies

359
00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:49.675
to be fruitful and multiply, to have standing in society.

360
00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:51.595
That would've been what she would've done.

361
00:19:51.615 --> 00:19:52.795
That's security, right?

362
00:19:52.935 --> 00:19:54.475
She would've designed her life that way,

363
00:19:54.815 --> 00:19:56.955
but God had a different plan for her life.

364
00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:59.515
He had a better plan for her life,

365
00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.715
but it demanded her humility

366
00:20:01.855 --> 00:20:03.515
before him to be able to be a part of it.

367
00:20:05.685 --> 00:20:08.105
She had to say, okay, God, I don't understand

368
00:20:08.105 --> 00:20:10.025
how this is working out, but I'm gonna trust you,

369
00:20:10.805 --> 00:20:11.865
humble before you.

370
00:20:12.255 --> 00:20:15.745
It's not my plan, but I'm going to trust your plan.

371
00:20:18.475 --> 00:20:23.135
Israel was similar. Israel had been walking in proud

372
00:20:23.165 --> 00:20:24.655
arrogance against Yahweh.

373
00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:26.215
They'd been doing it their own way,

374
00:20:26.215 --> 00:20:29.175
living lick wicked lives thinking that by might

375
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.215
and strength they're gonna overcome it

376
00:20:31.315 --> 00:20:33.335
and they can figure it out and make it happen.

377
00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:38.975
What they needed to remember was that it was God

378
00:20:39.195 --> 00:20:41.335
who delivered them from Egypt to begin with.

379
00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:44.335
It was God who provided for them in the desert.

380
00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:47.525
It was God who brought them into their land.

381
00:20:47.585 --> 00:20:50.285
It was God who reigned over them in the land.

382
00:20:50.385 --> 00:20:51.685
It was all God.

383
00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:53.525
And they needed to be humble before him

384
00:20:53.525 --> 00:20:55.525
because what he was doing was setting new

385
00:20:55.555 --> 00:20:57.125
pillars in society.

386
00:20:57.275 --> 00:20:58.965
They had to recognize that

387
00:20:58.965 --> 00:21:02.985
and say, no, no, God, you're the king and this is your plan.

388
00:21:02.985 --> 00:21:04.105
This is how you're going to do it.

389
00:21:07.405 --> 00:21:09.625
Uh, maybe that's something we all need to be reminded

390
00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:13.275
of today that that we

391
00:21:14.495 --> 00:21:17.995
are not really as in control as we think we are.

392
00:21:20.305 --> 00:21:25.135
Like we talk a big game. We, we think we have control.

393
00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:27.725
We think we're strong.

394
00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:32.605
But what we need to be instead

395
00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:35.685
is humble before the Lord.

396
00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:40.885
We need to be humble before the one who judges, the one who

397
00:21:41.615 --> 00:21:44.325
lifts up the weak, the one who ordains life

398
00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:47.005
and death, the one who cuts off the wicked, the one

399
00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:48.525
who destroys his enemies.

400
00:21:48.525 --> 00:21:50.765
We need to be humble before him.

401
00:21:53.795 --> 00:21:57.175
We play God so often and he's like, no, no, I'm God.

402
00:21:57.175 --> 00:22:01.635
You're not. And so be humble before him. He is all of that.

403
00:22:01.635 --> 00:22:04.275
But not only that, think about the gospel

404
00:22:04.775 --> 00:22:05.915
and be humbled before him.

405
00:22:09.785 --> 00:22:11.825
I, I've, I've said this before, I believe it.

406
00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:16.305
Christians should be the most humble people on the planet.

407
00:22:19.445 --> 00:22:21.835
There should be no pride, no arrogance.

408
00:22:21.935 --> 00:22:23.395
We should run away from it.

409
00:22:23.415 --> 00:22:26.195
We should be the most humble people on the planet.

410
00:22:26.695 --> 00:22:29.555
Not just because Jesus was and

411
00:22:29.555 --> 00:22:32.035
because he commanded it of his followers.

412
00:22:32.945 --> 00:22:37.235
This is what, because this whole thing is not

413
00:22:37.235 --> 00:22:38.275
based on our abilities.

414
00:22:40.515 --> 00:22:43.045
Like the only thing we bring

415
00:22:43.145 --> 00:22:46.405
to the table is our sin, our failure.

416
00:22:48.665 --> 00:22:50.835
Like that's what we're offering in this deal here.

417
00:22:50.835 --> 00:22:52.555
Like well, we've got our sin and our

418
00:22:52.555 --> 00:22:54.635
and we're gonna plop it on the table like we got something

419
00:22:54.635 --> 00:22:55.635
to be proud of in this.

420
00:22:56.965 --> 00:22:58.905
We just bring our mess, we bring our failure.

421
00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:02.865
It is God who justifies. It is God who redeems.

422
00:23:03.085 --> 00:23:06.665
Our salvation is only through the perfect life.

423
00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:10.745
Jesus lived that we could not live his substitutionary death

424
00:23:11.005 --> 00:23:13.185
in our place for our sin,

425
00:23:13.365 --> 00:23:16.625
his victorious resurrection over sin and over death.

426
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:17.785
We could never do it ourselves.

427
00:23:18.085 --> 00:23:19.665
That's what he brings to the table.

428
00:23:20.045 --> 00:23:22.145
We bring our junk that he paid for.

429
00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:26.685
See why we should be humble.

430
00:23:29.955 --> 00:23:31.445
Like I love how Ephesians two

431
00:23:32.595 --> 00:23:37.195
says it for by grace.

432
00:23:38.035 --> 00:23:39.675
Remember grace is a gift for

433
00:23:39.695 --> 00:23:42.395
by grace you have been saved through faith.

434
00:23:42.495 --> 00:23:44.275
And this is not your own doing.

435
00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:47.845
It is the gift of God.

436
00:23:47.845 --> 00:23:49.285
You don't earn a gift,

437
00:23:52.585 --> 00:23:56.845
not a result of works so that no one may boast.

438
00:24:00.865 --> 00:24:03.965
The only thing we boast about is our weakness.

439
00:24:06.205 --> 00:24:09.385
We we boast in Christ.

440
00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:11.985
That's what two Corinthians 12 says,

441
00:24:11.985 --> 00:24:13.385
like boast about my weakness.

442
00:24:13.545 --> 00:24:15.945
I bring nothing to the table except my failure.

443
00:24:16.325 --> 00:24:19.345
And that is good news because then he paid it all for me.

444
00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:21.385
He did it all for him. We boast in Christ.

445
00:24:21.605 --> 00:24:24.585
He did it all for us, which then should lead us to worship,

446
00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:28.665
which is what verse one says, my heart exalts in the Lord.

447
00:24:29.105 --> 00:24:32.145
I rejoice in your salvation. That's why.

448
00:24:32.975 --> 00:24:35.745
Because she realizes she brought nothing to the table.

449
00:24:36.015 --> 00:24:37.945
This was all God doing.

450
00:24:41.455 --> 00:24:45.435
She was barren. She couldn't produce a baby.

451
00:24:46.455 --> 00:24:48.475
In fact, God had to

452
00:24:49.475 --> 00:24:51.555
miraculously give a baby.

453
00:24:52.675 --> 00:24:56.455
Is that not the same way we have barrenness in our lives.

454
00:24:56.595 --> 00:25:00.015
We have a mess. We cannot produce anything spiritually.

455
00:25:00.115 --> 00:25:01.455
God has to do it for us.

456
00:25:04.175 --> 00:25:06.515
So, so are you excited about the gospel?

457
00:25:08.445 --> 00:25:11.345
Like are you stunned?

458
00:25:13.855 --> 00:25:17.915
Am I excited over the grace of God of what he's done for me?

459
00:25:18.455 --> 00:25:21.035
Am I living then a whole life response

460
00:25:21.035 --> 00:25:24.915
because of all that he's done where Hannah says,

461
00:25:25.015 --> 00:25:26.035
you gave me this child.

462
00:25:26.215 --> 00:25:29.795
I'm giving it back to you. God, you gave me everything.

463
00:25:30.055 --> 00:25:32.155
You gave me salvation, you gave me every talent,

464
00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.755
every ability I have, every resource, every history I have.

465
00:25:34.775 --> 00:25:37.555
You've given it all to me. So I'm giving it all back to you.

466
00:25:38.655 --> 00:25:40.195
Is that how we respond to him?

467
00:25:43.105 --> 00:25:44.445
Hannah was humbled

468
00:25:44.445 --> 00:25:46.845
before the Lord as she responded

469
00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:48.245
to his goodness in her life.

470
00:25:48.425 --> 00:25:50.485
She said, okay, God, I'm all yours.

471
00:25:51.785 --> 00:25:54.125
That's what we need to be as well.

472
00:25:57.995 --> 00:26:00.495
Yet there's also something else about her response here.

473
00:26:02.365 --> 00:26:04.945
She wasn't just humbled, she wasn't just focused.

474
00:26:05.005 --> 00:26:07.225
She was expectant of the Lord

475
00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:11.385
in her prayer, in her worship.

476
00:26:11.805 --> 00:26:14.825
She was expectant of the Lord.

477
00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:21.985
Remember, things were not great in Israel.

478
00:26:24.255 --> 00:26:28.835
Idolatry, abuse, selfishness that was

479
00:26:30.185 --> 00:26:33.695
rampant as they drifted away from the Lord.

480
00:26:33.755 --> 00:26:36.015
But look at the language. Hannah sings here.

481
00:26:37.415 --> 00:26:39.445
She'd seen God's goodness in her life.

482
00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:41.685
Look at what she prays.

483
00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:45.285
Verse three, God knows even all that's hidden

484
00:26:45.545 --> 00:26:47.205
and he's gonna judge accordingly.

485
00:26:47.635 --> 00:26:49.765
What that means is the wicked aren't gonna get away with it.

486
00:26:51.965 --> 00:26:53.855
Like she's looking at Eli and his sons over here.

487
00:26:53.855 --> 00:26:56.215
We'll see this next week. All the priests were wicked.

488
00:26:56.345 --> 00:26:58.215
She's like, God, you gotta do something with that.

489
00:26:58.215 --> 00:27:01.085
And I know you will. Verse four,

490
00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:03.325
not only does God humble those who think they're strong,

491
00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:06.885
it says the feeble bind on strength.

492
00:27:06.915 --> 00:27:09.805
What it means is that God strengthens the weak.

493
00:27:12.785 --> 00:27:16.155
Like he, he fits onto the weak

494
00:27:16.795 --> 00:27:18.075
strength like armor.

495
00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.835
Verse five talks about how God will provide

496
00:27:21.835 --> 00:27:23.635
for the hungry flip on its head.

497
00:27:23.695 --> 00:27:26.395
The social status structure based on being barren

498
00:27:26.535 --> 00:27:28.435
or fruitful like that won't matter anymore

499
00:27:28.435 --> 00:27:29.915
because it's about what God does.

500
00:27:32.475 --> 00:27:34.695
And then just look at the upheaval in society.

501
00:27:34.745 --> 00:27:37.015
God's work does here. Look at verses seven and eight.

502
00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:42.135
The Lord makes poor, makes rich, he brings low, he exalts.

503
00:27:42.155 --> 00:27:45.775
He raises up the poor from the dust he lifts the needy from

504
00:27:45.775 --> 00:27:48.095
the as sheep to make them sit with princes

505
00:27:48.355 --> 00:27:50.375
and inherit a seat of honor.

506
00:27:50.375 --> 00:27:53.295
Right? That's an expectation. God's gonna work right?

507
00:27:55.275 --> 00:27:56.895
And he's gonna come through for the week.

508
00:27:57.045 --> 00:27:58.775
He's gonna make sure that everything is

509
00:27:58.775 --> 00:27:59.895
taken care of as it should be.

510
00:28:02.005 --> 00:28:03.535
Even more judgment. Verses nine

511
00:28:03.535 --> 00:28:05.055
and 10, God protects his people.

512
00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:08.215
He shatters those who stand opposed to him.

513
00:28:08.635 --> 00:28:11.855
See, just like Israel should have been alert to,

514
00:28:13.315 --> 00:28:17.955
Hannah was looking around at all the desecration

515
00:28:18.055 --> 00:28:20.955
of society and instead of getting depressed about it,

516
00:28:21.175 --> 00:28:23.715
she was actually hopeful about it.

517
00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:31.585
'cause she knew that God is the Lord Almighty.

518
00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:34.505
He is the holy one. He is the judge.

519
00:28:34.715 --> 00:28:35.945
He'll make all things right.

520
00:28:36.155 --> 00:28:39.065
He'll bring things back into order as it should be.

521
00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:40.785
She knew that's who God was.

522
00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:43.745
And we'll see specifically the end of verse 10.

523
00:28:43.745 --> 00:28:47.755
Look at the back half of verse 10 says, the Lord

524
00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:50.715
will judge the ends of the earth.

525
00:28:52.305 --> 00:28:54.245
He will give strength to his king

526
00:28:54.585 --> 00:28:57.685
and exalt the horn of his anointed.

527
00:29:00.045 --> 00:29:01.105
Now let's wait a second here.

528
00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:05.175
'cause they don't have a king yet.

529
00:29:07.135 --> 00:29:11.795
No one has been anointed yet. Samuel's still a baby.

530
00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:14.835
He's going to be the one to anoint the king,

531
00:29:14.935 --> 00:29:16.595
but they don't have one yet.

532
00:29:16.595 --> 00:29:17.635
So what's she talking about?

533
00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:21.735
Well, I believe this is a prophecy

534
00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:24.495
that has a dual fulfillment.

535
00:29:27.345 --> 00:29:31.555
There's a future king coming that will be all

536
00:29:31.555 --> 00:29:33.115
that she just prayed right here.

537
00:29:36.595 --> 00:29:37.565
Because here's what's

538
00:29:37.645 --> 00:29:38.765
interesting about this prayer from Hannah.

539
00:29:39.795 --> 00:29:41.525
It's not the only time we see it, it in scripture.

540
00:29:44.435 --> 00:29:47.125
It's not exactly repeated in other

541
00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:48.445
places, but it's very similar.

542
00:29:48.545 --> 00:29:51.045
And anytime you see something repeated in scripture,

543
00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:52.325
that means it's important.

544
00:29:53.865 --> 00:29:55.525
So when you see the same themes over

545
00:29:55.525 --> 00:29:56.845
and over again, you're like, whoa, I need

546
00:29:56.845 --> 00:29:58.645
to zero in on that.

547
00:29:58.705 --> 00:29:59.965
And one of those times

548
00:29:59.995 --> 00:30:03.485
that is actually almost repeated is at the very end

549
00:30:03.585 --> 00:30:07.765
of Second Samuel, a book end to one was once,

550
00:30:08.105 --> 00:30:09.325
one book, by the way, first

551
00:30:09.325 --> 00:30:10.725
and second Samuel, we've split it up.

552
00:30:10.725 --> 00:30:12.205
It was actually one to begin with.

553
00:30:14.735 --> 00:30:16.025
They were combined together.

554
00:30:16.085 --> 00:30:19.425
And so this was the beginning of first Samuel to us.

555
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:22.385
But at the very end of second Samuel, second Samuel,

556
00:30:22.495 --> 00:30:27.385
chapter 22, king David at this time, he prays a lot

557
00:30:27.485 --> 00:30:29.625
of what Hannah just prayed.

558
00:30:33.805 --> 00:30:35.285
I want you to read the whole thing later.

559
00:30:36.565 --> 00:30:40.225
Go to Second Samuel 22 later today. Read all of it.

560
00:30:40.295 --> 00:30:44.065
It's powerful. But look at, just listen to verses 22, uh,

561
00:30:44.215 --> 00:30:46.105
chapter 22 verses two and three.

562
00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:47.385
This is David's prayer.

563
00:30:48.895 --> 00:30:53.535
He said, the Lord is my rock and my fortress

564
00:30:53.555 --> 00:30:57.575
and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I take refuge

565
00:30:58.235 --> 00:31:03.175
my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold,

566
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:06.815
my refuge, my savior, you save me from violence.

567
00:31:08.715 --> 00:31:10.455
That's already familiar.

568
00:31:10.475 --> 00:31:12.735
And then you see throughout his prayer things

569
00:31:12.735 --> 00:31:14.055
like God thundering.

570
00:31:14.075 --> 00:31:16.055
We saw that before. Rescuing his people,

571
00:31:16.145 --> 00:31:17.335
shattering his enemies.

572
00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:21.295
His way is perfect. He's a refuge for his people.

573
00:31:21.645 --> 00:31:26.575
Then this down in verse 32, for who is God but the Lord

574
00:31:27.835 --> 00:31:29.895
and who is a rock except our God.

575
00:31:31.975 --> 00:31:33.595
Now that sounds familiar, doesn't it?

576
00:31:34.945 --> 00:31:37.765
That's exactly what Hannah just prayed.

577
00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:40.045
Then think about this, the very last verse.

578
00:31:40.295 --> 00:31:43.325
Great salvation he brings to his king

579
00:31:43.625 --> 00:31:47.205
and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David

580
00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:48.845
and his offspring forever.

581
00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:55.065
That's what Hannah saw as she looked ahead in her prayer,

582
00:31:55.065 --> 00:31:58.815
right strength to his king, to his anointed.

583
00:31:58.915 --> 00:32:02.015
She, she saw it before it happened.

584
00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:05.335
David experienced Israel's greatest king.

585
00:32:05.355 --> 00:32:07.735
He experienced this anointing. He was saved.

586
00:32:07.755 --> 00:32:10.535
He was strengthened by the Lord God almighty. He knew it.

587
00:32:10.805 --> 00:32:13.855
This is the bookend of one and two Samuel.

588
00:32:15.985 --> 00:32:19.825
But he gets even better because about a thousand years later

589
00:32:22.365 --> 00:32:25.395
there was another impossible pregnancy.

590
00:32:27.215 --> 00:32:30.525
There was another bringing of a baby to the temple

591
00:32:30.665 --> 00:32:32.965
to dedicate it to the Lord.

592
00:32:34.065 --> 00:32:38.625
There was another calling of a baby

593
00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:39.885
to be be something great

594
00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:47.845
and involves Mary the Virgin mother of Jesus,

595
00:32:50.065 --> 00:32:54.085
who prayed a very similar prayer to

596
00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:56.245
what Hannah prayed.

597
00:32:58.645 --> 00:33:02.325
'cause Mary had to believe God's plan

598
00:33:04.395 --> 00:33:09.005
and this is how she prayed in response as she believed it.

599
00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:13.145
Luke one Mary said, my soul magnifies the Lord.

600
00:33:13.405 --> 00:33:15.585
My spirit rejoices in God, my savior,

601
00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:18.825
for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.

602
00:33:19.135 --> 00:33:20.985
From behold, from now on,

603
00:33:21.245 --> 00:33:22.905
all generations will call me blessed.

604
00:33:22.965 --> 00:33:25.825
For he who is mighty has done great things for me.

605
00:33:26.295 --> 00:33:28.025
Holy is his name.

606
00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:30.105
His mercy is for those

607
00:33:30.105 --> 00:33:32.025
who fear him from generation to generation.

608
00:33:32.295 --> 00:33:33.905
He's shown strength with his arm.

609
00:33:34.205 --> 00:33:37.385
He has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.

610
00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:39.985
He's brought down the mighty from their thrones,

611
00:33:40.495 --> 00:33:42.305
exalted those of humble estate.

612
00:33:42.735 --> 00:33:44.785
He's filled the hungry with good things.

613
00:33:45.205 --> 00:33:47.025
The rich, he sent away empty.

614
00:33:47.335 --> 00:33:48.865
He's helped his servant Israel.

615
00:33:49.045 --> 00:33:51.585
In remembrance of his mercies, he spoke to our fathers,

616
00:33:51.645 --> 00:33:53.585
to Abraham in his offspring forever,

617
00:33:57.485 --> 00:34:00.665
almost exact you tie that then with

618
00:34:01.225 --> 00:34:04.145
zechariah's prophecy at nearly exactly the same time

619
00:34:04.395 --> 00:34:06.585
where Zechariah about John the Baptist

620
00:34:07.005 --> 00:34:08.145
was talking about Jesus.

621
00:34:08.455 --> 00:34:12.585
That Jesus was sent to raise up a horn of salvation

622
00:34:12.615 --> 00:34:14.225
through David.

623
00:34:18.245 --> 00:34:20.615
Like all this links together, doesn't it?

624
00:34:23.055 --> 00:34:25.915
But we can see then is what Hannah prayed

625
00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:28.975
in chapter two of one Samuel.

626
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:32.415
What she prayed in light of God's redemption

627
00:34:32.835 --> 00:34:37.575
and his grace, what she prayed could only be fulfilled

628
00:34:37.795 --> 00:34:38.895
by Messiah,

629
00:34:41.155 --> 00:34:43.655
by God the king himself.

630
00:34:46.195 --> 00:34:47.695
God would do it in certain ways,

631
00:34:48.035 --> 00:34:50.095
but Hannah could not look

632
00:34:50.195 --> 00:34:53.815
for fulfillment in anything tangible here in this earth.

633
00:34:55.895 --> 00:34:56.915
It was only in God.

634
00:34:57.135 --> 00:35:00.915
Israel itself could not look for safety and stability

635
00:35:01.095 --> 00:35:05.595
and prosperity in a false God or even in an earthly king.

636
00:35:05.775 --> 00:35:06.995
It was only in God.

637
00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:13.975
We today, we cannot imagine that a leader

638
00:35:14.235 --> 00:35:15.415
or a political party

639
00:35:15.635 --> 00:35:18.095
or a government of any sort will provide

640
00:35:18.285 --> 00:35:20.695
what our souls deeply long for.

641
00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.175
It's only found in God.

642
00:35:24.905 --> 00:35:28.605
It only comes in God alone. How do we get that?

643
00:35:28.785 --> 00:35:32.845
How do we find that? It comes as we focus our hearts

644
00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:35.855
and our lives on him

645
00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:38.565
and his kingdom that surpasses all others.

646
00:35:39.865 --> 00:35:44.165
It comes as we humble ourselves before the King of kings

647
00:35:44.225 --> 00:35:46.765
and the Lord of Lords it.

648
00:35:46.785 --> 00:35:50.605
It comes as we worship expectantly

649
00:35:51.955 --> 00:35:55.885
that all that we long for all the things that we want

650
00:35:56.225 --> 00:35:59.645
and know that justice needs to bring all those things

651
00:35:59.835 --> 00:36:03.685
that it is coming in him, not in anything else,

652
00:36:03.915 --> 00:36:07.805
that he is the solid rock that we can build our lives on.

653
00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:12.405
That's what we find in God alone.
