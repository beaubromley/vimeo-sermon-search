1
00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:00.545
All right.

2
00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:03.265
Good morning. No, not good morning, good evening.

3
00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:05.785
If that tells you anything about how my day's gone today.

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.225
So good evening. That's right, yes.

5
00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:15.505
Um, it's been a hard week for me. Physically.

6
00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:19.585
My knee is really, really sore, so that's draining

7
00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:21.705
physically as well.

8
00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:25.305
But, uh, anyway, that's neither here nor there,

9
00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:26.865
but it is just reality.

10
00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.145
We're a family. So that's where I'm at right now.

11
00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:34.385
So we're here tonight to dig deeper into this idea of God,

12
00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:35.865
the Son, the incarnation.

13
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.705
We could do a sermon each over the next couple weeks about

14
00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.185
the father, the son, the Spirit.

15
00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:43.345
We could have taken the Trinity

16
00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:46.465
and then taken the three persons and the one God,

17
00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.025
and then explain that a little bit.

18
00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:51.825
But one of the reasons we picked just doing God the Son, is

19
00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:53.185
because first we love to talk about Jesus.

20
00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:54.345
That's always fun.

21
00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:58.425
But, but also because those, those are the two, the Trinity

22
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.945
and God the Son, are the two biggest heresy drivers

23
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:05.345
in the history of the church.

24
00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.465
So thought, let's answer some of those questions.

25
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:12.105
Try to get some good framework, how to speak well

26
00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:15.505
of the Trinity, how to speak well of the incarnation.

27
00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:18.545
So they're hard. Like we've said, these are mysteries,

28
00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:21.785
but that also means we can learn to speak well

29
00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:23.545
of these things and how we can grow

30
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.345
into a deeper understanding.

31
00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:29.185
So just as a way of review from Sunday,

32
00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:33.785
we looked at John one, just walked through the whole,

33
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.025
really, almost the whole chapter of John one,

34
00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:39.425
looking at the word, the Son Christ,

35
00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:43.865
and how there's this line that traced through, uh, eternally

36
00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.425
from this, this word idea,

37
00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:49.905
which we'll talk a little bit about that later.

38
00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:54.745
But, but this word idea then gets identified

39
00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:57.585
as the son, the second person of the Trinity,

40
00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:02.625
which then we meet in the incarnation as Jesus Christ.

41
00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:07.265
So that was the track of John one giving us a picture of,

42
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:11.145
yes, this is the same person of the Trinity,

43
00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:13.825
but it's, it's identify.

44
00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:17.145
You can see this relationship throughout with the word

45
00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:19.265
and God and the Spirit.

46
00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:21.345
And then you can see God the Father, God the Son,

47
00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.745
God the Spirit in the Trinity.

48
00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:25.545
And then you can see the Father, Jesus Christ

49
00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:29.105
and His Holy Spirit in this kind of next level.

50
00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:31.505
So that was the progression we followed.

51
00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:34.785
We saw that he's the creator, the Savior.

52
00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:39.065
We saw that, uh, in him was life, that

53
00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:42.025
John was merely a reflection of the light.

54
00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.065
But then we saw he's not only creator

55
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:49.905
and savior, which kind of that idea of the word move to this

56
00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:53.745
idea of the word taking on flesh, John one 14,

57
00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:57.185
and becoming this what we know.

58
00:02:57.215 --> 00:02:58.585
Then the, the sun.

59
00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:00.285
And you see that referred

60
00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.805
to even in the Old Testament, the son of man.

61
00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:05.165
Uh, you can see that as, as reference

62
00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:07.085
to this second person of the trinity.

63
00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:12.285
Now, that's where the, the heresies pop up is

64
00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:15.325
whenever we figure out, okay, how did God the Son take on

65
00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:16.885
flesh, not lose anything.

66
00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:19.045
We'll talk a lot more about this later,

67
00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:23.565
but this is where we get to the two natures in one person.

68
00:03:24.585 --> 00:03:28.725
Uh, this two, both human and divine nature.

69
00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:33.645
In one person, that's the hypostatic union.

70
00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.365
That hypostatic word comes from the Greek word,

71
00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:39.605
which which means merged in a way.

72
00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:41.605
You could say it that way, two in one.

73
00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:43.845
But we can't think purely merged

74
00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:46.565
because it, it's, they're still distinct.

75
00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:49.205
That was one of the heresies that we saw was

76
00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.285
that those two just merged together and became one

77
00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:52.845
or blended together

78
00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:55.085
and create a third or anything like that.

79
00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:56.285
No, there's still the divine nature

80
00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:59.205
and the human nature, uh, the divine will, the human will

81
00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.125
in one person, but again, not competing.

82
00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:08.525
The human nature of Jesus was, was fully submissive

83
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:12.285
to the divine nature, the divine will of God.

84
00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:16.005
Uh, the Godhead, again, mystery.

85
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:19.245
So a couple of heresies we saw, I mentioned a few there.

86
00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:21.885
Jesus only appeared to be human like he was a ghost.

87
00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:24.205
Uh, his true humanity is denied,

88
00:04:24.205 --> 00:04:25.445
which means he couldn't die for us.

89
00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.845
Uh, some will say Jesus was created by God.

90
00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:30.405
I've said this the last couple times, still alive

91
00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:32.245
and well, counterfeit Christianity like

92
00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:33.525
Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses.

93
00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:35.325
There's this idea of Jesus was created.

94
00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:37.165
Uh, he's unique, he's special,

95
00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:39.005
but he was created well,

96
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:41.525
that makes him lesser than God the Father.

97
00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:42.965
That's not biblical.

98
00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:48.525
Uh, two persons, that's schizophrenia, uh, again, blended

99
00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:50.045
or that he only one nature.

100
00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:51.925
And these were interesting. I

101
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.005
kind of ran by these pretty quickly.

102
00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:56.605
Some would say that, that God, the Son

103
00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:02.225
overtook a baby that was already existing in Mary's womb,

104
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:03.985
and Joseph and Mary actually

105
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:05.585
conceived a baby and Mary's womb.

106
00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:08.665
And, and almost instantly, God, the son overtook that baby.

107
00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:10.545
I don't know where they get that,

108
00:05:10.565 --> 00:05:11.705
but that's what they would say.

109
00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:13.505
That it, it took that form

110
00:05:13.725 --> 00:05:15.665
or even further in that,

111
00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:17.985
that there was some random guy named Jesus

112
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.225
walking around Galilee.

113
00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:21.505
And the Holy Spirit

114
00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.945
instilled God the Son on this man and overtook him there.

115
00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:28.505
That's legitimate. People believe that.

116
00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:31.425
Whether it's true or not, of course, we would say no.

117
00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:35.145
Or there's that third one where at the baptism,

118
00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:38.825
which this is where they go back to where the Father speaks,

119
00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.785
this is my beloved son, with whom I'm well pleased.

120
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:44.425
And the Holy Spirit floats down like a dove.

121
00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:48.185
They say, when the father says, this is my beloved son,

122
00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:49.185
that's an identification.

123
00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:51.145
In that moment, he becomes the son of God.

124
00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:55.305
So you can see how we're trying to wrap our minds

125
00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:56.585
around this idea of the incarnation.

126
00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:58.765
We just, it's, it's a mystery. Yes.

127
00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:02.125
But we can't find those things biblically.

128
00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:03.965
We have to come back to the authority

129
00:06:03.965 --> 00:06:05.405
of God's word as our source.

130
00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:09.805
But what I wanna talk about a lot more tonight

131
00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:13.765
and get into some, some extra notes that I have, uh,

132
00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:15.325
this idea of kenosis.

133
00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:17.565
So Philippians two,

134
00:06:18.205 --> 00:06:21.565
I mentioned this on Sunday when you talk about Philippians

135
00:06:21.565 --> 00:06:24.965
two, and you could look it up, uh, it's in there, uh, verses

136
00:06:25.555 --> 00:06:27.245
kind of four through nine ish.

137
00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:30.045
There, it talks about Jesus,

138
00:06:30.105 --> 00:06:31.365
and it talks about the society of humility.

139
00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.245
And he's, he's, Paul is writing

140
00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:35.285
to the church in Philippi saying, you need

141
00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:36.925
to have this same mind in yourselves.

142
00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:38.405
You need to, you need to be humble

143
00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:41.085
and treat each other like that.

144
00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:45.125
And he gives the reason, the reason have this mind

145
00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:47.445
among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.

146
00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:51.685
What you already have in Christ is this kind of mind.

147
00:06:51.685 --> 00:06:55.245
And here is what he says about that kind of mind.

148
00:06:56.195 --> 00:07:00.725
It's Philippians two, and he says it this way.

149
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.045
This is talking about Christ Jesus,

150
00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:12.125
who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality

151
00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:14.245
with God a thing to be grasped.

152
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:19.405
Maybe another word would, would be like held onto clung to,

153
00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:23.365
uh, one of the footnotes says a thing

154
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:24.965
to be held onto for advantage.

155
00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:29.685
So he didn't consider equality with God a thing

156
00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:33.925
to be grasped, held onto for an advantage, willing

157
00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:35.925
to let it go in a sense.

158
00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:40.605
But he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant,

159
00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:42.325
being born in the likeness of men.

160
00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:45.365
Now, we often stop there. We're talking about humility

161
00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.565
because that's where we should, but,

162
00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:49.325
but notice it doesn't stop there.

163
00:07:49.365 --> 00:07:51.645
I wanna read this, we'll not really touch on this,

164
00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:53.925
but verse eight, being found in human form.

165
00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:56.085
He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point

166
00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:57.245
of death, even death on a cross.

167
00:07:57.265 --> 00:07:59.845
So he even got lower than just becoming like us.

168
00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:02.445
He actually died for us.

169
00:08:02.595 --> 00:08:03.965
Then verse nine, therefore,

170
00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:08.165
because of this, you almost think the image of a, a slope,

171
00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.525
just thinking skiing, I guess, but,

172
00:08:10.665 --> 00:08:14.365
but a slope downward where he's, he's walking this road

173
00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:18.405
of humility of, of the throne of God down to humanity,

174
00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:20.805
even down to death on the cross.

175
00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:23.965
But then verse nine, therefore,

176
00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:26.725
because of that, then you think the upward track,

177
00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:27.845
as you're going up the chairlift,

178
00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:31.925
God has highly exalted him, bestowed on him the name that is

179
00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:33.885
above every name, so that the name of Jesus,

180
00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:35.565
every knee should bow in heaven

181
00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:36.765
and on earth and under the earth.

182
00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:39.165
And every tongue confessed Jesus Christ is Lord

183
00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:40.245
to the glory of God the Father.

184
00:08:40.465 --> 00:08:43.245
So he's gone right back to where he was to begin with.

185
00:08:44.675 --> 00:08:47.925
It's down in humility, but then upward in exaltation

186
00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:51.525
because of his humility leading to death and resurrection.

187
00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:55.405
But the question comes in that verse where he says,

188
00:08:56.425 --> 00:08:58.445
though he was in the form, this is verse six,

189
00:08:58.445 --> 00:09:01.285
though he was in the form of God, did not count equality

190
00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:04.685
with God a thing to be grasped.

191
00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:08.845
Now, hard, I get it. But that's called the kenosis theory.

192
00:09:08.865 --> 00:09:11.245
And a lot of us in church history have gotten

193
00:09:11.275 --> 00:09:16.005
that a little bit wrong in a sense that we, we tend to say

194
00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:19.005
that, that in a way that makes,

195
00:09:19.335 --> 00:09:21.525
makes him have lost godness.

196
00:09:22.835 --> 00:09:27.245
That he, he set his godness aside to become like us.

197
00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:32.965
So let's just walk through those verses for a second.

198
00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:38.125
Verse six. You have this pre-existent Christ, right?

199
00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:40.165
You see that he was in the form of God.

200
00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:44.365
So pre-existent Christ before incarnation the form of God.

201
00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:47.525
We could go back to the word to the Son from John one,

202
00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:53.225
that then the next phrase that he defines as equality

203
00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.265
with God, right?

204
00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:57.065
So there's an equality between the son and the Father.

205
00:09:57.135 --> 00:09:58.945
Then in verse seven, you have him taking the form

206
00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:02.105
of a servant in the likeness of men, just like the form

207
00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:05.025
of God term in verse six, doesn't mean less than God, right?

208
00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:11.265
He's equal. This phrase, form of a servant.

209
00:10:13.065 --> 00:10:15.665
Likeness of man does not mean like less

210
00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:16.785
than human in any way.

211
00:10:16.925 --> 00:10:18.305
It means equal with all humans.

212
00:10:18.925 --> 00:10:20.145
So he was fully God

213
00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:24.605
and fully human, even in just these two verses.

214
00:10:24.905 --> 00:10:26.925
God is very God, God is very man.

215
00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:29.325
That was some of the, the creed language we saw.

216
00:10:29.865 --> 00:10:32.765
But in between you have this phrase, he emptied himself.

217
00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:35.765
And that's the question. So I, I don't think,

218
00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:38.885
we shouldn't think that it means he became less than fully

219
00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:42.485
divine is not fully God in some way.

220
00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:45.285
He didn't empty himself of deity.

221
00:10:45.285 --> 00:10:47.845
And I mentioned this on Sunday, the Colossians two,

222
00:10:47.845 --> 00:10:50.765
nine verse where it says in him, in Christ,

223
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:55.125
in the bodily form, the whole fullness

224
00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:59.525
of deity dwells bodily whole fullness,

225
00:11:00.505 --> 00:11:05.285
not just deity dwells in bo in the body.

226
00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:09.605
The whole fullness of deity dwells in the body.

227
00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.525
So he didn't empty, he didn't empty himself.

228
00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:16.045
If anything that would make up deity, make up godness.

229
00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:19.045
He, he didn't set any of that aside.

230
00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:24.965
The best clue comes probably from John 17, five, how

231
00:11:24.965 --> 00:11:27.685
to think about this emptying where Jesus says in his prayer,

232
00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:30.005
John 17, his prayer to the Father says, father,

233
00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:34.365
glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had

234
00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:36.045
with you before the world existed.

235
00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:42.285
So he's identifying, I was there from

236
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.405
before the world began.

237
00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:47.925
I was in this trinity, beautiful communion

238
00:11:48.665 --> 00:11:51.965
and have always been and was at the throne of God.

239
00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:57.305
I, I wanna be back there. That's the glory that I've let

240
00:11:58.015 --> 00:12:01.625
kind of set aside in a sense to be here.

241
00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:08.855
So this, this incarnate Christ has a divine nature.

242
00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:13.255
He's fully God, but there are aspects of his glory

243
00:12:14.085 --> 00:12:16.055
that he would have laid aside.

244
00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:18.495
That's why he's saying here in John 17, father, restore

245
00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:21.495
to me the glory that I have with you from

246
00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:22.895
before the foundation of the world.

247
00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:25.015
So that would include then

248
00:12:25.555 --> 00:12:29.255
at least the privileges, right?

249
00:12:29.255 --> 00:12:30.855
That's what we saw. The, the quote said,

250
00:12:31.155 --> 00:12:33.895
or the footnote said, a thing to be held onto for advantage.

251
00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:37.735
So that would include like the privileges of deity

252
00:12:37.735 --> 00:12:40.735
that stand between the divine Christ

253
00:12:41.555 --> 00:12:42.775
in all the fullness of God.

254
00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:47.415
How that stands between that and the suffering and shame

255
00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:49.775
and death of the cross.

256
00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:55.135
Like there's something between there that has to be kind of

257
00:12:55.915 --> 00:12:58.935
set aside in order to get there.

258
00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:01.895
He moved from such height

259
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:05.255
to the shameful degradation on our behalf.

260
00:13:06.045 --> 00:13:07.375
Paul says in Philippians two,

261
00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:10.175
that's the same mindset we should have towards other

262
00:13:10.175 --> 00:13:11.655
people, right?

263
00:13:11.715 --> 00:13:13.415
The same mind that Christ had

264
00:13:13.415 --> 00:13:16.615
and having this incarnation from glory to shame.

265
00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:19.695
We should have the same as we look to serve other people.

266
00:13:21.245 --> 00:13:24.455
Okay? So then what do we mean? This, this?

267
00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:26.815
We gotta qualify that. 'cause it would be a mistake

268
00:13:26.815 --> 00:13:28.815
to say he set aside all the divine glory

269
00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:32.935
because part of the nature of God is glory.

270
00:13:34.075 --> 00:13:35.975
So he's still the divine nature.

271
00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:39.335
So how does it still, how does he still have some glory,

272
00:13:39.955 --> 00:13:42.055
but not all the glory that he had?

273
00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.375
Because John one 14,

274
00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:46.015
remember the word became fleshed, dwelt among us.

275
00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.095
We've seen his glory.

276
00:13:48.505 --> 00:13:50.335
Glory as of the only son from the Father

277
00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:51.655
full of grace and truth.

278
00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:55.495
So there was a divine glory, even in the incarnate Christ,

279
00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:57.655
for people to see if they had eyes to see it.

280
00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:04.025
But it couldn't be the full glory of God.

281
00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:06.385
Because what would that do to sinners,

282
00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:12.735
Incinerate, sinners, the full glory of God,

283
00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:14.775
no presence of sin.

284
00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:17.095
Just immediately they would be

285
00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:19.175
incinerated it blinded people.

286
00:14:20.155 --> 00:14:21.375
We saw a glimpse of this.

287
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:23.175
Think about Jesus on the mountaintop.

288
00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:25.695
When he's transfigured, Peter, James

289
00:14:25.695 --> 00:14:27.215
and John get to go up on the mountain with him.

290
00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:31.855
Jesus lets them have a glimpse of the full glory

291
00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:34.215
when he is up on the mountaintop,

292
00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:37.695
because he's shining, he's glow, right?

293
00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:40.535
There's a, there's a difference to Jesus on the mountaintop.

294
00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:45.375
Then there was day to day that was a measure of showing them

295
00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:50.045
some of the things that were restrained in a sense there.

296
00:14:51.025 --> 00:14:53.045
So here's a, again, a better way to say it.

297
00:14:53.405 --> 00:14:55.365
Whatever stood between the fullness of the divine glory

298
00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:58.605
before the incarnation and the suffering and shame

299
00:14:58.605 --> 00:15:01.005
and degradation and death of the cross, whatever stood

300
00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:03.845
between there that had to be a laid aside so he could do it,

301
00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:08.045
but nothing having to do with his divinity, his godhead,

302
00:15:08.185 --> 00:15:10.405
his God, nature, none of that.

303
00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:15.645
So that would say hopefully some of the answer to

304
00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:16.965
that question, a little bit of

305
00:15:16.995 --> 00:15:19.405
what did he set aside when he came?

306
00:15:19.425 --> 00:15:20.805
It wasn't any of his divine nature,

307
00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:22.565
because that's what that image was

308
00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:23.605
of Jesus sleeping in the boat.

309
00:15:23.925 --> 00:15:28.085
Remember where there's this massive storm raging around him,

310
00:15:28.665 --> 00:15:32.805
and he's on this open canoe, essentially just napping

311
00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:37.485
The professional fishermen over here freaking out

312
00:15:37.485 --> 00:15:38.805
because they don't know what's happening.

313
00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:40.805
And they're like, we we're gonna die. Don't you care?

314
00:15:41.025 --> 00:15:45.205
And he's sleeping human, yet

315
00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:48.845
he's stands up, says one word.

316
00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:53.685
Everything stops. Only God can do that.

317
00:15:54.895 --> 00:15:59.605
Human divine in one person. Okay?

318
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.485
Now here's another question. I actually got this one already

319
00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:04.125
this week and want to address it.

320
00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:08.245
The omnipresence of God. Okay?

321
00:16:08.245 --> 00:16:12.225
So if God didn't have to limit himself in,

322
00:16:12.365 --> 00:16:16.585
in any real divinity kind of way to come to earth,

323
00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:20.265
still fully God, what about his omnipresence?

324
00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:24.745
Because Jesus is one location seems right.

325
00:16:25.455 --> 00:16:27.225
He's a man walking around like,

326
00:16:27.545 --> 00:16:29.505
I can't be in multiple locations at once.

327
00:16:29.695 --> 00:16:30.985
Only one location.

328
00:16:31.045 --> 00:16:33.065
You walk up to Jesus, you touch him, you see him.

329
00:16:33.065 --> 00:16:36.265
That's, that's seeming to limit God.

330
00:16:36.325 --> 00:16:39.185
The son's omnipresence, all presence.

331
00:16:39.255 --> 00:16:41.945
He's present everywhere. 'cause the Trinity, right?

332
00:16:42.145 --> 00:16:45.985
God, the Father, son Spirit is all yes, omnipresent

333
00:16:48.165 --> 00:16:49.265
in its essence.

334
00:16:51.045 --> 00:16:52.065
But what about the son?

335
00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:54.105
What about Jesus taking on the flesh?

336
00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:55.745
What, what happened there?

337
00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:58.465
'cause we think about the incarnation, we think about

338
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.385
Christmas, baby Jesus being born and right.

339
00:17:02.485 --> 00:17:04.785
So it's clearly a miracle,

340
00:17:05.965 --> 00:17:09.065
but does it limit his omnipresence?

341
00:17:10.735 --> 00:17:13.105
Well, one of the attributes

342
00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:17.185
of God we looked at a couple weeks ago was impassability.

343
00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:21.795
Impassability is a long word

344
00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:23.195
that simply means God doesn't change.

345
00:17:25.495 --> 00:17:27.675
So if God doesn't change

346
00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:29.315
and he's omnipresent,

347
00:17:30.025 --> 00:17:32.435
that means he still is omnipresent even

348
00:17:32.435 --> 00:17:33.675
as God the son incarnate.

349
00:17:35.415 --> 00:17:37.915
And you're like, okay, wait a second. How?

350
00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:43.315
Okay, yes, let's try to answer that because he's impassable.

351
00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:46.995
God cannot be omnipresent.

352
00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:50.325
Yet here we have Jesus.

353
00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:53.805
So for Jesus Christ

354
00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:56.245
to be God incarnate must not mean he was no longer

355
00:17:56.345 --> 00:17:57.365
God omnipresent.

356
00:17:58.785 --> 00:18:00.965
He, he has to still be omnipresent even

357
00:18:00.985 --> 00:18:02.885
as God the son incarnate.

358
00:18:05.115 --> 00:18:07.375
So remember, the divine nature does not go any,

359
00:18:07.435 --> 00:18:12.215
it does not undergo any essential change in the incarnation.

360
00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:13.855
Still, God, the Son, still fully God.

361
00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:17.775
All the divinity fullness of God dwells bodily.

362
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:20.895
So still, all of God still there.

363
00:18:23.195 --> 00:18:26.695
So what is he talking about? Well, again, we said it.

364
00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:29.855
Philippians Institute didn't exploit his divinity

365
00:18:31.075 --> 00:18:33.375
to leverage it against the fullness of humanity.

366
00:18:33.515 --> 00:18:35.775
He fully experienced humanity like you and I do,

367
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.855
but he didn't void his deity.

368
00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.415
Again, this is the mystery of this.

369
00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:50.095
So he, he, he emptied the glory.

370
00:18:51.555 --> 00:18:54.495
And so he did not employ all

371
00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:58.415
of the divine abilities at his disposal because,

372
00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:02.215
'cause if he, because subtracted those somehow,

373
00:19:03.405 --> 00:19:05.215
then he wouldn't be fully God anymore.

374
00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:09.695
So somehow he's subtracted, but not subtracted.

375
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:11.575
He just chose not to employ.

376
00:19:12.195 --> 00:19:13.855
So here's the, here's the alternative.

377
00:19:15.635 --> 00:19:18.095
If he's not both incarnate

378
00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:22.975
and omnipresent at the same time, then we either have

379
00:19:24.495 --> 00:19:26.815
a lesser incarnation on one hand

380
00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.055
because he's not fully God, then,

381
00:19:29.145 --> 00:19:31.415
which means he can't fully satisfy the sin

382
00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:33.335
that we have against God.

383
00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:36.725
Or we have a lesser godhead on the other side,

384
00:19:38.035 --> 00:19:39.525
that he's not fully God

385
00:19:40.735 --> 00:19:44.115
and that means he's not able to be God.

386
00:19:44.415 --> 00:19:46.915
So, so we have this option, the alternatives

387
00:19:46.915 --> 00:19:48.475
to not omnipresent

388
00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:52.635
and incarnate is that, here's

389
00:19:52.655 --> 00:19:55.275
how John Calvin said it way smarter than us

390
00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:59.555
for even if the word in his immeasurable essence united

391
00:19:59.675 --> 00:20:03.555
with the nature of man into one person, we do not imagine

392
00:20:03.555 --> 00:20:05.555
that he was confined therein.

393
00:20:07.695 --> 00:20:08.835
Here's something marvelous.

394
00:20:08.935 --> 00:20:12.355
The son of God descended from heaven in such a way

395
00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:16.275
that without leaving heaven, he willed

396
00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:19.955
to be born in the virgin's womb to go about the earth,

397
00:20:20.255 --> 00:20:21.355
to hang upon the cross.

398
00:20:22.095 --> 00:20:24.555
Yet he continuously filled the world even

399
00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:26.115
as he had done from the beginning.

400
00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:32.115
Wow. So here's what he's saying.

401
00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:37.075
And it's hard for us because we think in space

402
00:20:37.095 --> 00:20:38.955
and time, right?

403
00:20:38.975 --> 00:20:40.315
We, we only think in space

404
00:20:40.335 --> 00:20:42.715
and we, we have no concept of outside of time.

405
00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:45.275
We have no concept of omnipresence 'cause we're limited.

406
00:20:47.585 --> 00:20:52.045
So we, we have to understand God's incarnation in Christ

407
00:20:53.145 --> 00:20:55.645
was not an exit from heaven

408
00:20:58.635 --> 00:21:02.935
so much as a descent, like down the ski slope, an a descent,

409
00:21:03.335 --> 00:21:05.815
a extension, you might say

410
00:21:08.665 --> 00:21:12.235
that even, uh, in John's gospel, he says, so Christ

411
00:21:12.415 --> 00:21:13.795
who is in heaven

412
00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:17.785
clothed himself in our fre our flesh.

413
00:21:18.885 --> 00:21:22.505
So in a sense, you could think like he stretched out his

414
00:21:22.505 --> 00:21:24.985
brotherly hand to us.

415
00:21:26.925 --> 00:21:29.505
So he may raise us to heaven with himself.

416
00:21:31.515 --> 00:21:33.255
Now, that again, blows our minds

417
00:21:33.255 --> 00:21:37.455
because we, we think, we think location,

418
00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:43.935
but he merely extended himself to take on flesh so

419
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:46.375
that we could be with him forever.

420
00:21:46.695 --> 00:21:48.495
'cause again, the son is sent, he's co-equal

421
00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:50.295
with the father mutually in dwells the Father

422
00:21:50.405 --> 00:21:51.735
omnipresent as the Father.

423
00:21:53.035 --> 00:21:55.695
He, he's not leaving the Father.

424
00:21:57.155 --> 00:22:01.055
God the Son doesn't leave the Father and do his own thing

425
00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:02.575
or, or move through space.

426
00:22:03.845 --> 00:22:05.895
Because remember, heaven's not like a location

427
00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:07.895
that we could find in the universe, right?

428
00:22:09.585 --> 00:22:11.365
We can't go searching through the galaxies

429
00:22:11.385 --> 00:22:12.605
and find heaven somewhere.

430
00:22:12.985 --> 00:22:16.405
Heaven is, is the spiritual reality of where God is.

431
00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:18.765
And that supersedes time and location.

432
00:22:20.825 --> 00:22:23.045
So it's not like the son left

433
00:22:24.565 --> 00:22:26.445
a location like Amarillo, Texas

434
00:22:27.425 --> 00:22:31.965
and came west to head to the mountains to go up to

435
00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:34.285
Los Alamos, New Mexico.

436
00:22:35.795 --> 00:22:39.015
He didn't leave a location, leave his father behind.

437
00:22:40.495 --> 00:22:42.455
'cause again, Jesus himself says it,

438
00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.775
I'm in the Father, the father's in me.

439
00:22:46.005 --> 00:22:49.425
So that relationship never separated, never left.

440
00:22:49.805 --> 00:22:54.425
In fact, there's still one, it's an extension in a sense

441
00:22:54.935 --> 00:22:57.545
that he didn't get further away from the Father

442
00:22:57.565 --> 00:22:58.825
as he drew closer to us.

443
00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:04.865
He who sent me is with me in that way. Okay?

444
00:23:05.285 --> 00:23:07.785
So we're gonna get to some questions here in a second,

445
00:23:07.885 --> 00:23:11.665
but I want to, I wanna use one of the, uh,

446
00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:17.945
the famous catechisms Catechisms are, uh, explanations

447
00:23:17.945 --> 00:23:20.945
of the faith in simple terms, kind of q, q and a question

448
00:23:20.945 --> 00:23:22.505
and answer type setups.

449
00:23:24.005 --> 00:23:25.825
And I wanna walk through three of these

450
00:23:26.095 --> 00:23:30.585
because it helps us understand God incarnation

451
00:23:31.335 --> 00:23:33.545
both divinity and humanity in that.

452
00:23:34.245 --> 00:23:36.385
And it helps us talk about our salvation rightly too.

453
00:23:36.385 --> 00:23:37.585
When we think about salvation,

454
00:23:37.585 --> 00:23:39.625
when we think about the trinity and we think about the

455
00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:41.305
incarnation, we can't just think about like these

456
00:23:41.305 --> 00:23:42.585
theoretical ideas.

457
00:23:43.885 --> 00:23:45.525
We think about salvation.

458
00:23:46.145 --> 00:23:51.005
We should, that the trinity is essentially about salvation.

459
00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:56.045
Now, the father plan, the son executed, the spirit confirms

460
00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.925
then the two natures.

461
00:23:58.925 --> 00:24:02.765
In one person of Jesus, you think about the, the reality

462
00:24:02.765 --> 00:24:06.085
of his godness means it's acceptable sacrifice.

463
00:24:06.105 --> 00:24:08.885
His humanity means he counts for us, right?

464
00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:10.685
So that's this's all about salvation

465
00:24:10.705 --> 00:24:11.845
in the end when you think about it.

466
00:24:12.025 --> 00:24:13.685
But these are the, the three questions,

467
00:24:14.425 --> 00:24:15.685
and I'm gonna read, just read 'em

468
00:24:15.685 --> 00:24:17.005
and kind of let, let 'em sit on this.

469
00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:21.565
What kind of mediator and deliver should we look for?

470
00:24:23.225 --> 00:24:24.445
One who is a true

471
00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:29.525
and righteous human, yet more powerful than all creatures.

472
00:24:30.355 --> 00:24:32.605
That is one who is also true God,

473
00:24:35.155 --> 00:24:37.965
true and righteous human who is also true God.

474
00:24:37.985 --> 00:24:39.485
That's our mediator and deliver.

475
00:24:39.485 --> 00:24:42.405
We should look for now why The second next question.

476
00:24:42.505 --> 00:24:44.725
Why must the mediator be a true and righteous human?

477
00:24:46.845 --> 00:24:50.315
God's justice demands that human nature which has sinned

478
00:24:50.825 --> 00:24:52.155
must pay for sin.

479
00:24:53.415 --> 00:24:55.675
But a sinful human could never pay for others.

480
00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:58.915
So that's why it's important

481
00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:00.115
that he's true, righteous human.

482
00:25:00.305 --> 00:25:01.475
Then he counts for us

483
00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:03.075
and he's the only one who could do that.

484
00:25:03.615 --> 00:25:05.835
But why must the mediator also be true God?

485
00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:10.175
So that the mediator by the power of his divinity

486
00:25:10.705 --> 00:25:14.335
might bear the weight of God's wrath in his humanity

487
00:25:14.835 --> 00:25:18.095
and earn for us and restore to us righteousness and life.

488
00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:22.735
So only a human can save humans.

489
00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:26.455
Only God can bear the weight of God's wrath.

490
00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:31.575
That's why we look for must look for a mediator

491
00:25:31.575 --> 00:25:32.775
and deliver who is a true

492
00:25:32.775 --> 00:25:35.735
and righteous human, yet who is also true God.

493
00:25:37.355 --> 00:25:41.695
That's the beauty of the incarnation to nature's one person.

494
00:25:43.795 --> 00:25:45.255
So I know there's a ton of questions about

495
00:25:45.255 --> 00:25:46.775
that tr come on up here.

496
00:25:47.185 --> 00:25:51.695
We're gonna talk through some of those as we get together.

497
00:25:51.865 --> 00:25:54.695
First, be thinking about questions as we go forward.

498
00:25:56.075 --> 00:25:59.135
I'm gonna put him on the spot a little bit tonight,

499
00:26:00.555 --> 00:26:03.015
but I would say you have the opportunity

500
00:26:03.235 --> 00:26:05.855
to ask some questions as well as we go forward.

501
00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:11.095
All right? Okay.

502
00:26:12.355 --> 00:26:15.215
So I've already preempted him a little bit on these,

503
00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:16.815
but I'm gonna surprise 'em too.

504
00:26:21.475 --> 00:26:22.495
Thanks for being up here.

505
00:26:22.515 --> 00:26:25.295
We should had chairs like this for everybody, these chairs.

506
00:26:25.295 --> 00:26:26.815
This is great. Are these are nice?

507
00:26:27.805 --> 00:26:29.175
Feel kind Of weird. These are comfy.

508
00:26:30.995 --> 00:26:34.775
I'm ready to not sit in it though, by the way. So, okay.

509
00:26:34.775 --> 00:26:37.255
So when we think about this, um,

510
00:26:39.685 --> 00:26:41.335
some of these are already like, um,

511
00:26:43.775 --> 00:26:44.845
we've answered them already.

512
00:26:44.845 --> 00:26:45.965
They're sort of obvious,

513
00:26:46.145 --> 00:26:49.925
but just helpful was God the son's origin in Bethlehem

514
00:26:52.505 --> 00:26:56.485
Was So, was God the son's origin in Bethlehem?

515
00:26:56.955 --> 00:26:59.045
Yeah. No, I mean, I think it is,

516
00:26:59.045 --> 00:27:01.125
we would say God the Son has always existed.

517
00:27:01.275 --> 00:27:04.365
Okay. Right. In that relationship, we see the relationship

518
00:27:04.425 --> 00:27:08.085
of the Trinity from, we talked about that last week.

519
00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:09.845
Mm-Hmm. Right. Some, I think it was last week

520
00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:11.045
seems like a long time ago.

521
00:27:11.105 --> 00:27:14.405
But, um, in that, that relational component

522
00:27:14.505 --> 00:27:15.525
of the trinity always existed

523
00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:18.325
and we see the, the flesh we see'em take on

524
00:27:18.325 --> 00:27:19.405
flesh in Bethlehem.

525
00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:24.085
Absolutely. Um, but certainly he, he existed as God the son.

526
00:27:24.235 --> 00:27:26.045
Yeah. For eternity past. Good.

527
00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:27.725
It's like word son Christ.

528
00:27:27.745 --> 00:27:29.205
We see that progression from John one.

529
00:27:29.745 --> 00:27:32.405
So then, uh, what was Jesus' role in creation?

530
00:27:32.955 --> 00:27:36.245
Because Hebrews one talks about Jesus

531
00:27:37.065 --> 00:27:40.205
and it talks about him being the one who sustains creation.

532
00:27:40.205 --> 00:27:43.605
So was so was Jesus involved in creation?

533
00:27:44.565 --> 00:27:48.685
I think we see, we see evidences of that certainly in, um,

534
00:27:48.825 --> 00:27:51.125
in cautions where it talks about in Him all things were

535
00:27:51.125 --> 00:27:53.365
created and he, he is still a sustainer of all things.

536
00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:55.885
And then the, we talked last week some about the poor

537
00:27:56.285 --> 00:27:59.285
pronouns also that we see in, uh, Genesis,

538
00:27:59.325 --> 00:28:03.645
particularly at the, um, in the narrative in Genesis one of

539
00:28:04.405 --> 00:28:06.525
creation of man when God says, let us.

540
00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:08.045
And so we would say yes, that,

541
00:28:08.275 --> 00:28:11.685
that Jesus very much was a part of, of all of creation.

542
00:28:11.745 --> 00:28:14.725
But, but we see that most notably in creation of man.

543
00:28:16.155 --> 00:28:19.685
Yeah. And if you wanted to get super technical,

544
00:28:22.335 --> 00:28:27.155
you can say that technically Jesus Christ

545
00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:31.635
did not exist before Bethlehem.

546
00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:36.435
But you push that too far

547
00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:38.995
and you start to get into some problems

548
00:28:38.995 --> 00:28:43.195
because even Paul talks about Jesus

549
00:28:43.195 --> 00:28:44.475
having pre-existent.

550
00:28:46.095 --> 00:28:50.475
So like 'cause Right Word Son took on flesh.

551
00:28:50.815 --> 00:28:54.515
We know Miss Christ. So, so to our minds,

552
00:28:54.515 --> 00:28:56.915
our visual pictures Bethlehem, Jesus Christ

553
00:28:57.455 --> 00:28:59.955
is when Jesus Christ began, so to speak.

554
00:29:00.215 --> 00:29:03.635
But Paul looks at it as if it's all connected,

555
00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:07.435
that the Christ is the Son, is the word.

556
00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:12.355
And that essentially the pre-existent one Jesus,

557
00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:13.955
it's Christ as well.

558
00:29:14.495 --> 00:29:16.515
So you could, you could try to split that hair

559
00:29:16.515 --> 00:29:17.595
and try to get technical.

560
00:29:18.735 --> 00:29:20.555
You're gonna get in some trouble probably there.

561
00:29:20.775 --> 00:29:23.395
So just even as we say like,

562
00:29:23.515 --> 00:29:24.835
'cause that's where people have actually pushed back.

563
00:29:24.835 --> 00:29:26.275
It's like, well, Jesus didn't exist before.

564
00:29:26.345 --> 00:29:28.995
Like why are we talking about, uh, okay,

565
00:29:30.725 --> 00:29:32.675
Jesus is the son, is the word.

566
00:29:33.255 --> 00:29:36.315
So you could try to split that, but you have to be careful

567
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:41.645
and, and realize that when we say Jesus preexisted this,

568
00:29:41.795 --> 00:29:43.805
this theology behind is what we mean.

569
00:29:44.255 --> 00:29:49.005
Right. Okay. Um, did Jesus ever sin?

570
00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:53.845
No. No. Okay, here's the follow up.

571
00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:56.045
Was he capable of sinning?

572
00:29:58.345 --> 00:30:02.005
So I think the,

573
00:30:02.225 --> 00:30:06.565
the word would be no, he had flesh that felt the temptation,

574
00:30:07.065 --> 00:30:11.205
but his full deity, he was incapable of sin

575
00:30:11.205 --> 00:30:13.885
because he is, he is holy and righteousness.

576
00:30:13.885 --> 00:30:15.285
He is holiness and righteousness.

577
00:30:15.345 --> 00:30:18.645
And so I think we see that as he, he took on

578
00:30:18.675 --> 00:30:22.485
that he took on flesh in the same way we took on flesh.

579
00:30:22.625 --> 00:30:27.405
He had a, a, a flesh that was created, um, by God.

580
00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:30.925
Um, and I was reading some other things thinking about the

581
00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:35.045
same way that in some ways God created Adam in the

582
00:30:35.045 --> 00:30:36.325
flesh, right?

583
00:30:37.105 --> 00:30:42.085
And so, um, but Adam wasn't also fully God.

584
00:30:42.625 --> 00:30:43.725
And, um,

585
00:30:44.345 --> 00:30:48.005
and so we see that Christ had those same experiences we read

586
00:30:48.105 --> 00:30:50.805
in the, in the desert of his temptations that he faced.

587
00:30:50.865 --> 00:30:53.965
And yet in his deity, he was able

588
00:30:53.965 --> 00:30:55.765
to walk perfectly that perfect life.

589
00:30:56.875 --> 00:30:58.765
Yeah, that's a, that's not a trick question,

590
00:30:58.765 --> 00:31:00.245
but it is kind of a tricky question.

591
00:31:01.065 --> 00:31:05.125
Um, because there is these two natures in one person,

592
00:31:05.425 --> 00:31:08.765
the divine nature we know could not sin.

593
00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:12.965
Um, James talks about that, right? Could not be be tempted.

594
00:31:14.025 --> 00:31:16.605
So the divine nature absolutely could not have.

595
00:31:17.505 --> 00:31:18.765
But this is where the, the rub

596
00:31:18.765 --> 00:31:23.005
with the human nature comes in, is that could he could,

597
00:31:23.095 --> 00:31:26.605
could the human nature of Jesus sin, could it,

598
00:31:26.605 --> 00:31:27.685
could he have sinned?

599
00:31:29.265 --> 00:31:31.485
And in, in one sense, there's a lot of debate about this.

600
00:31:31.485 --> 00:31:32.765
You could read a lot of things,

601
00:31:32.905 --> 00:31:36.885
but in one sense, you have to say kind of yes

602
00:31:38.655 --> 00:31:41.395
to the extent where he would then identify with

603
00:31:42.295 --> 00:31:43.475
our temptations.

604
00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:48.355
But the difference for him is he had this

605
00:31:49.025 --> 00:31:53.435
perfect human nature, not tainted by the sin of Adam.

606
00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:55.635
'cause he wasn't the seed of Adam, right?

607
00:31:55.635 --> 00:31:57.995
You look at Romans, it's all about the seed of Adam.

608
00:31:58.535 --> 00:32:01.435
Is is part of why we are fallen and broken too.

609
00:32:02.215 --> 00:32:04.995
The seed of Adam was not in Jesus

610
00:32:05.985 --> 00:32:10.955
because he who was his father, it wasn't, it wasn't Joseph,

611
00:32:11.215 --> 00:32:12.835
it wasn't a physical human.

612
00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:18.425
It was the divine mixed with the

613
00:32:19.155 --> 00:32:22.785
human flesh, offspring,

614
00:32:22.935 --> 00:32:24.465
seed of Mary.

615
00:32:26.325 --> 00:32:30.265
So in a sense, you would say yes,

616
00:32:31.445 --> 00:32:35.105
but his human nature perfect as it was,

617
00:32:35.365 --> 00:32:37.665
was fully submitted to the divine will.

618
00:32:37.765 --> 00:32:40.685
So his human will fully submitted to the divine will

619
00:32:41.955 --> 00:32:43.175
100% of the time.

620
00:32:44.755 --> 00:32:46.215
So could he have sinned?

621
00:32:46.555 --> 00:32:49.335
No, because his human nature was always submitted

622
00:32:49.335 --> 00:32:50.135
to the divine nature

623
00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:51.975
human will submitted to the divine will.

624
00:32:52.035 --> 00:32:56.095
So there's a sense where he, he could not have, if

625
00:32:56.095 --> 00:32:57.855
that's true, if you're always submitted to the will

626
00:32:57.855 --> 00:32:58.935
of God, you're not gonna sin.

627
00:32:59.395 --> 00:33:02.615
We can't do that. But the human nature, that was not seed

628
00:33:02.615 --> 00:33:05.535
of Adam could but you, you can.

629
00:33:05.795 --> 00:33:07.175
So that's where Hebrews four,

630
00:33:07.435 --> 00:33:09.695
we don't have a divine priest who's a great high priest

631
00:33:09.695 --> 00:33:11.415
who's unable to sympathize with our weaknesses.

632
00:33:11.675 --> 00:33:13.895
He knows what it feels like to be tempted, like he said,

633
00:33:13.915 --> 00:33:18.175
the, the wilderness scene walking down the streets

634
00:33:18.195 --> 00:33:20.775
of these cities where there'd be prostitutes,

635
00:33:20.775 --> 00:33:23.575
there'd be open sexual activity happening.

636
00:33:23.595 --> 00:33:26.015
You don't think Jesus faced the same temptations we face,

637
00:33:26.015 --> 00:33:27.255
just turned on the tv, right?

638
00:33:29.115 --> 00:33:30.135
He didn't have a phone in his pocket,

639
00:33:30.135 --> 00:33:33.415
but he faced the temptations we faced and yet didn't send.

640
00:33:33.515 --> 00:33:36.975
So it's a bit of a trick e question.

641
00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.535
Um, but, but there is that sense.

642
00:33:39.555 --> 00:33:42.375
We have to have him being human to identify with us

643
00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:43.455
and be our sacrifice.

644
00:33:43.475 --> 00:33:44.895
But he cannot be anything

645
00:33:44.895 --> 00:33:46.895
but divine at the same time so

646
00:33:46.895 --> 00:33:49.455
that he could be the substitute for us.

647
00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:53.055
So good, good stuff. Alright, so what do you have?

648
00:33:53.085 --> 00:33:55.815
What questions do you have about these things?

649
00:33:55.815 --> 00:33:57.575
We've got two mics up here.

650
00:33:59.915 --> 00:34:02.055
You're gonna stump us at one point or another.

651
00:34:02.155 --> 00:34:06.695
So we'll say that. Honestly, it's a mystery.

652
00:34:08.955 --> 00:34:10.775
Unless you have a question that you want to ask,

653
00:34:10.775 --> 00:34:13.975
if nobody else is gonna ask, you can ask them

654
00:34:14.395 --> 00:34:15.395
And see what they say. So

655
00:34:15.395 --> 00:34:16.935
Jeff's coming up with a question.

656
00:34:17.135 --> 00:34:20.655
I got one question a couple weeks ago in Nicaragua from one

657
00:34:20.655 --> 00:34:25.135
of the students asked, so if, if Jesus was born and Mary

658
00:34:25.715 --> 00:34:29.295
and he grew and was born to Mary and their blood mixed

659
00:34:29.395 --> 00:34:32.975
and our sin nature is passed through the blood, then how,

660
00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:34.855
how was he, how did he escape that

661
00:34:35.715 --> 00:34:37.415
Our sin nature is passed through the blood?

662
00:34:37.765 --> 00:34:39.935
That was the, that was the uh,

663
00:34:40.805 --> 00:34:43.455
Yeah, That was put forth in the question. Hmm.

664
00:34:43.895 --> 00:34:45.575
Interesting. Well we would say that,

665
00:34:45.575 --> 00:34:47.855
that it's the sin nature's not passed through the blood.

666
00:34:47.925 --> 00:34:49.255
It's through the seed, right?

667
00:34:49.255 --> 00:34:52.135
Through that it, it's a bit of a physical element,

668
00:34:52.155 --> 00:34:53.335
but really it's the spiritual element

669
00:34:53.335 --> 00:34:55.455
that goes all the way back to, to Adam in that sense.

670
00:34:55.525 --> 00:34:57.735
Yeah. Good, good question. I love that.

671
00:34:58.375 --> 00:34:59.255
Apparently there was, Chris

672
00:34:59.265 --> 00:35:00.615
Duran was in Nicaragua last year.

673
00:35:00.615 --> 00:35:02.975
They had a lively debate about the Trinity.

674
00:35:03.165 --> 00:35:06.895
Yeah, it got a little hot, a little fun. So

675
00:35:07.045 --> 00:35:08.045
Yeah. And that was

676
00:35:08.045 --> 00:35:08.815
kind of, I think that,

677
00:35:09.115 --> 00:35:11.775
and also that, I mean, right, this,

678
00:35:11.915 --> 00:35:14.215
it is not a biological passage of sin.

679
00:35:14.395 --> 00:35:16.855
Sin, the spiritual sin is a spiritual burden.

680
00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:19.895
The sin of the human nature is a, it's a spiritual burden

681
00:35:19.925 --> 00:35:22.095
that we, that we faced and that was what we talked about.

682
00:35:22.095 --> 00:35:24.575
And that it wasn't the, that there's well, there wasn't a,

683
00:35:25.585 --> 00:35:28.695
Jesus wasn't half Mary and half Holy Spirit.

684
00:35:28.695 --> 00:35:31.295
Right? He was created by God in Mary's womb. Yep.

685
00:35:31.325 --> 00:35:33.295
That was kind of, yep. Alright, go ahead Jeff. Yeah,

686
00:35:33.535 --> 00:35:35.335
I did wanna go first 'cause I asked a question last week.

687
00:35:35.605 --> 00:35:36.735
Yeah. Hit it. And

688
00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:38.565
The goal is not to stump, this is one

689
00:35:38.565 --> 00:35:42.005
of my favorite topics to seek understanding

690
00:35:42.025 --> 00:35:45.005
of both the Trinity and Christ's hypostasis and,

691
00:35:45.105 --> 00:35:49.685
and knowing will will never fully get there in these bodies.

692
00:35:49.785 --> 00:35:52.925
But that pursuit that elevates his majesty and who he is

693
00:35:52.925 --> 00:35:56.045
and how he's both able as the divine

694
00:35:56.185 --> 00:35:59.325
and relatable as fully man is kinda where my head's at.

695
00:35:59.425 --> 00:36:02.925
But on the, the Peck ability of Christ, the topic of was,

696
00:36:02.985 --> 00:36:07.845
was Christ able to, to sin, um, both being fully man,

697
00:36:08.185 --> 00:36:10.445
uh, and fully God adjacent to that.

698
00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:14.205
Would you speak to Christ's faith

699
00:36:15.615 --> 00:36:19.845
fully, man, relating to our experience as humans in the,

700
00:36:19.865 --> 00:36:21.005
in the full capacity.

701
00:36:21.505 --> 00:36:25.045
And we as people that are our faith in Christ,

702
00:36:26.265 --> 00:36:28.245
is, is is supreme right?

703
00:36:28.245 --> 00:36:31.125
Is the most important. So for, for understanding how he can

704
00:36:31.505 --> 00:36:36.485
as that full deity relate to us, what is Christ's faith?

705
00:36:36.545 --> 00:36:38.045
What's the, was he was he,

706
00:36:38.505 --> 00:36:42.005
is it Hebrews 1112 talks about like he's the founder

707
00:36:42.065 --> 00:36:45.045
and perfecter of our faith and, um,

708
00:36:45.185 --> 00:36:47.165
but talk, talk about kind of adjacent

709
00:36:47.185 --> 00:36:48.485
to his, his sin ability.

710
00:36:48.485 --> 00:36:51.125
Talk about Christ's faith. Hmm.

711
00:36:52.715 --> 00:36:56.945
Good, good question. Yeah.

712
00:36:56.945 --> 00:36:59.825
Hebrews 12, looking to Jesus, the founder

713
00:37:00.005 --> 00:37:04.665
and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set

714
00:37:04.665 --> 00:37:06.785
before him, endured the cross, despising the shame

715
00:37:06.785 --> 00:37:09.025
and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.

716
00:37:10.445 --> 00:37:13.145
So the founder and perfecter of our faith.

717
00:37:14.685 --> 00:37:18.305
So founder would be, you know, the starter, the beginner,

718
00:37:18.565 --> 00:37:22.665
the creator you might say, of our faith.

719
00:37:23.365 --> 00:37:25.585
Uh, meaning it is what is founded on as well.

720
00:37:26.445 --> 00:37:27.465
And the perfecter

721
00:37:27.465 --> 00:37:30.225
of it means our sanctifying process along the way.

722
00:37:31.925 --> 00:37:33.265
So feel free to jump in

723
00:37:33.505 --> 00:37:35.145
whenever you are, 'cause this is a hard one.

724
00:37:35.245 --> 00:37:36.705
But, uh, I think

725
00:37:38.325 --> 00:37:41.465
you look at like Jesus in the garden the night before.

726
00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:46.385
He is crucified to us, it seems like there's this wrestling,

727
00:37:46.815 --> 00:37:48.345
there's this, this struggle.

728
00:37:48.445 --> 00:37:51.865
He has to place his faith in the divine will.

729
00:37:52.845 --> 00:37:56.865
Um, and I was reading a lot about a lot

730
00:37:56.865 --> 00:37:58.065
of things over the last week.

731
00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:02.585
And that was part of it was, was he truly struggling

732
00:38:03.645 --> 00:38:07.825
to place his faith in his father's will, his will, right?

733
00:38:07.845 --> 00:38:11.065
The divine will. And there was debate on that.

734
00:38:11.065 --> 00:38:12.585
There was some that were saying no,

735
00:38:12.925 --> 00:38:15.145
he wasn't actually struggling with that.

736
00:38:15.285 --> 00:38:19.385
He was struggling with the weight of the divine wrath

737
00:38:19.385 --> 00:38:20.665
that was about to come upon him.

738
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:26.305
And 'cause he, he knew like he, he was not surprised.

739
00:38:27.345 --> 00:38:28.635
Like he wasn't surprised.

740
00:38:28.695 --> 00:38:30.555
He, he didn't set aside his omniscience either,

741
00:38:30.555 --> 00:38:32.915
even though it does seem like he, he did.

742
00:38:33.015 --> 00:38:36.525
But he, he knew the divine wrath was coming.

743
00:38:38.245 --> 00:38:42.145
So how we relate to that then is this, this measure

744
00:38:42.285 --> 00:38:46.825
of seeing hi in his perfection

745
00:38:47.165 --> 00:38:50.505
as a human will fully submitted to the divine will.

746
00:38:50.505 --> 00:38:55.305
That's where he, his faith was, was tied with his will.

747
00:38:56.165 --> 00:38:57.705
Not mine, but yours be done.

748
00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:01.265
Even the Lord's prayer, right?

749
00:39:02.005 --> 00:39:04.265
Uh, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

750
00:39:06.005 --> 00:39:09.185
So when we think about our faith, it's,

751
00:39:09.375 --> 00:39:13.545
it's exactly the same language in a way where we're saying

752
00:39:13.545 --> 00:39:17.785
to God, we want your will to be done in our lives.

753
00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:20.985
We can't do that perfectly like his human will could

754
00:39:20.985 --> 00:39:22.025
with his divine will.

755
00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:24.105
We, we can't. But,

756
00:39:24.245 --> 00:39:28.465
but our growth in perfection of faith is that same idea.

757
00:39:28.745 --> 00:39:32.465
'cause coming off of 11 in chapter 11 of Hebrews,

758
00:39:32.855 --> 00:39:34.745
there's all of these stories of faith

759
00:39:35.715 --> 00:39:37.545
where this one and this one and this one.

760
00:39:37.545 --> 00:39:40.305
And they, they were faithful and they, they saw this happen.

761
00:39:40.305 --> 00:39:42.225
They saw this happen. And,

762
00:39:42.365 --> 00:39:45.705
and then go read 11 tonight, Hebrews 11,

763
00:39:48.045 --> 00:39:51.945
It comes to the end and he says, what shall I say?

764
00:39:51.965 --> 00:39:53.985
All time will tell time would fail

765
00:39:53.985 --> 00:39:55.985
to tell Gideon Barack Samson, Jeff,

766
00:39:56.005 --> 00:39:58.345
the David Samuel the prophets, they,

767
00:39:58.375 --> 00:40:01.305
through faith conquered kingdoms, forced justice,

768
00:40:02.545 --> 00:40:03.665
obtained promises, stop the mouth,

769
00:40:03.665 --> 00:40:06.825
the lines quench the fire escaped the sword made strong came

770
00:40:06.825 --> 00:40:09.585
might in war, put for armies to flight.

771
00:40:09.585 --> 00:40:11.465
Women received back their dead from resurrection.

772
00:40:13.135 --> 00:40:14.145
That was all great.

773
00:40:17.015 --> 00:40:20.585
Some were tortured, refusing to accept release so

774
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.185
that they might rise again to a better life.

775
00:40:22.565 --> 00:40:23.865
Others suffered mocking

776
00:40:23.865 --> 00:40:25.465
and flogging, even chains and imprisonment.

777
00:40:25.465 --> 00:40:27.345
They were stoned. They were in two,

778
00:40:27.615 --> 00:40:28.905
they were killed with a sword.

779
00:40:29.255 --> 00:40:30.625
They went about in skins of sheep

780
00:40:30.625 --> 00:40:32.585
and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated

781
00:40:32.585 --> 00:40:34.025
of whom the world was not worthy,

782
00:40:34.335 --> 00:40:35.985
wandering about in deserts, mountains

783
00:40:35.985 --> 00:40:37.185
and dens and caves of the earth.

784
00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:40.305
All these though, commended for through their faith,

785
00:40:41.485 --> 00:40:43.345
did not receive what was promised since God had

786
00:40:43.465 --> 00:40:45.545
provided something better for us, that apart from us,

787
00:40:45.745 --> 00:40:47.945
they should not be made perfect, complete.

788
00:40:48.925 --> 00:40:52.945
So the faith is acknowledged in what God did

789
00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:55.185
as those like Abraham, Isaac,

790
00:40:55.555 --> 00:40:58.345
Moses, Gideon, David.

791
00:40:58.615 --> 00:41:02.185
They said, God, your will be done. God did amazing things.

792
00:41:02.395 --> 00:41:04.385
These others also said, God, your will be done.

793
00:41:04.445 --> 00:41:08.865
And they got cut in half. Therefore,

794
00:41:08.865 --> 00:41:10.385
verse one of chapter 12,

795
00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:12.985
therefore since we're surrounded by so great a cloud

796
00:41:12.985 --> 00:41:16.785
of witnesses, let us also lay aside the weight and sin.

797
00:41:17.045 --> 00:41:18.425
Let us run with endurance the race set

798
00:41:18.425 --> 00:41:20.425
before us looking to Jesus, the founder

799
00:41:20.445 --> 00:41:21.905
and perfecter of our faith.

800
00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:25.425
Mm-Hmm. So he's saying he's tying that to the example

801
00:41:25.425 --> 00:41:26.665
of those people saying they,

802
00:41:26.835 --> 00:41:28.705
their whole life was God, your will be done.

803
00:41:29.845 --> 00:41:32.065
Not perfectly. 'cause we know David's story,

804
00:41:32.065 --> 00:41:34.365
we know Abraham's story, the mess

805
00:41:34.365 --> 00:41:36.645
that Moses was right, we know that.

806
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:40.325
But they're commended for saying, God, your will be done.

807
00:41:41.505 --> 00:41:44.805
So in that image of Jesus human nature saying

808
00:41:45.955 --> 00:41:50.045
your will be done, divine will, that's an image for us,

809
00:41:50.045 --> 00:41:52.445
for our faith as well. Anything,

810
00:41:52.995 --> 00:41:53.995
Yeah. That's a, that's

811
00:41:53.995 --> 00:41:54.365
a great,

812
00:41:55.105 --> 00:41:56.845
that's a great thing to think about deeply.

813
00:41:57.345 --> 00:41:58.365
And uh, when,

814
00:41:58.385 --> 00:42:00.525
as you're asking the question I was thinking about, um,

815
00:42:00.625 --> 00:42:02.765
in Romans 10 where it says that faith comes through hearing

816
00:42:02.765 --> 00:42:04.125
and hearing through the word of Christ.

817
00:42:04.665 --> 00:42:06.965
And there's that, there's that element of there.

818
00:42:06.965 --> 00:42:11.005
Think about like having faith, but also exercising faith.

819
00:42:11.065 --> 00:42:14.125
So faithing in faith, almost like a verb. Mm-Hmm.

820
00:42:14.585 --> 00:42:18.405
And for Jesus to, for us to see him exhibit that.

821
00:42:18.865 --> 00:42:21.165
And it took him taking on the flesh then

822
00:42:21.225 --> 00:42:26.125
to experience those things of the, the temptations,

823
00:42:26.265 --> 00:42:30.805
the threats, the attacks, the, um, being forsaken

824
00:42:31.505 --> 00:42:33.365
to, to exercise that.

825
00:42:33.385 --> 00:42:34.925
And he had it perfectly. Mm-Hmm.

826
00:42:35.225 --> 00:42:38.485
And, and I think, um, we talk about like exercising faith.

827
00:42:38.485 --> 00:42:40.605
So our faith grows as we face those temptations.

828
00:42:40.745 --> 00:42:43.965
Now obviously, if our faith comes from hearing the word

829
00:42:43.965 --> 00:42:47.765
of Christ and he, he is the word that he had, he had

830
00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:51.565
that perfectly, but then was able to, um, in the flesh

831
00:42:52.745 --> 00:42:54.765
see it work itself out.

832
00:42:55.425 --> 00:42:58.125
That's that's pretty, I mean that's a, that's like a,

833
00:42:58.765 --> 00:43:00.445
aspirational is not even the right word,

834
00:43:00.705 --> 00:43:04.325
but it's like kind of where we would hope to go.

835
00:43:04.635 --> 00:43:07.085
Yeah. It gives us, it gives us hope. Thank you guys.

836
00:43:07.305 --> 00:43:08.205
Can I ask a follow up

837
00:43:08.325 --> 00:43:09.565
question since nobody's behind me, right? That one

838
00:43:09.805 --> 00:43:12.245
Nobody stated at this way, nobody's behind you go the back

839
00:43:12.245 --> 00:43:13.245
Line. Yeah. On, on on, on

840
00:43:13.245 --> 00:43:14.605
the same vein. I, I I agree.

841
00:43:14.605 --> 00:43:18.405
Like Christ fully man with this perfected faith

842
00:43:18.425 --> 00:43:22.765
and what that, um, enabled him to, to model for us.

843
00:43:23.065 --> 00:43:26.245
Mm-hmm. Similar or may maybe related to the kenosis theory.

844
00:43:27.775 --> 00:43:29.845
Think the, the garden in, in Gethsemane

845
00:43:29.845 --> 00:43:32.605
and Christ saying, you know, let this pass I,

846
00:43:32.905 --> 00:43:35.245
I'd I'd like this, but have confidence in

847
00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.285
your will and submit to that.

848
00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.565
I think that's a, a great example

849
00:43:38.405 --> 00:43:39.565
specifically in his ministry.

850
00:43:40.305 --> 00:43:43.165
We see, I've not done exhaustive look at this,

851
00:43:43.185 --> 00:43:44.845
so there's probably examples.

852
00:43:45.345 --> 00:43:49.845
But seeing the power of Christ's faith in his life,

853
00:43:49.995 --> 00:43:51.805
like in, in his physical time here on life

854
00:43:51.955 --> 00:43:53.245
with a lot of his miracles.

855
00:43:55.035 --> 00:43:57.205
This, this is out there and, and definitely a non-essential.

856
00:43:57.705 --> 00:44:01.005
Um, but did the power come from Christ the man

857
00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:05.485
or did he have perfect faith that God would,

858
00:44:05.785 --> 00:44:07.165
his will would be done in those moments.

859
00:44:07.275 --> 00:44:08.965
Many of the miracles are, it's your faith

860
00:44:08.965 --> 00:44:10.485
that healed you and Jesus just speaks.

861
00:44:10.485 --> 00:44:13.725
And the the first one with the, the storm, right?

862
00:44:13.905 --> 00:44:16.165
He, he just says, calm the storms.

863
00:44:16.165 --> 00:44:17.805
And scripture says, and they stopped it.

864
00:44:17.805 --> 00:44:19.645
Didn't say he made them stop.

865
00:44:20.385 --> 00:44:24.965
Um, are those examples of his perfected faith, kinda like,

866
00:44:24.965 --> 00:44:26.605
he's like kinda like in the garden where like,

867
00:44:27.825 --> 00:44:30.205
is is there a possibility that it wouldn't

868
00:44:30.205 --> 00:44:32.485
or his faith was so, so perfect And,

869
00:44:32.585 --> 00:44:36.725
and what that translates to us as people is in those moments

870
00:44:36.905 --> 00:44:39.605
of affliction and trial and struggle

871
00:44:39.705 --> 00:44:41.805
and when we pray in faith, but we are limited

872
00:44:41.905 --> 00:44:44.085
and we have doubt and fear, right?

873
00:44:44.145 --> 00:44:46.845
And, and those kinds of distractions, does Christ

874
00:44:48.235 --> 00:44:49.445
like, are those good examples?

875
00:44:49.445 --> 00:44:51.045
Like he, what is able

876
00:44:51.045 --> 00:44:55.165
through Christ the man having an example of perfect faith?

877
00:44:56.625 --> 00:45:00.335
That's good. That's a good question. I'm wanna sit down

878
00:45:00.335 --> 00:45:01.335
Because I don't, do you

879
00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:02.375
ever need to go have a cup of coffee?

880
00:45:02.485 --> 00:45:04.255
Yeah. Cup of coffee with Jeff Mann, go

881
00:45:04.255 --> 00:45:05.255
Talk to this guy. Um,

882
00:45:05.255 --> 00:45:09.375
great. That it's, so we, we,

883
00:45:09.555 --> 00:45:13.855
we read one example of where they, um, well,

884
00:45:15.465 --> 00:45:17.385
examples of, so the question is,

885
00:45:17.685 --> 00:45:19.345
was it Christ's power doing the work

886
00:45:19.445 --> 00:45:22.105
or was it his perfected faith and then God did it.

887
00:45:22.685 --> 00:45:25.145
But in a sense it's the same power, his

888
00:45:25.165 --> 00:45:26.545
God Cheat code, right?

889
00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:29.345
It's God cheat code. So here's what,

890
00:45:29.345 --> 00:45:30.745
Here's what I think He

891
00:45:30.745 --> 00:45:31.745
Would say. No, he wasn't

892
00:45:31.745 --> 00:45:33.225
fully man. He was man f**k. Right?

893
00:45:33.415 --> 00:45:36.305
Yeah, Yeah. So that if we think about,

894
00:45:36.605 --> 00:45:39.185
we talked about the essence of God, of our triune God,

895
00:45:39.185 --> 00:45:42.665
that there's that there, there, there aren't three, right?

896
00:45:42.695 --> 00:45:44.705
There's one and there are three persons,

897
00:45:44.705 --> 00:45:45.705
but there's one God.

898
00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:51.705
And so the, the, the power of God to do for those things

899
00:45:51.725 --> 00:45:53.305
to happen is the will of God.

900
00:45:54.005 --> 00:45:57.765
Um, he was able through his perfect faith

901
00:45:57.905 --> 00:45:59.805
to pray perfectly in the will of God.

902
00:46:00.745 --> 00:46:02.885
We don't have that ability 'cause our faith isn't perfect.

903
00:46:02.985 --> 00:46:06.445
We pray, we might pray for, for healing in a person

904
00:46:06.745 --> 00:46:09.605
or for, um, a change in a situation.

905
00:46:09.605 --> 00:46:11.045
But that's not God's will.

906
00:46:11.345 --> 00:46:14.005
And yet Jesus knew the perfect will of God

907
00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:16.925
and he perfectly submitted to God's will.

908
00:46:17.465 --> 00:46:19.005
And and we can say we submit to it.

909
00:46:19.005 --> 00:46:22.005
And yet we in our, in our flesh, it's, there's a,

910
00:46:22.715 --> 00:46:24.725
there's an imperfection in that.

911
00:46:25.505 --> 00:46:29.935
Um, and so when we see,

912
00:46:30.115 --> 00:46:32.095
and he promised that as we, as we pray

913
00:46:32.095 --> 00:46:34.895
and we ask in faith, the faith of a mustard seed, right?

914
00:46:35.285 --> 00:46:37.935
That those great things that the mountains would be moved

915
00:46:37.935 --> 00:46:39.815
and we would see the will of God at work

916
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:43.615
when we're in line with God's will.

917
00:46:43.635 --> 00:46:46.855
And so that we, we just don't know it.

918
00:46:46.995 --> 00:46:48.295
And yet he, he did know it

919
00:46:48.295 --> 00:46:49.535
that he was, he's in a cheat code.

920
00:46:49.555 --> 00:46:51.735
No, but it was natural because that was him.

921
00:46:52.475 --> 00:46:56.375
It wasn't like he wasn't, he was still God in the flesh.

922
00:46:56.515 --> 00:47:00.175
He was manifesting at, not in the, in the weird way, right?

923
00:47:00.175 --> 00:47:05.095
But he was displaying deity through flesh and,

924
00:47:05.275 --> 00:47:06.455
and perfection through flesh.

925
00:47:06.555 --> 00:47:07.615
And so he, yeah,

926
00:47:09.245 --> 00:47:10.245
Yeah. John 16, 24,

927
00:47:10.245 --> 00:47:12.375
until now, you've asked nothing in my name.

928
00:47:12.675 --> 00:47:14.855
Ask and you'll receive and your joy will be made complete.

929
00:47:15.285 --> 00:47:20.055
He's saying that to people. So he also says, um,

930
00:47:20.755 --> 00:47:22.495
in the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew seven,

931
00:47:22.495 --> 00:47:26.295
where he is talking about, you know, giving gifts based on,

932
00:47:26.315 --> 00:47:28.335
you know, I'm a good father, don't give snakes.

933
00:47:28.395 --> 00:47:30.885
And you know, you ask for a fish, they give you a serpent.

934
00:47:30.885 --> 00:47:33.525
And he, and he, he talks a number

935
00:47:33.525 --> 00:47:35.125
of times about asking Courtney God's will.

936
00:47:36.945 --> 00:47:38.485
So I, I think that was a good part, is

937
00:47:38.485 --> 00:47:40.565
that his human will is always submitted to the divine will.

938
00:47:40.565 --> 00:47:42.245
So he knew perfectly in every situation.

939
00:47:42.465 --> 00:47:45.725
But for us, we can assume in a moment

940
00:47:46.075 --> 00:47:49.005
that this is God's divine will for this person to be healed.

941
00:47:49.005 --> 00:47:51.165
For example, when we, we had in this church,

942
00:47:51.165 --> 00:47:52.445
James five, we pray for healing.

943
00:47:53.865 --> 00:47:55.885
We don't know if that's actually God's will in the moment.

944
00:47:57.145 --> 00:47:59.965
We, we pray that it is, we pray in faith that it is,

945
00:48:00.905 --> 00:48:02.325
but he perfectly understood

946
00:48:02.325 --> 00:48:04.205
and knew that it was in this moment.

947
00:48:04.365 --> 00:48:05.525
'cause he didn't heal everybody.

948
00:48:06.725 --> 00:48:08.385
He knew that this person and this person

949
00:48:08.445 --> 00:48:09.905
and this person out of the 15

950
00:48:10.255 --> 00:48:11.505
were the ones that he was gonna heal.

951
00:48:11.505 --> 00:48:13.745
And that would be the best for his kingdom purposes,

952
00:48:13.805 --> 00:48:16.265
for his glory to be shining brightly.

953
00:48:16.445 --> 00:48:17.705
Why was this man born blind?

954
00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:20.545
Well, so that the glory of God might be shown through him.

955
00:48:22.605 --> 00:48:25.505
We don't know that yet.

956
00:48:28.125 --> 00:48:32.705
We can't tie the miracle to merely his humanity

957
00:48:33.245 --> 00:48:37.905
either, because there are

958
00:48:37.905 --> 00:48:41.945
instances where somebody like Peter's shadow

959
00:48:42.535 --> 00:48:44.105
fell on this guy and he got healed, right?

960
00:48:44.105 --> 00:48:46.585
Like there's so, there's, there's something going on

961
00:48:46.735 --> 00:48:50.745
spiritually here that they get touched or a handkerchief

962
00:48:50.745 --> 00:48:53.425
or whatever it is, and things are, whoa, God's working.

963
00:48:54.605 --> 00:48:57.905
You can't attribute that to us, to humanity at all.

964
00:48:57.905 --> 00:48:59.665
That's only God's divine work.

965
00:49:01.045 --> 00:49:03.705
So even in the human will submitted to the divine will,

966
00:49:03.855 --> 00:49:07.825
he's still in a sense tapping into the power

967
00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:10.185
of God, who it is God.

968
00:49:10.205 --> 00:49:12.345
But, but as, as an illustration for us,

969
00:49:12.345 --> 00:49:13.625
tapping into the power of God

970
00:49:13.645 --> 00:49:15.225
to see something at work in us.

971
00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:19.105
So do we not pray with enough faith,

972
00:49:20.855 --> 00:49:22.745
mustard seed, mountains move?

973
00:49:22.965 --> 00:49:26.185
Do we not pray according to the will of God,

974
00:49:26.285 --> 00:49:27.585
as rightly as we should?

975
00:49:30.025 --> 00:49:31.525
That's why the scriptures matter,

976
00:49:31.525 --> 00:49:33.565
because this is the will of God, right?

977
00:49:33.585 --> 00:49:37.085
We, we know that he's already revealed to us these things.

978
00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:40.045
And so we, that's why on Thursdays when we meet

979
00:49:40.045 --> 00:49:43.005
for prayer at 12 on Thursdays we pray scripture,

980
00:49:43.775 --> 00:49:46.725
we're just praying verses we're praying Bible passages.

981
00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:51.325
'cause this is what God said he's going to do Now, when

982
00:49:51.325 --> 00:49:52.565
and how that's up to him.

983
00:49:52.625 --> 00:49:54.605
But for this situation, I look at this,

984
00:49:54.685 --> 00:49:56.485
I think this passage, I'm gonna pray that.

985
00:49:57.745 --> 00:50:00.365
And that's where I think we can trust that God will work

986
00:50:02.155 --> 00:50:05.725
when we have the faith growing for what he wants.

987
00:50:06.585 --> 00:50:08.365
Divine will delight yourself in the Lord.

988
00:50:08.365 --> 00:50:09.525
He'll give you the desires of your heart.

989
00:50:09.525 --> 00:50:13.485
Psalm 37, 4, the key is delight yourself in the Lord.

990
00:50:13.495 --> 00:50:14.685
He'll give you the desires of your heart

991
00:50:14.685 --> 00:50:17.485
because he's gonna change your desires to what he wants.

992
00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:20.405
He'll answer those according to his will.

993
00:50:21.935 --> 00:50:22.965
Great questions, Jeff.

994
00:50:23.075 --> 00:50:27.765
Anybody else or else?

995
00:50:27.765 --> 00:50:29.685
We're just gonna have to keep riffing it. I dunno. Off top.

996
00:50:32.395 --> 00:50:33.725
Okay, we got it right here.

997
00:50:37.675 --> 00:50:40.035
Probably don't, we probably won't have time tonight to

998
00:50:41.115 --> 00:50:43.115
probably approach this too much,

999
00:50:43.255 --> 00:50:46.875
but the, uh, Westminster confession of faith

1000
00:50:48.375 --> 00:50:52.675
and God's ordination of sin, are we gonna approach those?

1001
00:50:53.135 --> 00:50:56.795
Uh, because it really ties into this discussion tonight, uh,

1002
00:50:56.945 --> 00:50:59.995
very much in terms of what was the purpose.

1003
00:51:00.855 --> 00:51:04.435
And the only thing I can come up with is

1004
00:51:05.385 --> 00:51:09.885
tied back to the two greatest commandments and that's love.

1005
00:51:09.985 --> 00:51:14.685
And that we have a choice to love God and love people.

1006
00:51:16.465 --> 00:51:19.125
And that decision requires the will

1007
00:51:20.265 --> 00:51:23.295
or the choice of

1008
00:51:24.135 --> 00:51:25.775
sinning or loving.

1009
00:51:27.415 --> 00:51:29.825
Yeah. And so that's a deep subject,

1010
00:51:29.925 --> 00:51:32.065
but are we gonna approach that at some point?

1011
00:51:32.135 --> 00:51:36.065
Yeah. This Sunday actually, it's uh, it's a perfect segue.

1012
00:51:36.325 --> 00:51:38.945
So this, this Sunday's topic is humanity.

1013
00:51:40.045 --> 00:51:44.225
So we've gone from revelation to God, attributes,

1014
00:51:44.225 --> 00:51:45.585
Trinity, God, the Son.

1015
00:51:46.485 --> 00:51:47.665
Now it's about humanity.

1016
00:51:48.135 --> 00:51:51.345
Like we need to understand humans, mankind

1017
00:51:52.765 --> 00:51:53.945
in what God has said.

1018
00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:55.825
And that's a foundational rock.

1019
00:51:56.615 --> 00:51:58.625
Because sin,

1020
00:51:58.935 --> 00:52:01.985
because image bearers,

1021
00:52:02.015 --> 00:52:03.105
because identity,

1022
00:52:03.885 --> 00:52:06.185
you look at what's our world all about right now,

1023
00:52:06.185 --> 00:52:09.225
like you can see how this is a foundational rock for us

1024
00:52:09.225 --> 00:52:10.985
because then we understand why are we here,

1025
00:52:11.255 --> 00:52:12.265
what are we created for?

1026
00:52:12.725 --> 00:52:16.585
How do we relate to God, what went wrong? All of that.

1027
00:52:17.085 --> 00:52:18.145
So we'll get that this Sunday

1028
00:52:18.165 --> 00:52:20.505
and actually the next week too, the next week is salvation.

1029
00:52:21.365 --> 00:52:25.465
And we're gonna talk about just what is salvation like?

1030
00:52:25.465 --> 00:52:26.745
So these are big rocks, right?

1031
00:52:26.745 --> 00:52:28.985
These are really key, key elements.

1032
00:52:29.005 --> 00:52:31.305
But one thing I just as a preview for this Sunday,

1033
00:52:32.175 --> 00:52:33.945
there's boy, it's a Latin term.

1034
00:52:34.065 --> 00:52:36.425
I have to, I've got on my notes over there,

1035
00:52:36.565 --> 00:52:41.225
but there's this progression of

1036
00:52:43.275 --> 00:52:46.405
like, I'm gonna mess it up so I'll get it right Sunday.

1037
00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:50.535
But like, there's a progression of

1038
00:52:51.405 --> 00:52:53.775
when you look at the fall and Jesus,

1039
00:52:53.955 --> 00:52:58.535
and there was a time where we were able not

1040
00:52:58.535 --> 00:53:01.555
to sin and then

1041
00:53:01.555 --> 00:53:04.155
after the fall we're not able not to sin.

1042
00:53:06.435 --> 00:53:10.575
Jesus was not able to sin in a sense.

1043
00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:15.335
So one day we're again able to not sin.

1044
00:53:16.245 --> 00:53:18.255
There's some kind of like progression along the way

1045
00:53:18.255 --> 00:53:21.335
and it's all these Latin words, simul, tus

1046
00:53:21.355 --> 00:53:23.175
and like, it's just long things.

1047
00:53:23.315 --> 00:53:25.765
But, but that's sort of the idea is

1048
00:53:25.765 --> 00:53:27.445
that when the fall happened, when sin came,

1049
00:53:27.575 --> 00:53:29.165
we're not able not to sin anymore.

1050
00:53:30.065 --> 00:53:33.765
But Jesus without the seed was able not to sin

1051
00:53:33.985 --> 00:53:36.005
and was actually not able to sin

1052
00:53:36.565 --> 00:53:37.805
'cause of the divine nature in a way.

1053
00:53:37.905 --> 00:53:40.845
So you can see that there's, there's a sense of him

1054
00:53:41.355 --> 00:53:43.725
restoring what was originally created

1055
00:53:44.745 --> 00:53:47.965
and remaking us into that image which we originally created

1056
00:53:48.025 --> 00:53:51.325
to reflect now perfectly will again, someday just

1057
00:53:51.925 --> 00:53:53.245
progressively better now.

1058
00:53:54.025 --> 00:53:57.285
So that, that's a long rambling towards that,

1059
00:53:57.305 --> 00:53:58.765
but we'll get there Sunday a little more directly.

1060
00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:03.705
Good. Okay.

1061
00:54:03.845 --> 00:54:06.265
So nobody else has a question. Last question.

1062
00:54:07.325 --> 00:54:10.685
Why does this matter? Why, why does this,

1063
00:54:10.745 --> 00:54:13.205
why is the incarnation such an, why is it a big rock?

1064
00:54:13.265 --> 00:54:16.205
Why is it so important? Why do we need to grow,

1065
00:54:16.205 --> 00:54:17.805
like Jeff saying grow in our understanding of this?

1066
00:54:17.805 --> 00:54:21.085
What is, what's so important about this that it really is

1067
00:54:21.705 --> 00:54:24.765
so mysterious, the trinity and this so mysterious,

1068
00:54:24.785 --> 00:54:27.485
but what, okay, what's the point

1069
00:54:27.485 --> 00:54:28.885
of us understanding this idea better?

1070
00:54:29.435 --> 00:54:34.165
Well, I mean it's So many.

1071
00:54:34.195 --> 00:54:37.525
Well first of all, it the way, when we marvel

1072
00:54:37.745 --> 00:54:38.845
and we think deeply

1073
00:54:39.305 --> 00:54:44.005
and we, we approach the end of what we can understand

1074
00:54:44.315 --> 00:54:47.525
with our minds and step into faith about

1075
00:54:47.595 --> 00:54:49.605
what God's word said in the miraculous

1076
00:54:51.775 --> 00:54:52.805
hypostatic nature

1077
00:54:52.825 --> 00:54:56.365
and union of Christ, it glorifies God in our own minds.

1078
00:54:57.545 --> 00:55:01.565
It also sets us apart as Christ followers.

1079
00:55:02.035 --> 00:55:06.405
Like Jesus coming, God, coming to earth

1080
00:55:06.405 --> 00:55:09.885
to take on flesh is what sets Christianity apart.

1081
00:55:10.035 --> 00:55:12.965
It's what makes our faith, the faith, the faith

1082
00:55:12.965 --> 00:55:17.765
that he has given to us a true faith, a true saving faith.

1083
00:55:18.425 --> 00:55:22.445
And so to understand the truth about that

1084
00:55:23.305 --> 00:55:28.155
allows us to not only glorify God

1085
00:55:28.345 --> 00:55:29.875
with our minds and with our hearts,

1086
00:55:30.015 --> 00:55:33.235
but also to speak well to other people about it.

1087
00:55:33.295 --> 00:55:35.035
And to understand that he is the way,

1088
00:55:35.255 --> 00:55:36.475
the truth and the life.

1089
00:55:36.495 --> 00:55:38.355
And no one comes through the Father, except through him.

1090
00:55:38.355 --> 00:55:41.115
And why is that? That's because he is the father

1091
00:55:41.135 --> 00:55:42.915
and he came to earth and he was the only one.

1092
00:55:43.335 --> 00:55:45.995
That's one of the things we talk about when we, when we walk

1093
00:55:45.995 --> 00:55:48.395
with, uh, deacons going through the process.

1094
00:55:48.505 --> 00:55:50.475
They, we, we have all our deacons that are in the,

1095
00:55:50.475 --> 00:55:54.035
in the candidate process, do a doctrinal question list.

1096
00:55:54.335 --> 00:55:56.275
And one of the questions about the hypothetic union,

1097
00:55:56.275 --> 00:55:58.835
it's one that everybody, we, we kind of smile about

1098
00:55:59.065 --> 00:56:01.275
because it's to, to write that out

1099
00:56:01.275 --> 00:56:03.395
and think about that is good and it's hard,

1100
00:56:03.395 --> 00:56:08.235
but it's, it's what allows us to be redeemed to our creator

1101
00:56:08.695 --> 00:56:10.035
and restore into our creator.

1102
00:56:10.375 --> 00:56:12.995
And without the incarnation, without a true

1103
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:14.195
and right understanding of it,

1104
00:56:14.195 --> 00:56:16.235
if we step off into the ditch on either side,

1105
00:56:17.825 --> 00:56:18.955
then it doesn't work out.

1106
00:56:20.255 --> 00:56:24.445
And so if, if Christ, uh, hadn't perfectly,

1107
00:56:24.495 --> 00:56:25.845
fully taken on flesh

1108
00:56:25.905 --> 00:56:30.525
and wasn't a true, wasn't truly in the flesh, then he,

1109
00:56:30.705 --> 00:56:32.005
he, he wouldn't have been able

1110
00:56:32.005 --> 00:56:33.845
to fully make the sacrifice for our sins.

1111
00:56:33.845 --> 00:56:35.805
And if he wasn't perfect, it wouldn't have been a complete

1112
00:56:36.245 --> 00:56:37.805
sacrifice for our sins

1113
00:56:37.805 --> 00:56:42.485
and it wouldn't have fully, um, Satisfied

1114
00:56:42.485 --> 00:56:45.445
or made atonement for God's wrath, made atonement

1115
00:56:45.445 --> 00:56:46.885
for our sin in God's wrath and been our

1116
00:56:46.885 --> 00:56:47.925
perfect propitiation.

1117
00:56:47.945 --> 00:56:51.885
And so to, to understand it well, to be able to speak well

1118
00:56:51.885 --> 00:56:53.485
of it inside and understand it,

1119
00:56:53.485 --> 00:56:55.965
but then to speak well of others, allows to others,

1120
00:56:56.025 --> 00:56:59.605
allows us to, to make that distinction where, um,

1121
00:56:59.745 --> 00:57:00.965
others might be.

1122
00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:04.885
Uh, if, if you don't have a complete understanding, then um,

1123
00:57:05.345 --> 00:57:09.485
you can deceive, you can be deceived, I think

1124
00:57:10.155 --> 00:57:14.045
into, into, into a, a false teaching, a false religion

1125
00:57:14.045 --> 00:57:15.805
or something short of what the true gospel is.

1126
00:57:17.275 --> 00:57:18.845
Yeah, one of the, this goes

1127
00:57:18.845 --> 00:57:20.205
to last week a little bit too with the Trinity.

1128
00:57:20.305 --> 00:57:24.365
One of the realities in our day is trying to humanize Jesus

1129
00:57:24.545 --> 00:57:27.565
so much because we want him to relate to us

1130
00:57:28.395 --> 00:57:29.805
like we want to relate to him.

1131
00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:32.325
We want him to feel what we feel.

1132
00:57:33.145 --> 00:57:36.885
And it even pulls God down a little bit too in the trinity.

1133
00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:40.605
But why should we want him to, to be a buddy?

1134
00:57:40.665 --> 00:57:45.325
We can hug and in a sense he is that

1135
00:57:46.525 --> 00:57:48.095
he's the guy who came near to us,

1136
00:57:49.845 --> 00:57:51.825
but he's not, he's not just that either.

1137
00:57:52.765 --> 00:57:56.745
And so we can't humanize Jesus so much

1138
00:57:56.775 --> 00:58:00.665
that we miss out on the fact that he is both God and man

1139
00:58:00.845 --> 00:58:03.745
and, and all that God is.

1140
00:58:04.285 --> 00:58:05.385
He still is.

1141
00:58:05.605 --> 00:58:09.065
And so, yes, that is the beauty of it,

1142
00:58:09.335 --> 00:58:13.065
that he is able to just like in the gospels,

1143
00:58:13.065 --> 00:58:15.065
so many people just coming up to him and hugging him

1144
00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:17.065
and like just sitting with him

1145
00:58:17.085 --> 00:58:19.545
and John leaning against him at the table

1146
00:58:19.805 --> 00:58:24.595
and whoa, yet the God

1147
00:58:24.595 --> 00:58:26.235
of the universe, right?

1148
00:58:26.535 --> 00:58:30.715
That's, that's him. So in the desire, this is

1149
00:58:30.715 --> 00:58:32.875
where we get in the ditches, in the desire to humanize him,

1150
00:58:32.895 --> 00:58:35.835
we can pull him down from where he actually is

1151
00:58:36.175 --> 00:58:37.475
and we don't, we don't want that.

1152
00:58:38.655 --> 00:58:42.195
He could be both like we, we go either or so often.

1153
00:58:42.215 --> 00:58:44.835
He could be both and it can, it can work out.

1154
00:58:45.735 --> 00:58:47.315
All right, so we got some resources down here.

1155
00:58:47.395 --> 00:58:49.275
I wasn't here last week. Uh, thank you guys

1156
00:58:49.295 --> 00:58:50.355
for taking care of that.

1157
00:58:50.575 --> 00:58:53.475
Um, this one on your right,

1158
00:58:53.705 --> 00:58:56.755
this stack over there is the Trinity resources.

1159
00:58:56.975 --> 00:58:59.835
So there's a lot of books there that you can, uh,

1160
00:59:00.175 --> 00:59:01.995
you can take a look at that would be

1161
00:59:01.995 --> 00:59:03.555
helpful a lot by Fred Sanders.

1162
00:59:03.635 --> 00:59:04.635
I mentioned him in the email.

1163
00:59:05.175 --> 00:59:07.715
He is the foremost scholar on Trinity right now.

1164
00:59:07.855 --> 00:59:10.595
So that side is about the trinity

1165
00:59:10.815 --> 00:59:15.275
and this side over here, this on the left is the, uh,

1166
00:59:15.975 --> 00:59:19.235
god, the son, the incarnate resources that you might, uh,

1167
00:59:19.265 --> 00:59:20.755
want to take a glance at and,

1168
00:59:20.945 --> 00:59:22.325
and purchase if you want to,

1169
00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:25.605
somewhere at your favorite bookstore online usually.

1170
00:59:25.825 --> 00:59:28.805
So, um, that's that. So come take a look at those.

1171
00:59:29.415 --> 00:59:31.085
We'll be around asking questions,

1172
00:59:31.305 --> 00:59:34.205
but, uh, we gotta be done here as the worship team

1173
00:59:35.025 --> 00:59:37.005
begins there evening after us.

1174
00:59:37.385 --> 00:59:41.045
So lemme pray for us. God, thank you so much for your grace

1175
00:59:41.865 --> 00:59:46.285
and love exemplified in the incarnation

1176
00:59:47.385 --> 00:59:51.845
for God so loved, not just loved in such a magnitude way,

1177
00:59:51.945 --> 00:59:54.165
but God loved the world in this way.

1178
00:59:54.625 --> 00:59:56.645
So like this kind of way

1179
00:59:57.825 --> 01:00:01.565
for God loved the world in this way that he sent his son

1180
01:00:02.435 --> 01:00:04.165
only begotten the beloved

1181
01:00:08.475 --> 01:00:10.925
That whoever believes would not perish

1182
01:00:10.925 --> 01:00:12.045
but have everlasting life.

1183
01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:20.475
Lord, I thank you for that love. You are love.

1184
01:00:24.325 --> 01:00:28.425
And so remind us even tonight, how, how good

1185
01:00:28.975 --> 01:00:33.405
that love is yet how mysterious

1186
01:00:34.675 --> 01:00:36.845
that it took God man

1187
01:00:40.155 --> 01:00:43.335
to, to make it a reality where we could be

1188
01:00:43.925 --> 01:00:47.735
delivered from our sin and made sons and daughters.

1189
01:00:52.575 --> 01:00:54.195
So that is true.

1190
01:00:54.415 --> 01:00:58.955
God, we should be so stunned by this doctrine,

1191
01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.395
of course, the mystery of it,

1192
01:01:00.695 --> 01:01:04.195
but so stunned by the, the truth of the gospel.

1193
01:01:08.425 --> 01:01:13.165
Jesus Christ, our Lord shed his blood

1194
01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:16.125
to cover our sin

1195
01:01:16.225 --> 01:01:20.125
and to take us one day home with you forever.

1196
01:01:26.075 --> 01:01:28.605
Guys, we look at in a couple weeks, we, we look forward

1197
01:01:28.705 --> 01:01:32.725
to the day whenever Jesus Christ

1198
01:01:33.825 --> 01:01:35.565
splits open the eastern sky

1199
01:01:35.865 --> 01:01:40.005
and walks into this heaven's and earth

1200
01:01:40.265 --> 01:01:43.045
and remakes it into the new heavens and new earth

1201
01:01:43.305 --> 01:01:47.565
and makes us new and takes us home.

1202
01:01:53.295 --> 01:01:57.185
Everything that you are on

1203
01:01:57.185 --> 01:01:59.305
that day, you are right now.

1204
01:02:00.765 --> 01:02:03.905
You were from before ages passed.

1205
01:02:06.365 --> 01:02:08.785
You're the same yesterday, today and forever, Jesus.

1206
01:02:10.925 --> 01:02:14.185
And it is a mystery how that looks with a person

1207
01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.705
here on earth for those 33 years.

1208
01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:22.165
But God that stirs worship.

1209
01:02:25.235 --> 01:02:29.455
So help us to speak well of these things

1210
01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:31.415
that are mysterious

1211
01:02:34.195 --> 01:02:36.935
to understand even just one step to tonight,

1212
01:02:37.515 --> 01:02:42.215
one step forward, that you would be more

1213
01:02:43.845 --> 01:02:47.975
supreme in our affections, in our hearts, our loves,

1214
01:02:48.275 --> 01:02:51.975
our desires, that our desire would be

1215
01:02:52.555 --> 01:02:55.015
for your will to be done just like it was for Jesus.

1216
01:02:59.725 --> 01:03:01.615
Even when that means it's hard

1217
01:03:03.395 --> 01:03:07.135
and it's a weight your will be done on

1218
01:03:07.135 --> 01:03:08.375
earth as it is in heaven.

1219
01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:13.205
Help us, God, holy Spirit, you,

1220
01:03:13.825 --> 01:03:15.645
you are in us as believers.

1221
01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:18.845
You bring about a

1222
01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:23.665
growth, this perfection of faith,

1223
01:03:25.765 --> 01:03:28.745
and to bring confidence, to bring assurance.

1224
01:03:32.065 --> 01:03:37.005
Remind us daily of these truths for your glory.

1225
01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:40.405
And in Jesus' authority we pray. Amen.
