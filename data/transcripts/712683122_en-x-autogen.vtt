00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.100
here

2
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.400
Well, good morning again Church. My name is John and I get the

3
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.200
privilege to service Lee teaching Pastor here. If you are new, I'd love to meet you.

4
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.200
Just come say hi after I love doing that connecting with

5
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.400
you. We are finishing up a short Series today on

6
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.300
the spiritual disciplines those habits in our

7
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.400
lives that increase our love for Jesus and also make

8
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.200
us more like Jesus. That's the point not just to have

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
something we do regularly on our calendar but to make us

10
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
like him and today we're talking about giving

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.800
It's been said that if you want to know what someone really values check

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.600
two things their calendar and their

13
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.900
bank account.

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
You can see what someone values by those two

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.600
things which is one reason many people get uncomfortable when

16
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.100
we talk about money in the church because it

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.200
affects us to the deepest parts of

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.100
who we are it touches those core decisions and

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100
motivations.

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.900
It's also why we protect ourselves and and self-justify while

21
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.300
we avoid to give.

22
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700
But here's what I hope as we study what God says here

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.400
about giving what what makes us more

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
like Jesus as we give what I hope you see today is

25
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.300
that giving is one evidence that God's grace is

26
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.200
at work in your heart.

27
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.200
That's the the hope I have that you walk away with that

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.700
is it giving is one evidence?

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.500
That God's grace is at work in your heart.

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.000
Now if you're here and you don't believe in Jesus yet first, let me

31
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.800
say thank you for being here. Keep coming back keep asking questions.

32
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.900
But this sermon is primarily for believers.

33
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.400
Those who have received the grace of God in

34
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.300
our hearts that it can be working in us. So

35
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.400
just listen. I hope you see Jesus in all of this today, of

36
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.500
course, but but realize let's think about that as we

37
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.600
think through this. This is for us who are believers.

38
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500
And so if you're not already there take your copy of God's word and turn

39
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.300
with me to Second Corinthians.

40
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.200
Ryan preached so well last week from First Corinthians. This

41
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.300
is the next letter Paul wrote to this

42
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.300
church in Corinth.

43
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.000
Now every time we read God's word are we study it? We need to understand it's context.

44
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.500
So as you're turning there, let me give you a little bit background here

45
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.400
because we need to know what's going on. Help us understand how we are to

46
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.300
read this especially in this these two chapters of

47
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.700
chapters 8 and 9 of 2nd Corinthians. What was happening behind

48
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.500
the scenes that leads us to now what we're

49
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.000
reading.

50
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.300
So what was happening was on the Apostle Paul's third missionary journey,

51
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.500
which we saw when we went through acts last year. We were watching him

52
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.400
take these long Journeys around the Mediterranean.

53
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.100
On his third Journey one of his tasks was

54
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.800
to collect a relief offering for the impoverished Christians back

55
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.800
around Jerusalem where they had originally started, of

56
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.700
course the church there and they're sending missionaries all over there were

57
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.500
still some left and they were impoverished because they were

58
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
being persecuted for their faith. They were

59
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.900
being kicked out of their family in many cases losing jobs. They were

60
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
really feeling cast out of society in

61
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.500
some ways. And so Paul was concerned to meet

62
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.100
their physical needs. Yes, but also he had an ulterior

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.700
motive in this relief offering

64
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.500
As I said, they'd sent missionaries to plant churches all

65
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.500
over the Gentile world the non-jewish background World. Well

66
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.200
Paul wanted to strengthen the unity between

67
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.100
the Gentile background Believers and the Jewish background Believers. He

68
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.600
wanted to tie those to together. So this

69
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.100
offering was part of that.

70
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.000
Here's the problem. He's addressing in Corinthians, though.

71
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.900
the Corinthian Church

72
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.200
We're not doing their part.

73
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.800
In giving what they'd promised to give.

74
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.600
A year earlier they had said we're going to do this. We're going to give and

75
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.100
they just hadn't done it yet. So he's writing this part of

76
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.400
this letter to them for that reason.

77
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.200
What he does, is he elevates his appeal to the highest

78
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.500
spiritual level possible.

79
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.500
He says here in synchronization nine that that giving is

80
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.900
an act of Grace.

81
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.700
Giving is actually an act of Grace. He used a few different words throughout to

82
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.400
refer to this offering he's talking about and the most he

83
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.600
used was the word grace for the offering.

84
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.800
This is Grace to give like this.

85
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.200
That's why I said giving us one evidence that God's grace is at work in your heart.

86
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.500
That the Lord has so transformed you.

87
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.800
that you can't help but give

88
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.500
and you can't help but give that's what this passage

89
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.800
will show us.

90
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.500
What it looks like for your giving to be motivated by God's grace.

91
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.100
That's what we want. It's not just because somebody told you

92
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.300
to because you feel like you're supposed to it's because it's motivated From

93
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.100
the Inside Out by God's grace.

94
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.600
So how do we know it is? What are some signs? We know giving us

95
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.600
motivated by Grace first. It's when you give in spite of circumstances.

96
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.300
We know it's motivated by God's grace when you give

97
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.300
in spite of circumstances.

98
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.300
This is chapter 8 look at verses 1 through 4

99
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.200
to start with we're just going to work through the whole Passage.

100
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.800
It says we want you to know brothers. That's the church in Corinth about

101
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.500
the grace of God that's been among the churches of Macedonia.

102
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.000
That's a whole different area of the world.

103
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.300
For in a severe test of Affliction their Abundance

104
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.600
of Joy, they're extreme poverty have overflowed in

105
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.600
a wealth of generosity on their part.

106
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.400
For they gave according to their means as I can testify and beyond their

107
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.500
means of their own accord begging us earnestly for

108
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.100
the favor of taking part in the relief of the

109
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.700
Saints.

110
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.000
So notice what Paul's doing here?

111
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.400
Again, he wants to motivate the Corinthian Church to

112
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.600
give.

113
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.800
And he referenced the churches in Macedonia.

114
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.700
And those churches in Macedonia had given in a

115
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.200
severe test of affliction.

116
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.200
What was that test? Well, it was that they were experiencing extreme poverty.

117
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.300
Like they had hit rock bottom. They had very little

118
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.700
of anything and they had very little hope of getting anything.

119
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.300
They were as poor as you can get.

120
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.800
But did that hinder them from giving?

121
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.600
No.

122
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.300
This is in fact, they gave joyfully they gave abundantly they

123
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.400
gave what they could and they gave plus some they gave

124
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.500
beyond their means.

125
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.000
Why?

126
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.200
verse 1

127
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.500
because of the grace of God that had been given to them.

128
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800
It was the grace of God that was leading them

129
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.300
to even beg. It says for the

130
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.600
favor the grace.

131
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.700
Of getting to take part in this offering. How often do you see people begging

132
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.500
to give right?

133
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.500
These people are saying we want to give I know we're poor but we want to give and

134
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.700
they weren't giving out a guilt. They weren't giving out of pressure their

135
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.400
desire to give was because of God's grace inside of

136
00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.600
them.

137
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.000
so changing their heart that they couldn't help but want to give

138
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.600
Listen, we will rarely look at our circumstances and

139
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.700
see the inspiration to

140
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.900
give.

141
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.200
Right. There's always going to be more bills coming. There's always

142
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.300
going to be future plans. There's the numbers won't add up.

143
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.400
There's you just lost a job or medical bill comes

144
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.000
in like there's always going to be that but when you have experienced the

145
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.500
matchless grace of God,

146
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.600
in your life

147
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.400
Then difficult times. Stop being an excuse not

148
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.700
to give

149
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.900
When you give according to God's grace

150
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.300
not in your circumstances, that doesn't

151
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.700
affect it. That's when you know God's grace is at work in your heart.

152
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.600
Second we know you're giving is motivated by God's grace when you give excellently.

153
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.400
As we continue through his letter here when you give

154
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.600
excellently. We see that's by God's grace. It's motivating

155
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.800
you.

156
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.700
This is verses 5 through 7.

157
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.700
Talking still about the Macedonian Church. He says this not

158
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.300
as we expected but they gave themselves first to

159
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.200
the Lord then by the will of God to us.

160
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.200
Accordingly we urged Titus that as he had started so he

161
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.900
should complete among you this act of Grace.

162
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.700
But as you excel in everything in faith

163
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.600
and speech and knowledge in all earnestness in

164
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.300
our love for you see that you excel in

165
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.500
this act of Grace also.

166
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.600
Saw that word excel a couple times right that word means abundant or excessive

167
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.000
or more than enough.

168
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.500
and so Paul wrote this to them saying not only

169
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.700
are you two go above and beyond in your Holiness in

170
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.700
your life in the way you speak the way you act the way you love

171
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.900
one another not only go above and beyond that way excel

172
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.900
in this act of Grace called giving

173
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.300
excel in giving as well over

174
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.300
the top abundantly.

175
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.600
But again notice, let's tie it back what it said earlier.

176
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.900
This pursuit of Excellence is grounded in verse 5 where

177
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.500
it says they gave themselves first to the

178
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.900
Lord and then by the will of God to us.

179
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.500
That they're giving was a response to God's

180
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.500
grace that they were responding to the gospel first,

181
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.000
and then they gave to everyone else around them.

182
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.500
So at First Corinthians 10:31 says

183
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.300
whether you eat or drink, whatever you do do all to the

184
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.000
glory of God.

185
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.500
Even giving must be first to him.

186
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.600
and then to others

187
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.300
because here's the reality.

188
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.500
He's saying this to them that if they have already given

189
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.700
them their whole selves to God.

190
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.200
If they've already given their whole selves to God, it's not hard

191
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.400
to give stuff or money or time to God so

192
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.500
that he receives more Glory.

193
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.400
It's already all his.

194
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.800
And so I'm gonna give it away.

195
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.100
But that's where excellent giving comes from.

196
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.500
That yes others receive benefits when we give but ultimately

197
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.400
we are giving to the Lord first we are doing it

198
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.400
for him first. And so when you think about it that way do we

199
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.000
really want to do that half-heartedly?

200
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.100
If we're giving to him, we want to kind of

201
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.300
Half Baked that right and just don't do it all in right?

202
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.800
We're giving to the Lord first. That means we will do it. Excellently.

203
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.000
We see an example of that.

204
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.800
from Jesus himself

205
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.500
The whole point of spiritual disciplines is to become more like Jesus, right? We see

206
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.300
an example of his kind of giving right here that

207
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.600
that our giving is driven by God's grace when we give as

208
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.500
Jesus gave

209
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.600
we start to see how he gave to us when we

210
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.300
start to give away like he did then it starts

211
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.000
to show up as motivated by grace.

212
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.300
Continuing chapter 8 look at verse 8.

213
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.500
I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of

214
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.500
others that your love also is genuine. Meaning

215
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.200
that the love of God is inside you that

216
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.600
giving is an illustration what he's already done inside you.

217
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.800
You're proving it by your generosity.

218
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.300
verse 9 for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ

219
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.200
that though he was rich yet for your sake he

220
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.600
became poor so that you buy his poverty might become rich

221
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.500
All this is doing is pointing us back to the gospel again, right?

222
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.300
You see how this all comes back to Grace.

223
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.400
It points us to Philippians 2, which says that

224
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.200
that though he was in the form of God. He did

225
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.200
not count equality with God a thing to be grasped or held on

226
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.400
to but he emptied himself taking on form of a servant

227
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.200
born in the likeness of men being found in human form.

228
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.900
He humbled himself further by becoming obedient to the point of death even

229
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.100
death on a cross.

230
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.600
Did you see what happened Jesus gave sacrificially? No strings

231
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.200
attached. He said I am going to give everything for

232
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.100
you. Why?

233
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.700
Because he loves us.

234
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.100
Because he wants to give good gifts to his children.

235
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.200
Because he wants to make us rich in his family.

236
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.800
By adopting Us in right?

237
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.500
Now listen that inheritance he's talking about right there has nothing to

238
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.400
do with with financial wealth.

239
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.300
It has everything to do with spiritual wealth.

240
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.400
Right. That's what he's talking about here that Jesus Took on

241
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.400
our sin poverty in a sense.

242
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.700
So that those who repent and believe in him could

243
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.000
receive the wealth of his righteousness.

244
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.700
It's a spiritual transaction a spiritual inheritance that we have the

245
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.400
ability now where we couldn't before now we

246
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.400
can stand before God completely perfect forever and

247
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.800
ever.

248
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.800
We were poor now. We're rich in him.

249
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.100
That's our example now.

250
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.600
Jesus gave sacrificially for

251
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.900
us spiritually

252
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.500
that his life death and Resurrection completely given

253
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.900
everything away setting aside all of that giving it

254
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.600
away here because he gave

255
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.100
we are to give sacrificially for others as well.

256
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.600
With everything we are time Talent resources

257
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.300
all of that. Yes, including financially.

258
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.300
Because he's writing second Corinthians 8 and 9

259
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.400
in the context of a financial gift.

260
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.200
So he's saying this is part of the deal we are to

261
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.000
give to each other.

262
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.400
Give to the Lord first and to each other financially.

263
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.600
We give as Jesus gave.

264
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.400
There's another evidence we find here God's grace

265
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.300
transforming your heart.

266
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.300
when you give willingly

267
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.600
when you give willingly

268
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.300
it's how you know God's motivating it.

269
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.200
back in second Corinthians 8 look at verses 10

270
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.600
through 12

271
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.400
He says in this matter, I give my judgment this benefits

272
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.300
you who a year ago started not only to do this work, but

273
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.500
also to desire to do it.

274
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.300
So now finished doing it as well. So your Readiness

275
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.000
and Desiring it maybe matched by your completing it out of what you have.

276
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.200
For if the Readiness is there it's acceptable according to what a person has

277
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.400
not according to what he does not have.

278
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.200
So there's a couple aspects of this first notice that this

279
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.000
kind of giving he's talking about here. As I said with willingly. It

280
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.400
must not be and cannot truly

281
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.600
be coerced.

282
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.600
He's talking about giving that is desired you're ready

283
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.200
for it. Right? Those words are not coerced words.

284
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.800
Those are willing words.

285
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.200
In other words, you should not give just because somebody stood up

286
00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.300
here and guilt tripped you.

287
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.200
It's not coerced. It's not pulled out of you. This

288
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.300
is a willing desire. But also catch this part

289
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.100
of it. It must not just be willingness.

290
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.400
There must also be a doing-ness. It's not

291
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.600
even a word. I don't know but it's like you see what I mean.

292
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.200
Willingness must be matched by a

293
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.800
follow through doing it.

294
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.200
Can't just want to you actually need to do

295
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.400
it.

296
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.000
Now I want to clarify something at this point and I

297
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.000
love how verse 12 actually did it already for me. So we're

298
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.800
going to look at it again.

299
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.700
See some people hear all of this.

300
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.400
When they hear somebody stand up in church and start talking about money. We're here

301
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.300
sermon on like this read through segregate and we start

302
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.700
to think

303
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.800
You can start to think that if I don't give a lot

304
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.200
of money, it doesn't count.

305
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.500
So what you're telling me is I got to give a whole lot for God

306
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:52.900
to notice.

307
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.700
Look at how verse 12 says it though.

308
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.800
He says it's according to what you have not

309
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.600
what you don't have.

310
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.300
He's not judging you on some standard of somebody else or comparing it

311
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.500
anybody else. It's it's what you have you are to give according to

312
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.500
what God has entrusted to you right now.

313
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.400
Not even what you had before what you will have in the future. What do

314
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.400
you have right now? This is the illustration Jesus

315
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.900
gave about the Widow in Luke 21.

316
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.600
Remember that story?

317
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.400
Jesus in the temple, he's watching people come and give

318
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.300
and he notices this Widow and he tells this this is Luke 21.

319
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.400
This Widow who?

320
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.300
in that Society

321
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.400
know that was was pretty hopeless.

322
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.600
A widow who might have had no

323
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.600
income might have been a beggar at times a widow who

324
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.400
was cast out a society in many cases. This

325
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.300
is the the scene that he's watching in the temple that Jesus

326
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.400
looked up and he saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box.

327
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.800
And he saw a poor Widow put in two small copper coins

328
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800
like pennies.

329
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.400
And Jesus said truly I tell you this poor Widow

330
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.700
has put in more than all of them.

331
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.400
For they all contributed out of their abundance meaning

332
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.200
just whatever they had left over extra all the money

333
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.400
that they made but she out of her poverty put

334
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.000
in all she had to live on.

335
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.300
What a step of Faith, right?

336
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.700
It's an illustration of what it's been said elsewhere that God sees

337
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.500
not the portion but the proportion.

338
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.400
in other words he's seeing

339
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.200
your heart

340
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.100
whether you have a lot whether you give a lot or whether you have a little and you

341
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.600
give a little comparatively he sees your heart.

342
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.200
And that's a scary thought because God then just think about that

343
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.200
God knows if you could have given more and you didn't.

344
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.000
But also the encouragement here the encouragement in that too.

345
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.300
that God knows if you wanted to give more but

346
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:08.600
you couldn't

347
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.100
just right now this medical bill came in

348
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.300
and we just can't make it right now. We're literally not going to put food

349
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.100
on the table. And yeah, I want to give God I want

350
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.400
to give more I want to do this.

351
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.400
That's why when we're talking about Grace giving we're not talking about a certain

352
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400
minimum percentage.

353
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.300
And it's like a bill that just comes out of your checking account

354
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.200
every and you just got this money going out and that's all it is. You like you're

355
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.500
checking another box. That's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about God stirring

356
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.500
Your Heart by his grace like

357
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.300
in Exodus 35 and 36 when the Israelites were

358
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.600
Furnishing the Tabernacle God stirs their

359
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.000
heart to where they just start giving a whole lot and they

360
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.300
just say well I got this i got this let me provide for this and they start bringing so

361
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.200
much that God says to hold up. You got to stop giving your two you're

362
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.600
giving too much.

363
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.400
What a crazy cool thing. That would be right. You guys need

364
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400
to stop giving we have too much.

365
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.600
That's the point here Grace giving.

366
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.400
When you start to give willingly you start to give out of the abundance

367
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.300
of your heart and the grace he's given to you. That's when you know God

368
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.200
is at work.

369
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.700
It's not forced. It's not guilt.

370
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.200
It's just because you love God so much.

371
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.200
there's one more way we see in chapter 8 we know God's grace is

372
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.300
at work in our giving

373
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.300
It's when we give by faith.

374
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.500
Back in 28 when we give by faith.

375
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.400
Paul efforts actually references The Exodus again here in verses

376
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.100
13 through 15.

377
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.800
He says I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened but

378
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.200
that is a matter of fairness your abundance of the present time

379
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.000
should Supply their needs. So they're abundance May Supply your need.

380
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.700
That there may be fairness as it is written. Whoever gathered

381
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.400
much had nothing left over and whoever gathered little

382
00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.800
Had No Lack

383
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.300
So what he's talking about there that last verse he's referencing the

384
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.800
Israelites in the wilderness.

385
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.300
Where if you don't know that story every day?

386
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.300
They don't have the ability to provide themselves food. And so every day they'd

387
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.400
walk out of their tents. And God would have laid this

388
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.700
Dew on the ground.

389
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.900
And it was bread.

390
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.700
And so naturally right they walk out. They're like, what is that? Nobody? I

391
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.500
don't know what that is. So they called it Mana which means I don't know so they

392
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.300
they walk out and God calls them day by

393
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.500
day to walk out collect enough for their family and go

394
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.300
back in and they have provided for them the food they

395
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:39.400
need.

396
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.500
But here's the thing if they tried to store it up.

397
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.000
for the next day

398
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.600
it would spoil.

399
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.100
now

400
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.200
there was one day it didn't that was on the day

401
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.200
before the Sabbath they would collect for two days and it wouldn't spool because God didn't

402
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.300
want them to go work on the Sabbath day. He commanded it that

403
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.100
way and it didn't spoil every other day. It's spoiled.

404
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.800
And so that person had that family had to trust that

405
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.300
they'd wake up that morning walk out of the tent and there'd be

406
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.500
enough out there and they'd go collect it and they'd go eat and

407
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.300
they'd have it and then the next day they'd have to trust again go

408
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.100
out the tent and like God I'm believing. It's out there and you

409
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.000
go outside and you eat and you come in.

410
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.200
But I don't trust you today. So I'm gonna hold I'm gonna hold

411
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.500
it. I'm gonna Store It Up.

412
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.300
He's like that's not what you do.

413
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.900
And it goes bad.

414
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.600
What happened was God was teaching them

415
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.300
how to trust him every day?

416
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.000
how to have faith that he would provide

417
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.800
it's the same for these Corinthian believers.

418
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.400
These Gentile believers who were supposed to

419
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.200
help the Jewish Believers financially, right? They had to

420
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.500
give by faith because they weren't Rich they had to give by faith as

421
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.300
well. And so they're giving like am I going to have enough for tomorrow?

422
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.300
What about next week? I don't know how my income level is

423
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.800
coming. Am I going to have enough?

424
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.500
The principle is what Jesus said in Matthew 6 when we give by faith.

425
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.300
Our Heavenly Father Knows What You

426
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:14.600
Need?

427
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.300
All these things all your daily needs he knows that

428
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.400
but he says seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness

429
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.600
and all these things will be added to you. Your daily

430
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.600
needs will be provided as you seek first and you give you obey he

431
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.900
will provide for you.

432
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.600
See that again later.

433
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.500
So that's chapter 8 that's the idea of how

434
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.700
how we are to give with the right heart

435
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.300
the right Spirit. That's what it looks like. Those are the markers of

436
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.300
it. But what Paul then does in verses 16 through

437
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.600
24.

438
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.300
Is he moves into like a logistics section? It

439
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.500
kind of takes a bit of an aside and he's talking about how this offering

440
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.500
is supposed to be delivered and handled as the Corinthians would

441
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.700
take it in and how it got back to Jerusalem, and he

442
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.200
especially talks about the trustworthiness of those who are

443
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.800
handling the money.

444
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.600
So as I was reading this I was thinking about us as leaders

445
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.600
that we're constantly reexamining and reflecting on what

446
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.700
we've been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of

447
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.300
handling and stewarding God's resources

448
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.900
as a church.

449
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.300
To direct it in the right way and to say God. What do

450
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.500
you want to do with this? And we believe clearly that

451
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.400
God has called us to these certain things to

452
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.300
glorify him by becoming a hub for an all ages disciple making

453
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.500
Movement. We believe that's where God wants to to lead

454
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.000
us and so we we do that we move in directions

455
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.600
as we go that way which we believe leads to

456
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.200
lives transformed.

457
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.500
here in Edmond

458
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.200
Network churches plan like you heard about Brett and all of

459
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.200
that already that's an evidence that God is at work.

460
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.100
We want to have the resources directed towards things like that.

461
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.900
Church has planted like Santa Cruz and Saint Louis and everyday

462
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.300
missionary sent to the ends of the world. Like we've seen in the

463
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.500
last few weeks over and over again people commissioned to go. We want God

464
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.500
to use us towards those ends. And

465
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.400
so we have the responsibility to Steward his resources towards

466
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:06.600
that

467
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.400
and so we focus our efforts on equipping each other to love

468
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.400
Jesus and live sin. That's the daily task. We have as

469
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.600
a church that we're stewarding towards.

470
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.700
We have that responsibility.

471
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.900
and this passage reflects that

472
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.300
we feel the weight of that as Leaders even with the money

473
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.200
that God entrusts to our church. We are

474
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.200
called to be generous and sacrificial as well.

475
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.200
But once he'd explained that what he does

476
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.100
then is in chapter 9 as he picks back up with the

477
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.100
grace giving theme.

478
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.200
And he shows how that giving would play out. What

479
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.400
are its results in the world in those lives when

480
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.100
you give all the ways we've seen what is your giving actually do?

481
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.900
Well first it will prompt others you're giving

482
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.500
will actually prompt others to give

483
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.600
as well. Look at this chapter 9 now.

484
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.800
verses 1 through 5

485
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.200
It is Superfluous to write to the you about the ministry of this

486
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.000
for the Saints for I know you're Readiness of which I boast about you to the

487
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.300
people of Macedonia saying that okay or Corinth has been ready

488
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.200
since last year your Zeal stirred up most of them.

489
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.700
But I'm sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in

490
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.200
this matter. So you may be ready as I said you would be otherwise if

491
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.200
some macedonians come with me find you're not

492
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.300
ready. We'd be humiliated to say nothing of you for being so

493
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:29.800
confident.

494
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.100
So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead

495
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.400
and arrange in advance for the gift you've promised. So maybe ready as

496
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.600
a willing gift not as an exaction.

497
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.500
And so notice what he's doing here remember a year earlier he'd used

498
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.700
the zealous Readiness of the Corinthians to motivate the

499
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.500
macedonians now, he's saying hey

500
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.200
Corinthians listen to the macedonians how watch how

501
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.400
they gave so readily you guys need to do it, too.

502
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.000
He flipped it.

503
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.800
And they're motivating each other and they're prompted by

504
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.600
one generosity so they would be generous as

505
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:03.800
well.

506
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.400
He didn't want them to be embarrassed by saying man. They didn't follow

507
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.100
through on their commitment.

508
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.900
They needed to be not just willing but actually do it.

509
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.100
But here's the thing about that.

510
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.100
when you think about what Jesus said Matthew 6 about

511
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.100
secret giving we should not let her right hand know. What a left hand is doing. How

512
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:27.000
does that square with this that we're trying to motivate people to give without broadcasting

513
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.600
what we give?

514
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.200
Like I don't know how much any of you give like so so what

515
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.500
what do we how do we motivate each other to give without saying

516
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.300
here so much. I've given well remember he's talking to a

517
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:37.700
church here.

518
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.500
He's saying complete the commitment you made and what

519
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.500
would happen is people transformed by the grace of God in their hearts. They're

520
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.700
going to step forward to be willing.

521
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.600
Doesn't mean they're better. Nobody even knows what they're giving. It's just they're

522
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.400
going to do it and motivate others to do it as

523
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.900
they lead out in giving.

524
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.200
That's the idea here of what it is. We don't know what each other

525
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.700
would give necessarily but it's motivating and prompting

526
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.400
others as we show a step of Faith other people

527
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.100
will follow along.

528
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.400
That's what he did with Corinth and Macedonia here.

529
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.100
So it'll prompt others another result.

530
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.300
When you give with the right heart, it will also bless you.

531
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.300
It'll prompt others.

532
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.300
But it will bless you as well.

533
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.700
Now this can't be the primary motivation because that would be just selfish

534
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.300
right? I'm gonna give so I get right and that's

535
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:27.600
not the point.

536
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.300
But it is a nice fringe benefits. We'll see here in verses 6 through

537
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.000
11 of chapter 9.

538
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.900
The point is this whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly.

539
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.100
Whoever sows bountifully will

540
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.200
also reap bountifully.

541
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.900
Each one must give us he has decided in his heart not

542
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.800
reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a

543
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.200
cheerful Giver. The word actually Greek is

544
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.900
hilarious Giver.

545
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.200
And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that having

546
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.500
all sufficiency in all things at all times. You

547
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.000
may abound in every good work comprehensive.

548
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.500
As it is written. He's distributed freely. He's given to the poor his righteousness

549
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.300
endures forever.

550
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.100
He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food

551
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.500
will supply and multiply your seed for sowing increase

552
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.500
the Harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in

553
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.400
every way to be generous in every way which through us will

554
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.100
produce Thanksgiving to God.

555
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.200
Now I did grow up in Northwest, Oklahoma.

556
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.300
But I am about the furthest thing from a farmer you'll ever find in life.

557
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.100
Well, my buddies were out driving tractors in combines. I was sitting

558
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.400
in an air conditioned snow cone hut that I owned that I was eating snow cones

559
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.100
all day. So trade off. I'll take that

560
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.500
one, right?

561
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.300
But I do know.

562
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.500
basic logic about harvesting

563
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.100
This tells us that in harvesting wheat?

564
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.400
The more seed you put in the ground.

565
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.500
The more grain you have the potential of reaping.

566
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.200
Right, it makes sense.

567
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.400
There's more fruit that you could enjoy as God

568
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.200
works.

569
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.300
It makes total sense, right?

570
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.400
The more God will give you as this says more. God

571
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.800
will give you in order to bless other people with it.

572
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.000
And I hope you caught that.

573
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.300
As you're reading this.

574
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.200
I hope you caught that because there are false teachers out there who will

575
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.900
tell you that the more seed you put in means you will

576
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.800
then reap wealth and health rewards

577
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800
on the back side of it.

578
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.700
That you will reap a reward

579
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.200
that will make your life comfortable and all of

580
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.100
those things will come because you give more because you put more seed in the

581
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.200
ground. That's what is often said.

582
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.400
Now, I'm not good. God does give us good things to

583
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.800
enjoy he gives us his provision for

584
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.900
us to enjoy and use absolutely but

585
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.700
all over this passage.

586
00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.400
Did you see it? The more God is giving

587
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.100
you is for more Ministry.

588
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.300
Did you see that right verse 8?

589
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.500
You abound yes in order to abound in

590
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.100
more good works.

591
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.300
It's giving

592
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.000
verse 10. He multiplies seed for more sowing.

593
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.600
Verse 11 you are enriched to be generous. You

594
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.900
see it here.

595
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.500
God blesses us to be a blessing to

596
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:23.900
others.

597
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.400
Not to hoard not to accumulate not to

598
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.600
selfishly seek our own Comfort all the time but to

599
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.200
give more.

600
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.100
Let me just think about as Jesus said it's better to

601
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.500
give than to receive.

602
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:40.800
That's true.

603
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.700
What a blessing it is for you to be able to bless other

604
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.900
people and meet needs and care for them. It's such

605
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.300
a gift to your soul a blessing

606
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.700
to you to give away.

607
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.100
It's so encouraging.

608
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.700
In fact, that's what Paul comes back to and next in verse 12. He

609
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.100
says when you give it will actually meet needs and other

610
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.200
people.

611
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.000
Like verse 12 look at it.

612
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.500
For the ministry of this service, which is a word about

613
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.600
the temple and sacrifices. We'll get to in a second. The ministry

614
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.300
of this service is not only supplying the needs of the Saints,

615
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.800
but it's also overflowing in many Thanksgiving to God.

616
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.800
Right. So he's saying this is a spiritual service like the priests and

617
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.200
the temple brought sacrifices to the Lord. This is

618
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.800
this same thing. We're giving it to the Lord first. This

619
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.600
is a sacrifice a gift to him, but

620
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.900
then it helps other people along the way.

621
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.800
It cares for that's how God cares for his body.

622
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.300
Because God doesn't need your money.

623
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.700
Right God owns everything.

624
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.100
He doesn't need the money. He gives you

625
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.800
the money so you can provide for his body.

626
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.000
That's what Hebrews 13 says don't neglect to do

627
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.200
good and share with others for with such sacrifices. God

628
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.200
is pleased you have

629
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.500
the ability to help people all around you

630
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.500
to be generous with your money time Talent

631
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.500
X all of that resources, and you can just give and

632
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.200
give and give nobody has to know you don't give through the

633
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.000
church you get all kinds of different places as God has blessed you.

634
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.500
But also want to let you know about something that we have at the church.

635
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.900
As you give yourself but there's also a thing called benevolence fund

636
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.400
here at the church.

637
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.700
It's overseen by the deacons people give to it regularly people

638
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.700
give to it one time.

639
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.300
What it is is a fund

640
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.700
designated to help members of our church in

641
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.500
times of need.

642
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.200
That they need some financial hardship some help to overcome

643
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.100
that or they hit a really hard season of life and they just

644
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.000
need a little bit of help along. That's what that's for.

645
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.100
It's a way for us to gather to care for the

646
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.400
body.

647
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.000
You can individually you can't as Community groups of course,

648
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.300
but this is a church-wide thing the more we do together the more we can

649
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.300
see God do so. That's where we have What's called the

650
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.200
benevolence fund?

651
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.300
It's God meeting needs through his

652
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:06.600
body.

653
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.300
But again what that results in the end

654
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.700
of 12 said it you're giving will glorify God.

655
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.000
When you give and people's needs are met when you

656
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.600
give in these ways. God is glorified.

657
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.200
verse 13 continues it

658
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.500
By their approval of this service, they will glorify God

659
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.000
because of your submission to come from the confession the gospel the generosity

660
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.600
of your contribution for them and for all the others.

661
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.100
Like when you give do you hear that when you

662
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.300
give you reflect the gospel?

663
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.300
You give like Jesus gave like we saw Earth. This is what

664
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.400
it does. It shows you've been changed and

665
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.600
it points people to The Giver of all of those good gifts. It

666
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.000
points people to God himself and he gets the glory for it.

667
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.400
See that's that's our hope as as leaders in

668
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.500
the church. Our hope is that people in the world around us see

669
00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.400
us as a church.

670
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.800
They see us not only preaching the gospel, but

671
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.700
also living in light of the Gospel.

672
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.000
That we're not hoarding. We're not about our own Comforts. We're

673
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.400
about tangibly helping people in need all around

674
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.400
us the ways that we can and I know when we

675
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.700
talk talking about like giving money and resources away that that

676
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.600
that's not preaching the gospel. I know that

677
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.500
but often the way we give to people opens

678
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.200
up conversations opens up

679
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.400
their hearts to where they finally listen where they were hard before

680
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.300
where they now know we care for them. So they

681
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.800
might listen to what we're saying now.

682
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.300
We're not all about ourselves. We're about others. It

683
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.200
doesn't have to be in either or we can both preach

684
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.500
the gospel proclaim the gospel and glorify

685
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.300
God in that and give in response to

686
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.500
the Lord's work in US practically obeying the

687
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.300
gospel and glorifying God in that too. We can

688
00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:57.500
do both

689
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.600
so we can give even more as a

690
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.100
church.

691
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:03.600
away

692
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.100
But there's one more tangible benefit.

693
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.200
God's people giving according to God's grace.

694
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.200
It's that it will unite God's people.

695
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.200
When you give like we've seen in chapter

696
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.500
8 it will Unite.

697
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.400
God's people

698
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.200
because remember that was the whole point. Paul was writing this letter.

699
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.300
The whole point of this section is that the Gentiles and

700
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.700
Corinth he wanted them to feel more connected to the Jewish Believers and Israel.

701
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.300
He wanted them to feel more connected to the Gentile Believers over there.

702
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.600
He wanted it all because when they gave out of love what

703
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.500
verse 14 says is that they they will long

704
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.300
for you. They will pray for you because of the

705
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.600
surpassing grace of God upon you.

706
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.800
When they gave the Jewish background Believers Started

707
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.100
Loving them more and that Unity came together.

708
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.000
I remember sitting in an old church building in

709
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.200
Whitley Bay, England.

710
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.500
Which is near Newcastle up on the Northeast Coast.

711
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.300
And there were just a few church members left who live in a very

712
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.100
dark area spiritually.

713
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.600
And I was hearing them say how thankful they

714
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.300
were for our little Church in Fort Worth that

715
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.100
they were praying for us.

716
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.900
Why were they saying that?

717
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.100
Because we had generously invested time.

718
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.700
And resources and ideas and people and money

719
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.000
to advance God's Mission

720
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.400
there in that area.

721
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.300
And listen that was not a church growth strategy for us in Fort

722
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:41.500
Worth.

723
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.200
We would read no benefit of anybody coming to our church

724
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.500
because of that. It was a big sea church growth

725
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.300
mentality. It was a kingdom Advance mentality all the

726
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.200
way on the other side of the world.

727
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.600
And we were saying we're in we want to invest in that Kingdom work

728
00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.800
and that knit our hearts together from thousands

729
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.400
of miles away many people in our church never even met those

730
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.400
people in for in in Whitley Bay, but they

731
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.800
were one body together.

732
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.000
But again, let's go back to the start.

733
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.000
Where does that kind of desire to give come from?

734
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.200
Like where does that kind of desire to invest where does

735
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:21.900
that come from?

736
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.800
Well, look at verse 15 it closes what

737
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.300
he started with right? He says thanks be to

738
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.500
God for his inexpressible gift.

739
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.800
What's the gift?

740
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.000
It's the gospel the grace of

741
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.300
God. Thanks be to God inexpressible the desire to give

742
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.200
comes from the gospel.

743
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.100
See when you and I are so deeply impacted by

744
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.600
God's grace in us when we realize and

745
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.600
recall what he has given to us

746
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.600
in forgiveness through his life death and resurrection that

747
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.100
we were poverty.

748
00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.500
sin poverty now, he's given us righteousness wealth

749
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.700
all of that when we remember where

750
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.600
we've come from like we saying before

751
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.300
That can't help but humble us onto our

752
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.200
knees with the desire to bless others like we've been

753
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:12.500
blessed.

754
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.300
Giving comes from the gospel. It's what second Corinthians

755
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.200
5 says the love of Christ controls us.

756
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.600
that those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for

757
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.400
his sake

758
00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.600
he died for us.

759
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.100
So what else can we do but say I'm gonna live for you.

760
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.600
He died. He was raised. It's changed my life. I'm living

761
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.200
for you. And the gospel is what leads us

762
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.300
to reimagine what generosity looks like in our

763
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:43.500
lives.

764
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.700
That we now can use the money God's

765
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.500
entrusted to us. But also the time the

766
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.200
skill the effort the resources all those things we can use that

767
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.400
for his kingdom purposes. However, he's saying I

768
00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.100
want to do

769
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.400
because remember

770
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.500
You don't own any of that?

771
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:07.300
You don't own your body. You don't own your history. You don't own the money. You have the

772
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.300
the house the family. You don't own any of that. You

773
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.400
didn't manufacture any of that. It's God's grace to

774
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.800
you. So you're a steward not an owner.

775
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.300
And as a steward, it totally changes the way you live

776
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:20.800
your life.

777
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.600
And you can say Okay God.

778
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.900
This is yours. How do you want me to use it?

779
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.200
Because of his grace he's given it to you now you Steward it?

780
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.100
So before we go any further, I want to just examine.

781
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.700
Where we each are in this process in this

782
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:41.800
area?

783
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.900
Ask you a bold question if you're not giving at

784
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.100
all.

785
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.400
Why not?

786
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.100
Why not?

787
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.200
Maybe you've never seen the grace of God like this.

788
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.700
Well, let me just challenge. You take a step baby step

789
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.000
even.

790
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.800
And just start.

791
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.700
Just start giving an investing in God's Kingdom.

792
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.100
In your life day by day through the church as well.

793
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.600
Just start investing in God's kingdom work.

794
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.700
Or maybe you give here and there when you have a little bit extra and you make sure you cover

795
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.500
everything's covered. And then whatever's left over there's usually more month than

796
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.500
Finance at the end of this right nice. Somehow. We

797
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.300
just let that slide start to give consistently.

798
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:37.200
Give first give consistently to the Lord before everything

799
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.500
else and then see what he stretches out the

800
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.700
rest of that money to fit.

801
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.900
Or maybe you have been giving consistently and today maybe

802
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.500
you see.

803
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.300
It's a time for me to invest in bigger ways in

804
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:51.800
God's Kingdom.

805
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.000
Things around the world things through the church and you sound I want to

806
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.600
be investing more.

807
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.500
Seeing all of this for his glory. So that's one

808
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.200
side of it consider where we are financially how we're doing that but

809
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:05.900
here's the other side.

810
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.400
we also

811
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.300
need to think about our daily lives and our attitudes towards

812
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:13.600
money.

813
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.500
Are you greedy?

814
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.600
You wasteful.

815
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.600
Are you focusing on temporary Pleasures rather

816
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.100
than Eternal priorities in any way?

817
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.600
And so what we need to do then with all of that as we consider.

818
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.200
What that teaches the world around us about what we value what that

819
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.400
teaches our own children what we value in life and how we use that we

820
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.900
need to lay that all before the Lord and just say to

821
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.200
him God. I want to submit all of this to

822
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200
your to your will.

823
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.300
You are the king of everything. You're in charge. You're

824
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.800
the owner. This is yours and you just lay it in submission

825
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.200
before him hold it open handed and you

826
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.200
make adjustments to follow him in the

827
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.300
way you need to and then let me let me remind you

828
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.000
that's going to bring blessing in your

829
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.300
life.

830
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.400
Maybe not in the way that somebody will think you would be blessed or

831
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.700
the way you want to be blessed but you will be a part of God's work

832
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.400
that you may never have been before.

833
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.500
And you'll see God do things that you can't take

834
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.500
the credit for that's bigger than you you can invest in

835
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.500
God's kingdom work.

836
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.300
let's lay it there submit to him as the king

837
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.800
as the gracious savior of your life and say

838
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.000
God this is yours do with it what you will

839
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.000
it's worth it Church.

840
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.100
It is worth it.

841
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:40.800
Why?

842
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.700
Because Jesus is worth it.
