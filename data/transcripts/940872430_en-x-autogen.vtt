1
00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:01.215
What have we hear?

2
00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:05.135
What have we hear?

3
00:00:05.465 --> 00:00:08.455
Those were the first words out of the mouth

4
00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:11.015
of Gene Stockwell on

5
00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:16.415
May 3rd, 1964 in a small

6
00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:20.135
building over on Boulevard in front of about 130 people.

7
00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.295
In fact, these are right here. You'll see it on the screen.

8
00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:27.015
These are the notes from which he

9
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:28.415
preached on that first Sunday.

10
00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:34.215
What have we, here was the title of that sermon on that day,

11
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:38.215
the Henderson Hills mission officially began, which later,

12
00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:41.935
uh, a next year became Henderson Hills Baptist Church.

13
00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:44.455
See, in the 1950s

14
00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.775
and sixties, uh, a small group

15
00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.335
of people at First Baptist Church of Edmonds saw the need

16
00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:52.575
for a new church in a growing neighborhood about four miles

17
00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.975
south of their current location.

18
00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.175
And that neighborhood was called Henderson Hills.

19
00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:00.005
And there were many men

20
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.605
and many women in First Baptist Church over the years

21
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:06.325
that sacrificed and gave so that this mission could begin.

22
00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:10.925
In fact, they not only gave, they went, many of them went

23
00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:15.125
to this new church to say, we want to plug in to a place

24
00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.045
that's going to reach a new group of people

25
00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:18.365
that we're not reaching right now.

26
00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:22.805
But that what have we here that Stockwell was asking

27
00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:26.605
that day, that question was, was nothing to do

28
00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:28.845
with the building or with the plot of land

29
00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:31.285
that they were on, that the church had perched.

30
00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:33.565
It was none of that that Henderson had donated.

31
00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:37.965
It was nothing but what God said.

32
00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:40.365
This was, what have we here?

33
00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:45.045
What does God say this place is? What does God say we are?

34
00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:49.285
And what he said in that sermon was that their mission,

35
00:01:49.995 --> 00:01:51.925
what he says, God says about them was

36
00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:53.085
their mission was make disciples.

37
00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:56.365
Their body needed to be unified to do that.

38
00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:00.805
That God's word was their guard and their leader,

39
00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:03.875
and that the Holy Spirit was their power.

40
00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:07.795
Now, that's a sermon I could preach again right now, huh?

41
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:08.995
Like that's something we could just pull

42
00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.035
it out and go again.

43
00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:15.315
But with that as our foundation, I want us to turn

44
00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:17.435
to one Corinthians three today

45
00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:19.835
for just a sh a few short moments.

46
00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:24.435
This passage in one Corinthians three has been our theme

47
00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:27.315
as we've planned and implemented this weekend.

48
00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:32.035
Just what this says, our, our guide as our heartbeat.

49
00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:35.165
Because obviously we want to honor those

50
00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:36.205
to whom honor is due,

51
00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:38.965
those whom God has used, that's biblical.

52
00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.645
But we also need to have the right perspective

53
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.085
that Paul really has about himself

54
00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:52.045
and about others, that even as we honor, even

55
00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:55.525
as we celebrate, as we have our favorites and things,

56
00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:57.445
and we don't divide over those things,

57
00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:58.845
that was the whole theme of this

58
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.030
Chapter. Look at what

59
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.165
he wrote, the Apostle Paul to this church,

60
00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:04.645
one Corinthians three, starting in verse five,

61
00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:06.205
what we can learn from this watch.

62
00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:10.495
He says, what then is Apollos?

63
00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:15.945
What is Paul servants through whom you believed

64
00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:19.425
as the Lord assigned to each?

65
00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:22.785
Let's just pause there for a second what he's saying

66
00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:25.545
to these people who had camped out

67
00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:26.825
on who they were following.

68
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:29.825
He says, it's not about the person preaching

69
00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:31.385
or the person leading or the person

70
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:32.985
discipling or the person, whatever.

71
00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.815
It's not about them. He says, all

72
00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.455
of us are merely servants.

73
00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:41.215
In fact, I went back, Dennis

74
00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:43.295
and watched your retirement sermon and

75
00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:45.055
and what you say in there is that,

76
00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:46.455
that we are mere conduits.

77
00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:49.735
That that's the goal is that you don't remember the pipe

78
00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:51.055
through which the water comes, right?

79
00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:53.975
You remember the water. So that's the goal, is

80
00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:56.615
that we're merely servants what Paul says here now.

81
00:03:56.715 --> 00:03:57.815
Now we've been given a task.

82
00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:00.885
We have been assigned something to do.

83
00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:02.685
That's the first couple words of verse six.

84
00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:06.565
Notice I planted Apollos watered.

85
00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:10.045
So they had been given tasks to do,

86
00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:13.815
and as I'll say next week, were to do that faithfully.

87
00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:18.715
But look at what's next. Continue that verse.

88
00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:23.715
I planted Apollo watered, but God gave the growth.

89
00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:29.745
God gave the growth. It's the whole point of this weekend,

90
00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:32.385
the whole point of our church for 60 years is

91
00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:33.505
that it's God's work.

92
00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.145
It's not us. It's not how we can do it.

93
00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:41.265
It's God's faithfulness to his people. He causes the growth.

94
00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:42.985
It's not about any of us. It's about him.

95
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:47.105
In fact, that's what he says in verse seven here.

96
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.705
So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything

97
00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:54.145
but only God who gives the growth.

98
00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:59.385
It's the only God can take the credit for the last 60 years

99
00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:01.465
of Henderson Hills and,

100
00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:03.065
and whatever he gives us in the future.

101
00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:05.855
Only God can take the credit for that.

102
00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:09.045
We plant, we water, we do these things,

103
00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:11.445
but only God causes the growth.

104
00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:12.965
And then in verse eight, he adds this.

105
00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:17.255
He who plants and he who waters are one,

106
00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:22.135
and each will receive his wages according to his labor.

107
00:05:22.245 --> 00:05:25.255
What that means, he's saying, you fall a Paul Apollos or

108
00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:26.455
or anybody else in the world,

109
00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:30.295
like we're all on the same team, this gospel team,

110
00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:34.375
this Jesus team, we're all working for the same purpose.

111
00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:37.655
We're all together. We're not against one another in this.

112
00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:40.965
Now we have different tasks.

113
00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:44.345
We've been assigned to different parts of the field,

114
00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:48.145
maybe even varying levels of harvest based on which part

115
00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:50.385
of the field or what time of the year we are working.

116
00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:53.065
And the Lord rewards those faithfully,

117
00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.005
but we're all working for the same goal.

118
00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:01.965
We're all one. He says, in fact, verse nine,

119
00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.285
we are God's fellow workers.

120
00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:07.645
Like what a privilege it is.

121
00:06:07.665 --> 00:06:10.085
In Luke 10, he, he says, Jesus says,

122
00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:12.765
the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.

123
00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:14.805
Ask the Lord of the harvest

124
00:06:14.905 --> 00:06:17.045
to send out more laborers into his field.

125
00:06:17.635 --> 00:06:21.085
Here, Paul says, we are God's fellow workers.

126
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:26.805
We are those laborers in his harvest field.

127
00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:30.125
I mean, just think the Lord of the harvest has allowed us,

128
00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:33.205
given us the privilege to work with him

129
00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:37.705
in his power for his harvest.

130
00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:41.965
What a gift. It's his grace to us.

131
00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:44.565
Whether you're on the stage preaching, singing,

132
00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:47.485
leading kids, or whether you are serving behind the scenes

133
00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:51.125
and in merciful ways, caring, that's all harvest work.

134
00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.465
I planted Apollos water, but God costs the growth.

135
00:06:57.835 --> 00:06:59.135
But then notice in verse nine,

136
00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:00.655
he shifts to a different metaphor.

137
00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:03.935
This is verse nine, all the way

138
00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:08.055
and beyond He, he says, you are God's field, God's building.

139
00:07:10.465 --> 00:07:13.405
He shifts to this building idea. In fact, he describes it.

140
00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:14.645
Look at verses 10 through 15,

141
00:07:16.265 --> 00:07:18.485
our role in this building process.

142
00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:22.525
According to the grace of God given to me like a skilled

143
00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:24.525
master builder,

144
00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:28.445
I laid a foundation in someone else's building upon it.

145
00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.165
Let each one take care how he builds upon it.

146
00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:33.445
For no one can lay a foundation other than

147
00:07:33.445 --> 00:07:35.245
that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

148
00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:39.125
Now, if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver,

149
00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:42.205
precious stones, wood, hay, straw,

150
00:07:42.955 --> 00:07:44.885
each one's work will become manifest,

151
00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:46.685
become clear for the day.

152
00:07:46.735 --> 00:07:50.085
We'll disclose it because it will be revealed by fire.

153
00:07:50.305 --> 00:07:52.605
The fire will test what sort of work each one has done.

154
00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:56.035
If the work that anyone has built on the foundation

155
00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:57.715
survives, he'll receive a reward.

156
00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:01.275
If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss.

157
00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:05.155
Though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.

158
00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:09.455
Now, when we look back the last 60 years,

159
00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:11.095
we're not saying Henderson Hills is perfect.

160
00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:17.015
We can all probably recount times where we've built

161
00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:20.965
with wood, hay, straw, right?

162
00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:23.285
The stuff that, yeah, like the three little pigs, the stuff

163
00:08:23.285 --> 00:08:24.605
that gets blown away real fast,

164
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:32.845
but the things that last He says the gold,

165
00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:35.645
silver, precious stones, the things we're building with,

166
00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:38.885
that's what God has used

167
00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:41.285
to make Henderson Hills the way it is today.

168
00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:47.495
Because back 60 years ago this, this church was started

169
00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:48.895
with the proper foundation,

170
00:08:50.025 --> 00:08:52.935
which Paul said was Christ the gospel, the life, death,

171
00:08:52.935 --> 00:08:55.965
and resurrection of Jesus in the place, place of sinners.

172
00:08:55.965 --> 00:08:58.565
That's the foundation. And it always has been.

173
00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:01.205
The foundation and forever will be the foundation.

174
00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:06.645
But then what was built on over the years,

175
00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:10.725
as Paul said here in one Corinthians three over the years

176
00:09:10.795 --> 00:09:15.485
were stones laid on that foundation of sound doctrine,

177
00:09:15.865 --> 00:09:19.125
of generous giving, of faithful serving,

178
00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:21.085
of sacrificial mission.

179
00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:23.845
And you're building this building

180
00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:26.165
of God in a way on the foundation.

181
00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.725
You're building the stones of love for the poor

182
00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:32.805
and the outcast and the orphans and those who are forgotten

183
00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:33.965
and the widows and,

184
00:09:34.065 --> 00:09:37.005
and you're building the stone of holding fast to the Lord

185
00:09:37.155 --> 00:09:40.885
through deep tragedy and loss over the 60 years.

186
00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:43.165
See, that's the kind of stuff that lasts.

187
00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:47.555
That's the kind of stuff that God builds his church with

188
00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:49.395
because it's what he says matters.

189
00:09:50.935 --> 00:09:54.995
Not all the other stuff, not the the silly wood, hay, straw.

190
00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:57.235
He's like, no, these are the things my word says.

191
00:09:57.235 --> 00:09:58.755
These are the things that matter,

192
00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:02.195
and you build with stones of those things.

193
00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.275
That's what he blesses.

194
00:10:06.895 --> 00:10:08.995
And so here's the question in front of us today, church,

195
00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.145
as we build on this gospel foundation,

196
00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:21.555
how will we build, we've heard what he's done.

197
00:10:22.885 --> 00:10:24.305
How will we now build?

198
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:27.345
What stones will we put on that foundation?

199
00:10:27.345 --> 00:10:28.665
Because look at verses 16

200
00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:33.385
and 17, do you not know that you, that's plural.

201
00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:35.865
He's talking to the whole, not just you as an individual.

202
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:38.145
You together are God's temple

203
00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:40.825
and that God's spirit dwells in you.

204
00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:46.235
If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him.

205
00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:50.555
For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.

206
00:10:52.995 --> 00:10:56.215
We, the church is the temple of God.

207
00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:59.335
The spirit of God dwells within us.

208
00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:04.265
And so we as the temple are building upon the stones

209
00:11:04.285 --> 00:11:05.745
of those who've gone before us.

210
00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:07.345
The stones have been built,

211
00:11:07.485 --> 00:11:09.305
and now we're building on top of those.

212
00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:10.305
We're adding to it,

213
00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:13.425
and those 60 years from now are gonna be adding on top

214
00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:14.705
of those stones as we go.

215
00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:19.855
And so will we be faithful with our part.

216
00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:23.685
Take care how you're building.

217
00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:25.565
He says, how are we gonna be faithful?

218
00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:27.045
They've been faithful for us.

219
00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:29.725
Will we be faithful for those coming behind us?

220
00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:36.425
Will we exemplify this counterculture community

221
00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:39.745
so transformed by the gospel that we're different,

222
00:11:42.345 --> 00:11:46.935
different in the way that we serve wholeheartedly different,

223
00:11:46.935 --> 00:11:49.135
in the way that we prioritize God's word

224
00:11:49.135 --> 00:11:53.455
above every other voice different in in the way

225
00:11:53.455 --> 00:11:54.535
that we sacrifice

226
00:11:54.635 --> 00:11:57.695
to plant other churches like First Baptist Church planted us

227
00:11:57.705 --> 00:12:02.485
60 years ago, different in

228
00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:05.525
how we are anchored by these cherished doctrines

229
00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:10.325
of the church for thousands of years, yet also willing

230
00:12:10.325 --> 00:12:12.965
to adapt our methods to reach the next generations

231
00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:18.855
different in how we love our neighbors so much

232
00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:23.445
that they are compelled to love God through us.

233
00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:29.255
Yet we can't forget this church.

234
00:12:30.995 --> 00:12:32.095
We can't do any of that

235
00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:36.055
unless God gives the growth.

236
00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:40.715
That's why he should get the glory for this.

237
00:12:41.455 --> 00:12:42.835
That's why this is about him.

238
00:12:42.975 --> 00:12:45.155
Not any person, not any group, not any era,

239
00:12:45.335 --> 00:12:47.115
not any program, none of that.

240
00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:50.395
Psalm 1 45, unless the Lord builds the house,

241
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.915
the laborers build in vain.

242
00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:57.345
May that be our prayer

243
00:12:58.085 --> 00:13:02.945
and our theme, our posture for the next 60 years as well.
