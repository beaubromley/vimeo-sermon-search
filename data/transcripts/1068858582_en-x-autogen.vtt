WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.255
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.695
It's great to be together as it always is.

3
00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:22.855
Great to be together.

4
00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:25.255
If you're new here, my name's John, one of the pastors here.

5
00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:27.415
I get the privilege of preaching most of the time,

6
00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:31.215
but I'm thankful, like last week for Dan filling in to, uh,

7
00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:34.175
continue anchoring us in the truth of God's word.

8
00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:35.695
That's what we do around here,

9
00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:37.255
and we're thankful for that, uh,

10
00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:39.615
including this book called First Samuel

11
00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:40.735
that we're studying through.

12
00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:42.975
And so invite you to take your copy of God's word

13
00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.215
and turn there as we're journeying

14
00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.335
through in really nearing the end of it.

15
00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.535
Now, first Samuel in the Old Testament,

16
00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:52.255
chapter 27 is where we're gonna start today.

17
00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:55.255
Uh, just to catch us up again, reminding us

18
00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:56.935
of what's been happening the last few weeks.

19
00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:58.655
Over the last few weeks, we've seen David

20
00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.735
continue growing in his trust of the Lord.

21
00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:05.415
That's the all caps Lord Yahweh,

22
00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:06.735
that Dan talked about last week.

23
00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:10.815
Uh, this is the God almighty kind of Lord who's near,

24
00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:12.615
uh, David's grown in that.

25
00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:14.495
Now, here's the question. Has he figured it out?

26
00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:17.425
Has David finally figured it out?

27
00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.505
It seems like he's passed the test that God has put in front

28
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.185
of him, but is he finished

29
00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:27.015
or is there more growth that David needs in his life?

30
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:32.445
Well, in many ways, the parable of the prodigal son

31
00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:36.565
that Jesus gave in Luke 15 is a close parallel

32
00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:38.965
to the passage we're gonna study today about David.

33
00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:43.405
They will walk in many ways the same path,

34
00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:45.285
and we'll see that today.

35
00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:48.685
And, and we can almost call this the prodigal David story in

36
00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.125
a way as we go.

37
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:51.925
But what it's gonna do is it's gonna show us about David,

38
00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.405
of course, but it, it's, it's also gonna challenge us

39
00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:58.765
as we consider the similarities that we'll see in his life

40
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.485
to our life, what that means

41
00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:04.645
as we take our steps forward today.

42
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.565
So I wanna pray briefly to start. God, this is your word.

43
00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:10.405
We trust you with it, and we trust you'll speak

44
00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:11.925
by your Holy Spirit through it.

45
00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:17.475
I can't. You need to, and so open our hearts to see

46
00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.395
and understand and apply, not just be hearers of the word

47
00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:23.555
but doers of it because you have loved us.

48
00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:28.685
So thank you, God, help us Holy Spirit, in Jesus' name.

49
00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:32.845
Amen. Now, I had to make a choice

50
00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:34.285
as I was preparing this sermon.

51
00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:36.765
Uh, as you can see, if you've got your notes maybe on the

52
00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.645
app, you can see that we're going to actually skip most all

53
00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:42.045
of chapter 28 today.

54
00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:43.605
And, and we're gonna do that next Sunday.

55
00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:45.445
And the reason I did that is

56
00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:47.805
because the chapters we're studying today is, is the story

57
00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:49.765
of David leading up to

58
00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:53.125
and what he was doing during the battle

59
00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:54.765
that we'll see at the end of one Samuel.

60
00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:58.245
This is the David story to get us there, chapter 28.

61
00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:01.925
Most of it is Saul's story of how, how he got there.

62
00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:04.325
And so felt like, you know, it, it's,

63
00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:06.485
it's just like the book has already done over and over.

64
00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:09.125
It's, it's creating tension between Saul and David.

65
00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:11.205
It's, it's a contrast between the two

66
00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:12.645
and how they handled the relationship

67
00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:14.005
with God and relationship with people.

68
00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:17.765
And so this does the narrator inserts 28 in the middle

69
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.525
of David's story to create tension.

70
00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:21.245
But I felt like we just needed

71
00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:22.645
to finish David's story today.

72
00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:26.045
It's gonna help us understand really the fullness of it.

73
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:29.445
Uh, and then next week we'll get to Saul in chapter 28

74
00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.205
and then finish it before we get to Palm Sunday and Easter.

75
00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:35.125
Uh, but I just felt we needed to finish today.

76
00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:39.325
And so we're gonna look at 27 and then 29 and 30 today.

77
00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:41.925
A lot to cover. But uh, just again, think about

78
00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:44.165
what we've seen of David to this point.

79
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.525
And we're gonna put this chart up.

80
00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.885
We've put up all of the series so far

81
00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:50.565
and just shows the track of David growing in his trust

82
00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:52.925
of God gaining victory over his enemies,

83
00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:54.925
clearly heading toward the throne.

84
00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:56.565
But Saul, on the other hand,

85
00:03:56.825 --> 00:03:58.645
is heading the exact opposite direction.

86
00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:02.285
And we'll see that end in chapter 31 in a couple weeks.

87
00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:06.845
Today though, today we

88
00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:09.645
take an off ramp and,

89
00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:14.085
and things tend to go awry for David almost outta nowhere.

90
00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:20.365
Like as we take this off ramp, it again parallels

91
00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:22.365
to Luke 15, the parable of the prodigal son.

92
00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:25.525
What we'll see David do today is he runs into the wilderness

93
00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:28.765
and he ran into the wilderness here

94
00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:30.965
in this scene in his life.

95
00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:37.375
And if you saw last week, chapter 26, David trusted God

96
00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:40.815
so well after that chapter 27,

97
00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:43.175
verse one is almost jarring

98
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.115
how quickly this change happens.

99
00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:51.115
Look at verse one, then David said in his heart,

100
00:04:52.065 --> 00:04:54.805
now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul.

101
00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:58.365
There's nothing better for me than that.

102
00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:00.445
I should escape to the land of the Philistines.

103
00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:02.125
Then Saul will despair

104
00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.365
of seeking many longer within the borders of Israel.

105
00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:06.645
I shall escape out of his hand.

106
00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:13.075
Like, what David, do you not remember

107
00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:16.315
what God has done over and over delivered you from this?

108
00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:18.595
And from that, you changed God's changed your heart

109
00:05:18.855 --> 00:05:21.915
to be trusting Saul with God like,

110
00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:23.515
God, you're gonna take care of this.

111
00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:24.755
I know it. I've seen it.

112
00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:28.235
I could have taken his life in chapter 26, but I didn't.

113
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:33.485
God, you got this. And now this, all

114
00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:35.365
of a sudden he's like, I'm scared of Saul.

115
00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:37.955
I got a leaf. Where did that come from?

116
00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:42.915
Whatever it was that caused David to look again at his

117
00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:45.835
situation, to see what appeared

118
00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:47.515
to be the writing on the wall.

119
00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.355
He threw up his hands and ran. He ran, he caved to fear.

120
00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:56.675
Here. He seemed to cave to a fear

121
00:05:57.035 --> 00:05:59.925
that whatever it was caused him to worry

122
00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:02.845
that Saul was gonna find him, was gonna eliminate him,

123
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:05.085
was gonna keep him from the throne that God had promised.

124
00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:07.445
He caved to that fear

125
00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:10.215
and notice where he went,

126
00:06:11.385 --> 00:06:12.955
like he headed back across the border

127
00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:14.355
to those beloved people,

128
00:06:14.535 --> 00:06:17.115
the Philistines, you remember them, right?

129
00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:20.795
The the ones who presented Goliath as their champion

130
00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:22.075
and David defeated him.

131
00:06:22.095 --> 00:06:24.635
And they're the same ones that David ran away

132
00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:26.275
to earlier in the book

133
00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:28.915
and deceived Aish there and, and all that.

134
00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:31.035
That's the same kind of guys, same people,

135
00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:36.795
but David ran away to them.

136
00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:42.365
Now, it seemed to kinda work, actually, look at verse four.

137
00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:48.715
And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath

138
00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:51.555
that's in Philistine country, he no longer sought him.

139
00:06:53.425 --> 00:06:55.805
So it seemed to work. David was like,

140
00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:58.615
I gotta get outta here, so I'm gonna run away to Phil,

141
00:06:58.675 --> 00:07:02.175
to Phil Philistia, and, and God is gonna protect me there.

142
00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:04.055
I I'm not protected here from

143
00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:05.295
Saul, but I'm gonna be protected over there.

144
00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:08.015
It seemed to work. Saul stopped chasing him.

145
00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:09.495
It created a whole new set

146
00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:10.935
of problems that we'll get to in a second.

147
00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:13.375
But it seemed to work. In fact,

148
00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:15.095
David got some nice digs outta the deal.

149
00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:17.295
Watch this, verse five. Then David said to Aish,

150
00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:19.055
if I have found favor in your eyes,

151
00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:21.615
let a place be given me in one of the country towns

152
00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:23.855
that I may dwell there, why should your servant

153
00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:25.175
dwell in the royal city with you?

154
00:07:25.435 --> 00:07:28.415
So that day, Aish gave him, Ziklag gave him the whole town,

155
00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:31.335
and therefore Ziklag belonged to the kings of Judah.

156
00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:33.095
To this day, the number of days

157
00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:35.055
that David lived in the country, the Philistines was a

158
00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.335
year and four months.

159
00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:40.445
And so it seemed to work.

160
00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:45.635
He even seemed to have some things going his way.

161
00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:50.755
Yet here's the problem. In his fear,

162
00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:55.835
David was not fully truthful with the Philistines,

163
00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.395
just like he'd done earlier.

164
00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:01.805
He ran away to Aish, he acted insane.

165
00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:05.005
They kicked him back out. He was not fully truthful here.

166
00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:08.085
He actually returned to that deception from

167
00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:10.445
before David.

168
00:08:10.575 --> 00:08:13.925
David returned to the deception that he'd done before.

169
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.965
He's doing it again right here

170
00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:18.445
and watch this verses eight through 12.

171
00:08:19.725 --> 00:08:21.985
You'll see it very clearly here as he goes

172
00:08:22.575 --> 00:08:25.545
into this interaction with the Philistines.

173
00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:27.545
Now, David and his men went up

174
00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:29.785
and made raids against the Gsites,

175
00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:31.465
the Gsites, and the Amalekites.

176
00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:33.945
For these were the inhabitants of the land from of old

177
00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:35.385
as far as sure to the land of Egypt.

178
00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:37.825
That's all the enemies of God, basically.

179
00:08:39.045 --> 00:08:42.265
And David would strike the land and would leave neither man

180
00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:45.345
nor woman alive, but would take away the sheep, the ox,

181
00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:46.985
and the donkeys, the camels, the garments,

182
00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.585
and come back to Aish.

183
00:08:49.285 --> 00:08:52.305
And when Aish asked, where have you made a raid today,

184
00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:56.205
David would say, against the, the neb of Judah

185
00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:58.935
or against the neb of the lyes

186
00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:01.335
or against the negative of the cites.

187
00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.005
And David would leave neither man

188
00:09:04.005 --> 00:09:05.485
nor woman alive to bring news

189
00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:08.205
to Gath thinking lest they should tell about us

190
00:09:08.305 --> 00:09:11.605
and say, so David has done that tattle on him.

191
00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:15.295
Such was his custom. All the while he lived in the country,

192
00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:18.925
the Philistines and Aish trusted David

193
00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:22.895
thinking he has made himself an utter stench

194
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.215
to his people Israel.

195
00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:26.775
Therefore he shall always be my servant.

196
00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:29.965
So lemme explain what's going on here.

197
00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:33.695
David lived far enough away from Aish

198
00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:35.695
that Aish couldn't check on him all the time.

199
00:09:36.945 --> 00:09:41.575
And what he would do is he would lie to Aish about

200
00:09:41.575 --> 00:09:42.575
what he was actually doing

201
00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:46.975
because he was telling Aish that he was going

202
00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:48.655
to attack his own people.

203
00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:50.575
He was gonna, he was going into Israel to fight.

204
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.615
He was going to take his own people's stuff.

205
00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:54.775
But what was he actually doing?

206
00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:57.805
He was weakening the Philistine forces.

207
00:09:58.385 --> 00:09:59.805
He was fighting against those

208
00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:01.925
who were aligning with the Philistines.

209
00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:05.525
He was systematically breaking down their defenses.

210
00:10:07.955 --> 00:10:09.335
Now you might look at that and say, well,

211
00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:12.215
David's just being a, a wise military leader.

212
00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:14.855
He got in behind the, the enemy lines

213
00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:16.735
and he's, he's working from the inside out.

214
00:10:16.735 --> 00:10:18.615
He's, he's a great military leader.

215
00:10:18.675 --> 00:10:20.015
Now that might be partially true,

216
00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:22.655
but we can't discount what verse one said.

217
00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:27.565
Remember, David went to the Philistine country

218
00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:30.565
as a result of his fear.

219
00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:33.685
It wasn't because he was going

220
00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:35.845
with this shrewd military strategy.

221
00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:40.995
He was going because he was afraid it wasn't done out

222
00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:42.035
of trust in the Lord.

223
00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:44.675
In fact, God is not even mentioned in

224
00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:45.755
this whole part right here.

225
00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:48.235
He wasn't asking God anything.

226
00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:49.435
He was just going out of fear.

227
00:10:49.535 --> 00:10:53.275
And so he went, and

228
00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:55.715
what it did is it created a tension here,

229
00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:01.725
attention that David suffered in that he had to deal with.

230
00:11:01.825 --> 00:11:04.285
Now he was, he was in the middle of a mess.

231
00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:09.705
And look down at chapter 28.

232
00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:10.905
Now the first two verses,

233
00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:15.905
we'll see it in those days.

234
00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:18.555
The Philistines gathered their forces for war

235
00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:20.635
to fight against Israel.

236
00:11:21.025 --> 00:11:22.035
This is again, leading to

237
00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:23.715
that last battle we'll get to in a couple weeks.

238
00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:26.195
In chapter 31, they're starting the

239
00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:27.315
preparation for the battle.

240
00:11:27.615 --> 00:11:30.395
And Aish said to David, understand that you

241
00:11:30.415 --> 00:11:33.475
and your men are to go out with me in the army.

242
00:11:36.605 --> 00:11:37.785
You're gonna fight with us.

243
00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:41.185
David said to Aish, very well,

244
00:11:41.185 --> 00:11:42.425
you shall know what your servant can do.

245
00:11:42.645 --> 00:11:44.385
And Aish said to David, very well,

246
00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:47.345
I'll make you my bodyguard for life.

247
00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:54.165
This is the tension. Aish assumed David was on his side.

248
00:11:55.305 --> 00:11:57.765
He, he just knew that that's all he knew was

249
00:11:57.765 --> 00:12:00.165
that David had been fighting his battles already.

250
00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:02.805
So why wouldn't he fight in this battle with him?

251
00:12:04.075 --> 00:12:06.965
This is the tension that David had been telling him the

252
00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:08.525
whole time I've been fighting on your side

253
00:12:10.055 --> 00:12:12.075
and now he's gonna be forced

254
00:12:12.575 --> 00:12:14.795
to fight against his own people.

255
00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.285
Like that's the tension we're in here.

256
00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:20.285
That's the pickle David has created for himself is

257
00:12:20.285 --> 00:12:23.005
that he'd been lying the whole time and now he's stuck.

258
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.985
He has to or tell the truth

259
00:12:26.005 --> 00:12:27.105
and he could get killed for that.

260
00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:32.615
He created this tension. He'd, he'd run into the wilderness.

261
00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:37.535
He had run away from all the trust he supposedly had in God

262
00:12:39.505 --> 00:12:41.765
and now he's created this mess of a situation.

263
00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:48.425
And so like I said before, this is when the insertion

264
00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:50.145
of Saul's story happens.

265
00:12:50.365 --> 00:12:53.865
The narrator puts in the rest of chapter 28 as Saul

266
00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:56.345
and his preparation for that battle.

267
00:12:56.535 --> 00:12:59.985
What Saul doing at the same time, David's doing this, all of

268
00:12:59.985 --> 00:13:01.665
that's leading us to chapter 31.

269
00:13:01.665 --> 00:13:02.945
We'll come back to that next Sunday.

270
00:13:03.015 --> 00:13:05.105
It's very revealing about Saul.

271
00:13:06.555 --> 00:13:09.335
But again, we need to, we need to finish David's story here.

272
00:13:10.275 --> 00:13:13.015
It creates tension about how they're both handling this.

273
00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:18.175
We'll see it next week, but to finish David's story, we need

274
00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:19.295
to see how this resolves.

275
00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:22.695
So we need to skip ahead to chapter 29.

276
00:13:24.525 --> 00:13:28.635
Watch David's story resolve here that,

277
00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:30.195
that he had run into the wilderness.

278
00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:34.345
Yes, that's part of it. He's running away from trust in God.

279
00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:35.785
He's trying his own understanding.

280
00:13:36.085 --> 00:13:38.265
Here's where we're at in the story,

281
00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:41.615
but I've already mentioned Luke 15,

282
00:13:42.395 --> 00:13:43.855
the parable of the prodigal son.

283
00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:46.775
What we're gonna watch now is David

284
00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:49.015
actually run back to his father.

285
00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:53.645
David actually runs back to his father.

286
00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:56.005
In the middle of the tension that he's in,

287
00:13:57.895 --> 00:13:59.835
he runs back to his father.

288
00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:02.945
And here's what's interesting about it.

289
00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:06.385
The first move of this is actually by God himself.

290
00:14:07.255 --> 00:14:09.025
It's not David waking up all

291
00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:10.425
of a sudden realizing, well, I'm in trouble.

292
00:14:10.885 --> 00:14:14.505
God, I need you. It was God who moved first, which he's done

293
00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:16.465
that throughout the book, right?

294
00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:18.665
He does that throughout history, is

295
00:14:18.665 --> 00:14:21.505
that God providentially does works

296
00:14:22.005 --> 00:14:24.705
to bring about His purposes in our lives.

297
00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:26.465
It's God's initiative.

298
00:14:26.775 --> 00:14:30.065
He's the one who works first and watch what he does here.

299
00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:36.215
He providentially removed David from this tense situation

300
00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:42.005
like David's in a no way out situation, no way out of this.

301
00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:47.305
And God said, I got you. He removed David from it.

302
00:14:47.305 --> 00:14:48.785
Here's how it went. Look at chapter

303
00:14:48.785 --> 00:14:50.225
29 verses one through five.

304
00:14:53.195 --> 00:14:54.695
Now, the Philistines had gathered all

305
00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:55.735
their forces at a effect.

306
00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:57.815
The Israelites were encamped by the spring.

307
00:14:57.815 --> 00:15:01.255
That is in Jezreel, like the armies are amassing for battle.

308
00:15:01.605 --> 00:15:03.575
It's coming here in a couple chapters.

309
00:15:04.275 --> 00:15:05.895
Now, verse two, as the Lords

310
00:15:05.895 --> 00:15:07.775
of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds

311
00:15:07.775 --> 00:15:09.535
and by thousands marching kind

312
00:15:09.535 --> 00:15:10.895
of preparation for the battle.

313
00:15:11.275 --> 00:15:14.575
And David and his men were passing on in the rear with Aish,

314
00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:17.175
the commanders of the Philistines said,

315
00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:18.815
what are these Hebrews doing here?

316
00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:21.715
Those are our enemies. Those are about,

317
00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:22.795
we're we're about to fight them.

318
00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:25.195
What are the Hebrews doing here?

319
00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.445
And Aish said to the commanders of the Philistines,

320
00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:31.925
is this not David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel,

321
00:15:32.145 --> 00:15:34.205
who has been with me now for days and years

322
00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:38.325
and since he deserted to me, I have found no fault in him

323
00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:43.245
to this day, but the

324
00:15:43.245 --> 00:15:44.925
commanders of the Philistines were angry with him.

325
00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.885
And the commanders of the Philistines said to him,

326
00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.605
send the man back that he may return

327
00:15:49.605 --> 00:15:50.885
to the place to which you've assigned him.

328
00:15:51.105 --> 00:15:54.445
He shall not go down to the battle with us,

329
00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:57.685
lest in the battle he become an adversary to us.

330
00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:00.565
For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his Lord?

331
00:16:00.615 --> 00:16:02.405
Would it not be with the heads of the men here?

332
00:16:02.405 --> 00:16:03.805
Meaning we, we know this guy.

333
00:16:04.555 --> 00:16:07.805
He's probably plotting a military strategy here.

334
00:16:08.015 --> 00:16:11.755
Don't let him. Verse five is this, not David

335
00:16:12.095 --> 00:16:14.115
of whom they sing to one another in dances.

336
00:16:14.785 --> 00:16:16.435
Saul struck down his thousands, David,

337
00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:18.555
his 10 thousands, right?

338
00:16:19.105 --> 00:16:20.635
Aish trusted David,

339
00:16:21.175 --> 00:16:23.875
but the military commanders didn't 'cause they knew David.

340
00:16:24.105 --> 00:16:25.915
They were on the battlefield with David.

341
00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:27.955
They saw him strike down Goliath

342
00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:29.195
and all these thousands of people.

343
00:16:29.425 --> 00:16:30.755
They knew David, and they were like,

344
00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:35.375
I don't trust him, but Aish did.

345
00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:37.735
Why? Because David had been lying to him the whole time.

346
00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:44.165
Look at how the tension builds.

347
00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:49.185
Continuing in that vein, verse six, then Aish called David

348
00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:51.665
and said to him, as the Lord, Yahweh lives,

349
00:16:51.765 --> 00:16:56.285
you have been honest to me.

350
00:16:56.285 --> 00:16:57.885
It seems right that you should march out

351
00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:59.365
and end with me in the campaign

352
00:16:59.465 --> 00:17:02.325
for I have found nothing wrong in you from the day

353
00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:03.805
of your coming to me to this day.

354
00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:07.815
Nevertheless, the Lords do not approve of you.

355
00:17:08.115 --> 00:17:09.935
So go back, go peaceably

356
00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:12.375
that you may not displease the Lords of the Philistines.

357
00:17:12.515 --> 00:17:15.655
Now, watch this. David said to Aish, but what have I done?

358
00:17:16.085 --> 00:17:18.335
What have you found in your servant from the day I entered

359
00:17:18.335 --> 00:17:20.055
your service until now that I may not go

360
00:17:20.055 --> 00:17:22.015
and fight against the enemies of my Lord the king.

361
00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:26.185
David's just continuing to play it out in verse nine.

362
00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:27.265
And Aish answered David

363
00:17:27.325 --> 00:17:30.665
and said, I know that you are as blameless in my sight

364
00:17:30.685 --> 00:17:31.865
as an angel of God.

365
00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:35.845
Wow. Nevertheless, the commanders

366
00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:36.885
of the Philistines have said,

367
00:17:36.945 --> 00:17:38.405
he shall not go up with us to the battle.

368
00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:44.515
Now again, the only reason Akos trusted David is

369
00:17:44.635 --> 00:17:46.355
'cause David had been lying to him the whole time.

370
00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:55.435
Yet, look at how God worked in spite of

371
00:17:55.435 --> 00:17:56.715
that Verse 10,

372
00:17:58.835 --> 00:18:00.765
Aish continued now then rise early in the morning

373
00:18:00.765 --> 00:18:02.325
with the servants of your Lord who came with you.

374
00:18:02.455 --> 00:18:03.365
Start early in the morning,

375
00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:04.565
depart as soon as you have light.

376
00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:07.485
And David set out with his men early in the morning

377
00:18:07.825 --> 00:18:10.685
to return to the land of the Philistines to go home.

378
00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:14.005
But the Philistines went up to Jezreel, to the battle.

379
00:18:16.305 --> 00:18:20.155
Like, is that not great grace of God?

380
00:18:22.425 --> 00:18:24.255
David ran away from trust.

381
00:18:24.345 --> 00:18:27.375
David lied David try to manipulate.

382
00:18:27.515 --> 00:18:30.055
And God said, I'm still going to remove you from

383
00:18:30.055 --> 00:18:32.435
that situation so you don't have

384
00:18:32.435 --> 00:18:33.835
to pay the consequence of it.

385
00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:37.905
I mean, I dunno about you, but I, I can look back at my life

386
00:18:38.645 --> 00:18:40.465
so many times that I've blown it.

387
00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:43.705
I've run into some really tragic tense,

388
00:18:44.325 --> 00:18:45.545
no way out situation.

389
00:18:45.845 --> 00:18:48.465
And somehow God graciously removed me from it.

390
00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:50.465
Not because I'm awesome or

391
00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:52.145
because I was great to figure it out.

392
00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:56.215
It's because he just graciously did it. And I was spared.

393
00:18:57.885 --> 00:18:59.385
God did that for David here.

394
00:19:01.205 --> 00:19:03.065
He looked like he might have to fight his own people.

395
00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:05.065
He was in this mess. He deceived,

396
00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:08.105
but God removed him from it completely.

397
00:19:08.325 --> 00:19:10.825
God resolved the situation himself.

398
00:19:11.205 --> 00:19:15.225
God opened the door for David to return to him.

399
00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:16.705
Isn't God good like that?

400
00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:23.455
But but before you get the wrong idea about this,

401
00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:26.895
it wasn't then smooth sailing

402
00:19:27.245 --> 00:19:28.495
from that point forward for David.

403
00:19:29.645 --> 00:19:31.175
Like, oh, he got delivered. This is great.

404
00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:32.855
He's gonna be all right. Everything's fine.

405
00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:34.535
No, because while David

406
00:19:34.595 --> 00:19:38.215
and his men were away preparing for this potential battle,

407
00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:42.115
they have to be with Aish, they gotta march in the parade.

408
00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:43.635
All these things, they're away from home.

409
00:19:44.005 --> 00:19:47.675
While that happened, something terrible had occurred

410
00:19:49.965 --> 00:19:51.435
continuing to chapter 30.

411
00:19:55.345 --> 00:19:56.645
Now, when David and his men came

412
00:19:56.645 --> 00:19:58.885
to Ziklag their hometown on the third day,

413
00:19:59.225 --> 00:20:01.965
the Amalekites had made a raid against the nega,

414
00:20:01.965 --> 00:20:03.085
against Ziklag.

415
00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:05.325
They had overcome ziklag

416
00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:07.965
and burned it with fire, had taken captive the women

417
00:20:08.065 --> 00:20:09.925
and all who were in it, both small and great.

418
00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:13.365
They killed no one, but carried them off and went their way.

419
00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:16.105
And when David and his men came to the city,

420
00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:18.865
they found it burned with fire and their wives and sons

421
00:20:18.865 --> 00:20:20.665
and daughters taken captive.

422
00:20:22.435 --> 00:20:23.645
Then David and the people who were

423
00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:24.725
with him raised their voices

424
00:20:24.865 --> 00:20:27.205
and wept until they had no more strength to weep.

425
00:20:28.515 --> 00:20:31.365
David's two wives had also been taken captive, a em

426
00:20:31.365 --> 00:20:34.045
of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nal of Carmel.

427
00:20:34.665 --> 00:20:37.525
And David was greatly distressed for the people spoke

428
00:20:37.525 --> 00:20:41.725
of stoning him because all the people were bitter in soul

429
00:20:41.875 --> 00:20:44.045
each for his sons and daughters.

430
00:20:47.865 --> 00:20:49.355
What a terrible thing to come home to.

431
00:20:49.355 --> 00:20:53.655
Right house burned down

432
00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:56.775
wives, children, everybody's gone.

433
00:20:56.775 --> 00:20:58.015
You don't know if they're dead or alive.

434
00:20:58.015 --> 00:20:59.215
And it's just this tragedy.

435
00:21:00.395 --> 00:21:02.155
I mean, you can think and imagine David

436
00:21:02.175 --> 00:21:04.475
and his men would've been greatly distressed.

437
00:21:04.475 --> 00:21:07.475
They would've been angry. Even the people were blaming

438
00:21:08.085 --> 00:21:10.355
David, the one who got him into this mess.

439
00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:12.115
Like, if we wouldn't have had to leave with Aish

440
00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:14.675
and you weren't lying to him, then we would've not had

441
00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:18.605
to leave our families here if we wouldn't have had

442
00:21:18.605 --> 00:21:20.045
to leave Israel if you weren't afraid.

443
00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:24.925
Like they're blaming David for every step of this. Terrible.

444
00:21:28.465 --> 00:21:33.325
Now, I, I need to make a little bit of a sidebar here

445
00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.925
for a second because I skipped something a couple weeks ago.

446
00:21:35.945 --> 00:21:38.995
You might have picked it up. It, it's really something that

447
00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:41.635
needs to be addressed because people will bring it up

448
00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:42.915
as a question about the Bible

449
00:21:42.975 --> 00:21:44.435
or a question about Christianity

450
00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:45.795
and how it all works together.

451
00:21:46.225 --> 00:21:47.755
It's the issue that we just saw

452
00:21:48.105 --> 00:21:50.075
that David had multiple wives,

453
00:21:51.335 --> 00:21:54.105
because that doesn't square with like what we all say.

454
00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:55.985
Everything here is like, well, how, wait, wait a second.

455
00:21:56.665 --> 00:21:59.295
David had, I thought he was a man after God's own heart.

456
00:21:59.355 --> 00:22:02.885
He has multiple wives here. And it's not just David.

457
00:22:02.885 --> 00:22:05.405
There are many instances of polygamy in the Old Testament.

458
00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:06.845
So what do we do with that?

459
00:22:08.185 --> 00:22:10.485
We can't just skate over it and say, ah, it's not important.

460
00:22:10.625 --> 00:22:12.205
It, it's a big deal. What do we do with that?

461
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.085
Now, I'm gonna try to answer in a simple way.

462
00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.125
It's not the full answer. You can do more research,

463
00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:18.245
talk more about it later.

464
00:22:19.185 --> 00:22:21.965
But here, here's, here's a brief way to understand this.

465
00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:26.775
Remember first, that allowance is not the same as approval.

466
00:22:28.735 --> 00:22:30.265
Just 'cause I've got allowed something

467
00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:31.425
doesn't mean he approves of it.

468
00:22:32.405 --> 00:22:33.625
And did he even allow it that?

469
00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:35.465
We'll see that a little bit later, but,

470
00:22:35.685 --> 00:22:37.825
but here's, here's some of the reasons maybe

471
00:22:38.375 --> 00:22:41.225
that God allowed this is that many women couldn't provide

472
00:22:41.225 --> 00:22:43.025
for themselves apart from prostitution

473
00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:44.785
or slavery if they were by themselves on their own.

474
00:22:45.565 --> 00:22:50.525
So this was a way to protect lives from tragedy like that.

475
00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:54.915
It it was also, you go back to early days,

476
00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:57.035
especially in history, when God says, be fruitful

477
00:22:57.035 --> 00:22:58.115
and multiply and fill the earth.

478
00:22:58.695 --> 00:23:00.515
It was a quicker way to do that actually.

479
00:23:00.615 --> 00:23:01.875
And, and it wasn't mean.

480
00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:03.115
It was always the right way,

481
00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.675
but it was the way that it could have happened.

482
00:23:07.025 --> 00:23:09.885
But, but in spite of all that, let me just be clear with

483
00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:13.965
what we believe about now, how God sees it

484
00:23:15.705 --> 00:23:16.725
as we move through the Bible.

485
00:23:16.835 --> 00:23:19.885
It's very clear that monogamy one man

486
00:23:19.885 --> 00:23:24.365
and one woman for life is conforming most closely

487
00:23:24.465 --> 00:23:25.885
to God's ideal for marriage.

488
00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:29.195
And just walk through the Bible.

489
00:23:29.195 --> 00:23:30.995
Genesis two, before the fall

490
00:23:31.095 --> 00:23:34.235
before sin into the world, the man was to leave his father

491
00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:36.395
and mother and take his wife singular.

492
00:23:38.105 --> 00:23:42.515
Even Deuteronomy 17, God commands the kings

493
00:23:42.815 --> 00:23:43.995
before they even had kings.

494
00:23:43.995 --> 00:23:47.405
He says, the kings must not take many wives

495
00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:49.725
because it's gonna go real bad for them if they do.

496
00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:53.855
Like I said, we're gonna see that in Second Samuel

497
00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.015
with David himself.

498
00:23:56.165 --> 00:23:58.105
And every other case it's

499
00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:01.835
trouble in the New Testament.

500
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:04.365
One example, the qualifications

501
00:24:04.385 --> 00:24:07.445
for leadership within the church, it says they are

502
00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:08.885
to be a one woman man.

503
00:24:09.185 --> 00:24:12.345
That's literally the phrase one woman man.

504
00:24:12.925 --> 00:24:14.385
And if, if elders

505
00:24:14.385 --> 00:24:18.455
and deacons in the church are to be examples morally,

506
00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:22.415
then if that's the standard for a leader, then

507
00:24:23.735 --> 00:24:25.375
everyone else called to follow that.

508
00:24:25.595 --> 00:24:27.295
It should be the same, right?

509
00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:29.455
One woman or, or one woman man

510
00:24:29.455 --> 00:24:31.535
or one man, woman, you might say, right?

511
00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:33.975
That's the picture. It paints Ephesians five.

512
00:24:33.975 --> 00:24:36.695
Think about that. The beautiful picture of marriage that it,

513
00:24:36.795 --> 00:24:41.135
it paints that it's a, an illustration of the gospel

514
00:24:42.445 --> 00:24:44.295
between Christ and his church.

515
00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:47.935
A husband and a wife are to illustrate that both practically

516
00:24:47.995 --> 00:24:49.215
and spiritually of

517
00:24:49.215 --> 00:24:51.335
how the gospel relationship with Christ works.

518
00:24:51.405 --> 00:24:53.615
Then you go to revelation, Jesus comes back

519
00:24:53.615 --> 00:24:54.895
for one bride, right?

520
00:24:54.955 --> 00:24:58.975
That's the picture we collectively paint of the whole.

521
00:24:59.195 --> 00:25:03.215
So while God seemed to allow it, we can't imitate it.

522
00:25:04.955 --> 00:25:06.785
While God seemed to allow these things

523
00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:09.105
to happen in the Old Testament, we can't imitate it

524
00:25:10.265 --> 00:25:13.675
because his ideal is one man and one woman for life.

525
00:25:14.235 --> 00:25:17.595
Anything else other than that causes heartache

526
00:25:17.735 --> 00:25:19.915
and it does not honor God

527
00:25:20.015 --> 00:25:22.515
or his design for how things are to work.

528
00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:27.225
So that's the way we would stand on that truth.

529
00:25:29.535 --> 00:25:31.395
But when we go back to one Samuel 30,

530
00:25:32.585 --> 00:25:36.255
these men coming back from battle clearly cared about their

531
00:25:36.575 --> 00:25:37.855
families, right?

532
00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:41.015
They, they were not just flippant about the relationships,

533
00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:43.175
they were distressed, they were hurt again.

534
00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:44.535
They even wanted to kill David

535
00:25:44.675 --> 00:25:45.775
for all this that had happened.

536
00:25:45.845 --> 00:25:47.415
They were ready to take his life.

537
00:25:47.835 --> 00:25:50.415
That's now the question, how is David gonna respond?

538
00:25:52.085 --> 00:25:54.385
It seemed like he was removed from the tension first.

539
00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:57.345
Now he's in a whole nother set of tension. What do I do now?

540
00:25:58.215 --> 00:26:03.145
How does he respond? Look at the end of verse six.

541
00:26:03.885 --> 00:26:08.165
But David strengthened

542
00:26:08.475 --> 00:26:11.645
himself in the Lord his God.

543
00:26:14.965 --> 00:26:17.665
He strengthened himself in all caps.

544
00:26:17.665 --> 00:26:22.065
Lord Yahweh, the ever present, saving one who was also his

545
00:26:22.805 --> 00:26:26.145
Elohim, saving Almighty God over all things.

546
00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:29.585
That's who he strengthened himself in.

547
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:32.545
And that inner courage that he gained from

548
00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:37.385
remembering his God again, that filling of his spirit again,

549
00:26:37.565 --> 00:26:38.945
led him to then verse seven.

550
00:26:39.285 --> 00:26:42.705
And David said to Abiathar, the priest, the son of a Alek,

551
00:26:43.015 --> 00:26:44.205
bring me the eod.

552
00:26:44.465 --> 00:26:46.605
So Abiathar brought the EOD to David.

553
00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:48.525
That's what they used to inquire of God.

554
00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:52.365
And David inquired of the Lord, shall I pursue

555
00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:54.165
after this band of Amalekites?

556
00:26:54.165 --> 00:26:58.825
Shall I overtake them? And God answered him, pursue

557
00:26:59.665 --> 00:27:02.125
for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue.

558
00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:10.235
So the contrast is that Saul had not done at all

559
00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:13.435
recently anything like this of seeking the Lord.

560
00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:15.755
David himself, even in chapter 27,

561
00:27:16.255 --> 00:27:17.875
did not seek the Lord when he ran

562
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:18.995
away to the Philistine country.

563
00:27:19.425 --> 00:27:23.675
Hear Finally we see it that David humbly

564
00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:25.955
pursued God again.

565
00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:33.485
He humbly sought the Lord, the pha, the priest.

566
00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:35.645
That's how they did it. But he, he said, God,

567
00:27:35.845 --> 00:27:37.005
I need you now.

568
00:27:38.245 --> 00:27:40.445
I recognize I need you.

569
00:27:40.675 --> 00:27:42.325
Look at David's transformation, right?

570
00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:45.425
This is the prodigal son's story.

571
00:27:45.565 --> 00:27:49.305
He trusted his own view of the situation he was in.

572
00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:52.705
He led that, led him to run into the wilderness.

573
00:27:53.365 --> 00:27:54.425
He looked at the stuff and

574
00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:55.545
he said, I, I gotta get outta here.

575
00:27:55.685 --> 00:27:58.385
Ran away. Now it is a new day.

576
00:27:58.735 --> 00:28:00.585
He's finally trusting in the Lord.

577
00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:05.195
Again, he's back to the David that we saw before.

578
00:28:05.265 --> 00:28:07.475
He's back to the David who grew up trusting the Lord,

579
00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:10.235
not leaning on his own understanding in all his ways,

580
00:28:10.235 --> 00:28:12.555
acknowledging God, making his path straight.

581
00:28:12.935 --> 00:28:15.915
That's what he now is back to.

582
00:28:20.345 --> 00:28:24.235
Not only did God's presence fall on him again,

583
00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:25.235
did God answer him?

584
00:28:25.775 --> 00:28:26.835
God said, go.

585
00:28:27.015 --> 00:28:28.635
And God in that going

586
00:28:29.235 --> 00:28:32.355
provided providentially the victory for David

587
00:28:35.045 --> 00:28:37.975
in this going, God said, I got you.

588
00:28:38.915 --> 00:28:40.175
And here's victory.

589
00:28:43.085 --> 00:28:44.825
I'm not gonna read chapter 30 as a whole.

590
00:28:44.905 --> 00:28:45.905
I encourage you to go back and read it,

591
00:28:45.905 --> 00:28:48.985
but it describes this providential victory.

592
00:28:50.105 --> 00:28:51.525
See, David and his men took off.

593
00:28:51.525 --> 00:28:52.805
They said, okay, we gotta chase

594
00:28:52.805 --> 00:28:56.365
after the Amalekites, as they went through the desert.

595
00:28:56.915 --> 00:28:59.565
They just happened upon a man in the middle

596
00:28:59.565 --> 00:29:03.045
of the desert sitting there who was an Egyptian slave left

597
00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:04.525
behind by the Amalekites.

598
00:29:05.075 --> 00:29:06.195
They left him to die.

599
00:29:06.385 --> 00:29:08.835
They just happened to, sorry, forget you we're outta here.

600
00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:10.075
David and his men, they

601
00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:11.235
don't know where the Amalekites went.

602
00:29:11.295 --> 00:29:13.955
So they're running through the desert in the middle of this

603
00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:15.835
huge expanse.

604
00:29:16.185 --> 00:29:19.305
They happened to cross this man who knew exactly

605
00:29:19.305 --> 00:29:21.785
where the Amalekites had gone, where they were going,

606
00:29:21.785 --> 00:29:22.945
how they were getting there, all of that.

607
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:27.265
And this man leads David and his men to the Amalekite camp.

608
00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:30.305
They crest the hill, they look down all their wives

609
00:29:30.305 --> 00:29:32.825
and children, all their stuff is still there.

610
00:29:33.245 --> 00:29:34.585
And they rejoice.

611
00:29:34.775 --> 00:29:37.025
They go down, take out the Amalekites

612
00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:38.425
and recover all their stuff.

613
00:29:38.565 --> 00:29:42.945
It says nothing was lost. Isn't God good?

614
00:29:44.955 --> 00:29:47.815
The tragedy they thought was happening, God

615
00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:50.065
collected it all back.

616
00:29:50.695 --> 00:29:53.385
This was the Lord's doing. We'll see David in a second.

617
00:29:53.385 --> 00:29:56.465
Attribute it to God. It was the Lord's doing. First.

618
00:29:56.485 --> 00:29:58.265
He provided the wisdom and courage to go.

619
00:29:59.155 --> 00:30:01.625
David said, do I go? He said, yes, you're gonna win.

620
00:30:02.245 --> 00:30:04.185
And then it also was that God

621
00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:05.865
provided this man in the middle of the desert

622
00:30:06.645 --> 00:30:08.385
who knew exactly where the enemy had gone.

623
00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:11.875
All that happens. And then not only that,

624
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:14.635
they defeated the Amalekites, recovered everything.

625
00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:18.755
Think about the party they would've thrown in relation

626
00:30:18.755 --> 00:30:22.035
to God's grace to them, right?

627
00:30:22.035 --> 00:30:25.595
They had it all. God led them.

628
00:30:26.145 --> 00:30:28.235
They didn't, the the am Malachi didn't even have time

629
00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:31.155
to do anything bad to the people that they had stolen.

630
00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:36.865
God provided all right there. They didn't have to worry.

631
00:30:38.235 --> 00:30:39.865
Think of the party when they get back home.

632
00:30:39.865 --> 00:30:40.865
They got all their stuff back.

633
00:30:40.865 --> 00:30:43.225
They got all their people back. Like, praise God.

634
00:30:45.415 --> 00:30:47.595
It it, it reminds me of Luke 15,

635
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:49.735
the parable of the prodigal son.

636
00:30:51.045 --> 00:30:54.965
When the father throws a huge party of celebration,

637
00:30:54.965 --> 00:30:58.165
that his son who was dead is now alive again.

638
00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:02.975
He's home. God says there's a party in heaven

639
00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:05.455
for thought every time a sinner repents.

640
00:31:05.475 --> 00:31:07.415
That's the kind of party you can imagine.

641
00:31:07.785 --> 00:31:09.415
God's grace to them would've prompted.

642
00:31:10.595 --> 00:31:12.855
And so David's heart is changing, right?

643
00:31:13.525 --> 00:31:17.335
He's, he's conforming back to God's plan for him.

644
00:31:17.335 --> 00:31:18.695
And we actually see one more glimpse of

645
00:31:18.695 --> 00:31:20.135
that at the end of chapter 30.

646
00:31:20.955 --> 00:31:24.855
See, David and his men returned with all their resources,

647
00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:25.975
all the people, all those things.

648
00:31:26.235 --> 00:31:29.135
But some of his men had stayed behind.

649
00:31:30.535 --> 00:31:32.465
They were too exhausted to go into the battle.

650
00:31:32.495 --> 00:31:35.625
They just stayed. And so as the, the rest

651
00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:37.265
of the armies bringing the stuff

652
00:31:37.285 --> 00:31:40.585
and people back with them, some of the men who had gone

653
00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:42.425
to the battle were grumbling that man,

654
00:31:42.425 --> 00:31:44.905
we shouldn't give those guys anything.

655
00:31:45.495 --> 00:31:47.745
They didn't battle like we did. They stayed behind.

656
00:31:47.745 --> 00:31:49.345
They were too tired, they're weak.

657
00:31:49.455 --> 00:31:50.865
Give 'em their wives and children back.

658
00:31:50.965 --> 00:31:52.225
But other than that, give them nothing.

659
00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:56.485
The Bible refers to them as worthless fellows who said that.

660
00:31:58.525 --> 00:32:00.705
But watch David his response,

661
00:32:02.465 --> 00:32:04.815
verse 23 of chapter 30.

662
00:32:07.995 --> 00:32:11.415
But David said, you shall not do so, my brothers, with

663
00:32:11.525 --> 00:32:14.135
what the Lord has given us.

664
00:32:15.635 --> 00:32:18.505
Again, we didn't earn this. We didn't gain. This is God.

665
00:32:20.085 --> 00:32:22.295
He's preserved us, given into our hand.

666
00:32:22.295 --> 00:32:24.495
The band that came against us who would listen

667
00:32:24.495 --> 00:32:26.575
to you in this matter for as his share is

668
00:32:26.575 --> 00:32:27.815
who goes down into the battle.

669
00:32:28.195 --> 00:32:31.295
So shall hear his share be who stays by the baggage.

670
00:32:31.485 --> 00:32:32.935
They shall share alike.

671
00:32:34.075 --> 00:32:36.855
So David knew this was all Gods to begin with. What right?

672
00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:38.735
Do I have to distribute it according to what I think?

673
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.125
Think no. I'm going to humbly obey the Lord in sharing it

674
00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:44.485
with everybody who was a part of this.

675
00:32:45.255 --> 00:32:48.905
Everybody in my camp, everybody gets an equal share.

676
00:32:49.245 --> 00:32:52.225
He humbly obeyed God. Why did I say it that way?

677
00:32:54.095 --> 00:32:56.305
Because that's what a king's supposed to do.

678
00:32:58.865 --> 00:33:02.165
That's what a king God's command for a king was.

679
00:33:02.185 --> 00:33:06.125
To be caring for his people, caring for his men,

680
00:33:06.185 --> 00:33:07.405
caring for his families.

681
00:33:07.405 --> 00:33:08.925
That's what a king was supposed to do.

682
00:33:09.075 --> 00:33:11.565
Even sharing spoil with some of the people in Judah

683
00:33:11.565 --> 00:33:12.645
that aren't even there.

684
00:33:12.875 --> 00:33:14.245
He's like, Hey guys, I'm not against you.

685
00:33:14.465 --> 00:33:17.325
He was using it to care for his brothers

686
00:33:17.325 --> 00:33:19.565
and sisters even over there who are against him.

687
00:33:20.275 --> 00:33:21.615
That's what a king is supposed to do.

688
00:33:23.265 --> 00:33:25.895
David humbly obeyed God.

689
00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:30.815
This is a picture of a man prepared for the throne.

690
00:33:33.095 --> 00:33:34.795
All the tests, all the things

691
00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:35.875
that God had brought him through.

692
00:33:36.055 --> 00:33:39.915
He has finally been prepared to take the throne.

693
00:33:43.045 --> 00:33:46.045
A very different picture than we'll see from Saul over the

694
00:33:46.045 --> 00:33:50.265
next two weeks as David comes towards the throne.

695
00:33:53.415 --> 00:33:55.395
Now, here's the question we've asked a number of times.

696
00:33:55.395 --> 00:33:56.755
What do we do with all this ourselves?

697
00:33:57.565 --> 00:33:59.965
I mean, that's a really cool story. It's fun.

698
00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:04.755
Uh, I love that passage, but what do we do with it?

699
00:34:06.805 --> 00:34:09.775
Well, I mentioned Luke 15, Jesus parable, the prodigal son.

700
00:34:10.325 --> 00:34:12.495
It's similar because that parable,

701
00:34:12.495 --> 00:34:14.295
if you read it later today

702
00:34:14.295 --> 00:34:17.975
and you go study it, it creates some big questions

703
00:34:18.715 --> 00:34:20.975
in our minds, in our hearts.

704
00:34:22.555 --> 00:34:26.695
I think this does too. Some questions that we need to as,

705
00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:30.415
as we look at David, how, how he initially responded to God,

706
00:34:30.795 --> 00:34:34.095
how he initially responded to tense situations in his life.

707
00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:38.855
As we reflect, consider our own reactions,

708
00:34:40.045 --> 00:34:41.305
it raises some big questions.

709
00:34:41.305 --> 00:34:43.785
And here's the first one that you can ask yourself,

710
00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:45.265
that I can ask myself.

711
00:34:47.865 --> 00:34:50.485
How am I leaning on my own understanding?

712
00:34:53.665 --> 00:34:58.445
How am I leaning on my own understanding when I look

713
00:34:58.785 --> 00:35:01.485
at the circumstances in front of me, in

714
00:35:04.025 --> 00:35:07.545
I leaning on my own perceptions of that?

715
00:35:09.615 --> 00:35:13.375
Or am I trusting the ever present

716
00:35:13.795 --> 00:35:17.135
yet all powerful God and His path for me?

717
00:35:17.945 --> 00:35:21.405
Which 1:00 AM I? Am I trusting myself or am I trusting God?

718
00:35:21.545 --> 00:35:24.005
My limited view, my limited glimpse of everything I see?

719
00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:26.045
Or am I trusting God's holistic,

720
00:35:26.045 --> 00:35:27.845
eternal, infinite view of that?

721
00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:31.475
Because watch, right?

722
00:35:32.085 --> 00:35:35.675
Watch how essential Proverbs three, five

723
00:35:35.695 --> 00:35:36.715
and six then becomes.

724
00:35:37.245 --> 00:35:38.925
I know it's familiar, we put it on your notes,

725
00:35:39.185 --> 00:35:40.765
but watch how essential this is.

726
00:35:41.175 --> 00:35:43.085
Trust in the Lord with all your heart.

727
00:35:43.505 --> 00:35:47.125
Do not lean on your own understanding in all your ways.

728
00:35:47.475 --> 00:35:50.765
Acknowledge him and he will make straight your path.

729
00:35:54.905 --> 00:35:56.505
Remember what happened when David trusted his own

730
00:35:56.505 --> 00:35:58.735
understanding what happened?

731
00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:02.655
Scared runs in the wilderness, creates an

732
00:36:03.175 --> 00:36:05.095
seemingly impossible situation for himself.

733
00:36:05.275 --> 00:36:07.495
He lived in fear and everyone suffered

734
00:36:07.515 --> 00:36:08.655
around him because of it.

735
00:36:10.215 --> 00:36:11.665
When he trusted his own, understand.

736
00:36:13.595 --> 00:36:18.085
Yet, when he finally humbled himself to acknowledge

737
00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:19.765
and seek the Lord,

738
00:36:20.115 --> 00:36:22.925
what happened when he began really listening

739
00:36:22.925 --> 00:36:24.485
to really trusting the Lord?

740
00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:28.045
What happened? God straightened out his path,

741
00:36:29.335 --> 00:36:33.225
brought victory, showed in the way, blessed him in grace.

742
00:36:36.085 --> 00:36:39.025
So you need to answer, you need to answer that question.

743
00:36:39.685 --> 00:36:42.675
You need to ask yourself,

744
00:36:43.365 --> 00:36:46.955
where in my life am I leaning on my own understanding?

745
00:36:49.975 --> 00:36:53.315
Am I seeing this situation from God's perspective or mine?

746
00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:58.215
Am I responding to that person out

747
00:36:58.215 --> 00:37:01.095
of a trust in the Lord, in a godly way?

748
00:37:01.315 --> 00:37:04.415
Or am I responding to that person in a worldly way to try

749
00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:06.415
to manipulate something that I can get out of it?

750
00:37:09.015 --> 00:37:11.315
Am I living in fear that I'm going

751
00:37:11.315 --> 00:37:13.395
to be single the rest of my life?

752
00:37:13.575 --> 00:37:15.715
Or am I trusting God's good plan

753
00:37:15.735 --> 00:37:17.315
for his glory through my life?

754
00:37:19.335 --> 00:37:20.595
And we could keep going on

755
00:37:20.595 --> 00:37:21.795
and on through all kinds of things,

756
00:37:21.895 --> 00:37:24.035
but it's not just the big things.

757
00:37:24.305 --> 00:37:26.195
It's the smallest things in our lives.

758
00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:27.755
Am I trusting my own understanding

759
00:37:27.755 --> 00:37:30.115
and how I use the money God's entrusted to me?

760
00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:34.155
The time I have every day, my attitude, my focus?

761
00:37:34.535 --> 00:37:37.835
Am I trusting my own understanding of how to live my life?

762
00:37:38.095 --> 00:37:40.315
Or am I trusting his plan?

763
00:37:44.005 --> 00:37:48.785
I think if we're honest, we would all say

764
00:37:50.395 --> 00:37:51.605
that we're prone to wander.

765
00:37:53.615 --> 00:37:56.525
We're prone to leave the God we say we love

766
00:37:58.495 --> 00:38:01.955
his path, his straight way.

767
00:38:03.255 --> 00:38:05.605
We're prone to wander all over the place.

768
00:38:05.605 --> 00:38:08.685
That's why the second question is just as vital, how

769
00:38:10.535 --> 00:38:13.355
do I need to then return to the Lord?

770
00:38:17.405 --> 00:38:19.065
If my propensity is to wander?

771
00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.225
How do I need to return to the Lord?

772
00:38:23.455 --> 00:38:25.345
Like David finally did, right?

773
00:38:26.945 --> 00:38:29.475
Like, like the prodigal son finally did.

774
00:38:29.475 --> 00:38:31.315
After wasting his life in the wilderness,

775
00:38:31.315 --> 00:38:34.395
wasting all the inheritance, he finally runs

776
00:38:35.115 --> 00:38:36.405
back to his Father.

777
00:38:36.665 --> 00:38:41.635
How do I need to return? Ask yourself And listen.

778
00:38:41.685 --> 00:38:46.155
Maybe you have run down your path for a long time

779
00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:49.525
and you have run that path headlong

780
00:38:49.625 --> 00:38:50.965
as far away from your father,

781
00:38:51.265 --> 00:38:52.765
as far away from God as you can.

782
00:38:52.905 --> 00:38:56.165
And you've run that path as long and hard as you can,

783
00:38:56.385 --> 00:38:59.725
and you've tried to fill your soul with empty things.

784
00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:01.445
Is there any hope for you?

785
00:39:04.195 --> 00:39:07.555
I would submit to you, yes there is,

786
00:39:09.105 --> 00:39:11.275
because maybe you've run that path.

787
00:39:11.475 --> 00:39:12.795
'cause you didn't know there was another one.

788
00:39:12.935 --> 00:39:16.075
You didn't know that you could be near to your Father God,

789
00:39:16.135 --> 00:39:17.875
you didn't know that you could know God.

790
00:39:18.095 --> 00:39:21.235
And now all of a sudden you're awakening to this reality is

791
00:39:21.235 --> 00:39:22.635
that you can know God.

792
00:39:22.695 --> 00:39:24.475
You're seeing it for the first time.

793
00:39:24.655 --> 00:39:26.715
You can have a relationship with the eternal God

794
00:39:26.715 --> 00:39:29.635
of the universe and the, you know, you know how to do that.

795
00:39:29.735 --> 00:39:33.435
The way you do that is you turn from your selfish way,

796
00:39:33.695 --> 00:39:35.595
you turn from yourself and your sin,

797
00:39:35.735 --> 00:39:38.515
and you turn to Jesus in his life, death

798
00:39:38.515 --> 00:39:39.515
and resurrection for you.

799
00:39:41.075 --> 00:39:42.895
And he says, you're mine now.

800
00:39:44.665 --> 00:39:48.085
All through his love, in his death on the cross for you,

801
00:39:48.305 --> 00:39:51.205
he says, your mine now and you're on his path.

802
00:39:54.505 --> 00:39:58.505
But I know that probably more likely here is

803
00:39:58.505 --> 00:40:02.975
that you are a son or daughter of God, yet you have felt

804
00:40:03.635 --> 00:40:08.015
for years, months, weeks, whatever, this slow fade

805
00:40:09.025 --> 00:40:10.735
drift into that wilderness

806
00:40:13.205 --> 00:40:17.115
and you're exhausted and you are dry

807
00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:21.395
and you're empty and you feel like every decision you're

808
00:40:21.395 --> 00:40:24.235
making just keeps putting you deeper into the mess

809
00:40:25.145 --> 00:40:26.525
and the tension of

810
00:40:26.525 --> 00:40:30.175
life is there hope for you.

811
00:40:34.995 --> 00:40:37.505
Trust in the Lord with all your heart.

812
00:40:40.095 --> 00:40:43.685
Again, what that means is like as God enables you to do it,

813
00:40:43.865 --> 00:40:45.765
you refocus regularly.

814
00:40:45.765 --> 00:40:47.885
You draw near to him 'cause he's gonna draw near to you.

815
00:40:47.885 --> 00:40:51.445
James says he's going to want you and you want him.

816
00:40:51.585 --> 00:40:54.805
And it begins to trust him with all your heart, more

817
00:40:54.805 --> 00:40:55.965
and more and more throughout your life.

818
00:40:55.975 --> 00:40:57.005
Trust him with all your heart

819
00:40:57.105 --> 00:41:00.125
and lean not on your own understanding.

820
00:41:01.565 --> 00:41:04.935
Like stop listening to the lies of the world, of your flesh,

821
00:41:05.275 --> 00:41:08.495
of the enemy humbly submit to say, God,

822
00:41:08.615 --> 00:41:10.095
I don't have any clue what I'm doing.

823
00:41:10.975 --> 00:41:13.985
I need you. I'm make a mess of it.

824
00:41:14.345 --> 00:41:16.665
I cannot lean on my own understanding. I need yours.

825
00:41:16.945 --> 00:41:18.185
I need yours through your word.

826
00:41:18.345 --> 00:41:21.665
I need your understanding in all your ways. Acknowledge him.

827
00:41:22.055 --> 00:41:24.105
That means sinner your life around His word,

828
00:41:24.205 --> 00:41:26.905
his His lordship in your life, his love for you.

829
00:41:26.955 --> 00:41:30.145
Everything around you is for him and through him.

830
00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:32.505
And as you do all that, Proverbs three,

831
00:41:32.845 --> 00:41:37.585
he will make straight your path drifts.

832
00:41:37.585 --> 00:41:40.105
You're all over the place. Trust the Lord.

833
00:41:40.355 --> 00:41:42.585
Don't lean your understanding, ignore your ways,

834
00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:46.985
acknowledge him and he will straighten out your path.

835
00:41:47.405 --> 00:41:51.425
So here's the question. Why don't you run home today?

836
00:41:54.755 --> 00:41:58.335
Why don't you run home? Your father is waiting.

837
00:41:59.495 --> 00:42:01.105
Your father is there.

838
00:42:01.325 --> 00:42:05.765
His loving arms wide offering you

839
00:42:05.835 --> 00:42:07.565
something that the wilderness

840
00:42:07.565 --> 00:42:09.925
of this world can never offer you.

841
00:42:10.235 --> 00:42:12.445
He's offering it to you if you would just run home.

842
00:42:16.015 --> 00:42:20.165
So run home today, friend, wherever you have been,

843
00:42:20.805 --> 00:42:24.205
whatever you have done, run home to him today.

844
00:42:27.215 --> 00:42:30.835
In fact, the the Lord's Supper actually is a means

845
00:42:31.255 --> 00:42:32.595
for us to do that.

846
00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:37.065
And so I'm gonna invite Aaron, one of our elders up here

847
00:42:37.205 --> 00:42:39.305
to walk us through this, but,

848
00:42:39.365 --> 00:42:40.465
but use this time

849
00:42:42.485 --> 00:42:45.145
to run home, whatever way that means for you.

850
00:42:45.245 --> 00:42:46.945
Run home to him today.
