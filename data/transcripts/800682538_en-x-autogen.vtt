1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.200
For the grace of God offers salvation

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.700
to all people teaching us

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.000
to live Godly life.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.600
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us and to

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.400
purify for himself a people that

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.500
are his very own.

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.600
For we ourselves were once foolish.

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.100
disobedient

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.100
let us stray.

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.200
slaves to various passions and pleasures

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.500
passing our days in Malice and envy

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000
hated by others and hating one another

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.500
but

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.900
when the goodness and loving kindness of God our savior appeared

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.200
he saved us.

16
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.400
Not because of Works done by us in righteousness. But

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.900
according to his own Mercy.

18
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.100
By the washing of regeneration and renewal of

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.700
the Holy Spirit.

20
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.400
Whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.200
Our Savior.

22
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.700
So that being justified by his grace we

23
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.600
might become heirs according to the hope of

24
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.700
eternal life.

25
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.100
It's not so rich.

26
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.100
so deep

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900
so incredibly beautiful.

28
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.100
Taking us from death to life from Darkness

29
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.500
to light all by the grace and mercy

30
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.800
of God our savior.

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.300
Now, I know it sounds like a broken record every week. It's

32
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
the same message that you get here at Henderson Hills and

33
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.500
it's not because we can't come up with something more creative. It's because

34
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.900
we Delight in it so much.

35
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.100
And it's so wonderful because it's all of God.

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.500
It's not by works.

37
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.200
It's not by any goodness in ourselves. It was

38
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200
all according to his Mercy.

39
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.300
and listen that truth

40
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.300
if anything

41
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400
should stun us.

42
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.300
Right shouldn't it it lead us to humility.

43
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.100
surrender to Brokenness

44
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.400
There's a lot of talk about Revival and Awakening going on in our land right

45
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.800
now a lot of conversations about that but hear me the

46
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.600
only way that that truly comes is

47
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
through individuals humbly repenting and

48
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.600
being broken before the Lord.

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
It's through you and me saying God we

50
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
want nothing else but you through US

51
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.300
breaking our hearts before him and letting

52
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.300
him break our hearts and surrendering to him. That's the only way

53
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.900
this happens.

54
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.400
In fact, would you pray?

55
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.100
daily

56
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.700
that God would do that in US.

57
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.300
That this is not just business as usual that we don't just go through

58
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.000
the motions of being Christians in America.

59
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.200
That's something truly changes.

60
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.200
In fact, let's pray for that right now. I don't know why we would wait.

61
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.100
Let's pray right now God. Thank you for this this moment

62
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.400
that you have ordained. This is not an accident

63
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.900
that every one of us is here or watching. It's it's that you

64
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.200
have

65
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.300
put us here and you've put this text and

66
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.500
and your glory in front of us God.

67
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.800
so Lord, I pray as

68
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.400
as it's so easy for us to come into

69
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.600
this room or or go through the motions and

70
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.100
just think it's another thing.

71
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500
Don't let us.

72
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.700
Stagnate God don't let us be content

73
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.300
with the same thing.

74
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.200
But drive us back to your word back to

75
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.500
the depths of the Gospel the good news.

76
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.800
Of your grace and mercy and our place.

77
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.800
Break us.

78
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.300
Break our hearts God open our hands.

79
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.500
Thank you that that's what these students have been hearing all weekend of

80
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.600
of how it's not about being a superhero of

81
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.000
Faith. It's just doing the normal God

82
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.100
designed things to do daily in

83
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.300
faith.

84
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.800
And you transform the world through that.

85
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.100
God awaken their hearts may may this start

86
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.600
as it has throughout history in our

87
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.000
young people.

88
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.300
And flood through our church God that

89
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.300
they awaken to the fact that Jesus you're worth it.

90
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.000
To give everything away.

91
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.300
To count Our Lives as nothing and say Jesus you are

92
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.600
better.

93
00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.900
What do you want me to do?

94
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.500
every moment every day every year

95
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.200
What do you want?

96
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.000
Me that be true of all of us.

97
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.500
Start with this Lord.

98
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400
You've brought us to this moment. And so

99
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.900
God show us what you want for each of us.

100
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.000
Start with me.

101
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.500
Start with us that our church is different

102
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.700
because of you.

103
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.400
Help us God.

104
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.600
If you're not already there.

105
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.900
Titus 3 that's where we're going to be today.

106
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.600
Titus 3 1 through 8

107
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.300
I've read most of it. We've read it a couple times actually because it's so

108
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.400
good. But this is the whole passage Titus 3 1 through

109
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.500
8.

110
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.600
Paul writing to Titus on Crete says remind them to

111
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.900
be submissive to rulers and authorities to obedient

112
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.400
to be ready for every good work to speak

113
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.400
evil of no one to avoid quarreling to

114
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.300
be gentle and to show perfect courtesy toward all

115
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.400
people.

116
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.800
Four we ourselves were once foolish disobedient

117
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.500
LED astray slaves to various passions and Pleasures

118
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.400
passing our days in Malice and envy hated by

119
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.400
others hating one another but when the goodness

120
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.300
and loving kindness of God our savior appeared he saved us

121
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300
not because of Works done by us and righteousness. But

122
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.700
according to his own Mercy by the washing regeneration

123
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.800
renewal the Holy Spirit.

124
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.600
Whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ Our Savior.

125
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.900
So that being justified by his grace we might become heirs

126
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.100
according to the hope of eternal life.

127
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.200
The sayings trustworthy and I want you to insist on these

128
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.300
things so that those who have believed in God

129
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.500
may be careful to devote themselves to

130
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.200
Good Works.

131
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.300
These things are excellent and profitable for

132
00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.500
people.

133
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.600
Now you notice a couple times this passage talks about Good Works.

134
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.800
But you saw it clearly in verse 5 that nothing in

135
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.800
those good works actually bring Salvation.

136
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.000
You've got to keep that in mind the rest of today. I know

137
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.600
James 2 says faith without works is dead. It's useless

138
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.200
but that doesn't contradict what Ephesians chapter 2

139
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.400
verses 8 9 say about why Works can't

140
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.600
save you it says by Grace you've been saved through faith.

141
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.400
This is not your own doing. It's the gift of God not

142
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.400
a result of works so that no one can boast.

143
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.900
See, that's the point. If you could save yourself then you

144
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.000
could boast about it. You'd be the one

145
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.100
getting Glory but God says no, I want the glory. I am the one

146
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.600
worthy of glory. And so I'm Gonna Save you not by

147
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.200
anything you did.

148
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.900
And so if Works don't save us then what are they for?

149
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.100
What James meant is that they are the confirmation of

150
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.400
your faith in Jesus. They go together faith and

151
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.000
works go together. They're what God uniquely designed

152
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.400
each one of us to do in

153
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.300
order to bless those around us.

154
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.700
That's what Ephesians 2:10 continues. He says for

155
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.200
we are God's workmanship created in

156
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.100
Christ Jesus for good works.

157
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.400
Which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them?

158
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.200
And so you see this is part of the deal somehow good works

159
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.300
works into this thing, right?

160
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.500
Well, here's how you could remember. This is the the main thing

161
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.400
if you walk away remembering nothing else kind of remember this as you

162
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.800
walk away clearly we saw here that God does not

163
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.200
need your good works.

164
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.700
But your neighbor does.

165
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.100
But your neighbor does.

166
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.500
God doesn't need it like you you can't offer anything to God.

167
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.400
You can't earn anything from God so he doesn't need them.

168
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.800
But as you surrender to him.

169
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.800
in humility

170
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.500
as you live a sacrificial life and response to

171
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.200
his grace.

172
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.700
Those people around you are recipients of

173
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.000
God's blessing through you.

174
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.400
That's why good works are a part of this equation.

175
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.300
God doesn't need them, but your neighbor does.

176
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.400
So here in this passage, just like last week we come back

177
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.300
to the same thing over and over again every week. But but the

178
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.600
Apostle Paul last week spent a good chunk of the verses just

179
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.200
exalting in the grace of God celebrating the

180
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.100
gospel, right?

181
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.200
That he was reminding the church Jesus life death and

182
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.300
Resurrection in their place is why this thing works? It's the

183
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.200
whole point of all of it. I don't think here in chapter 3,

184
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.800
he forgot that he wrote it a couple sentences early. He's just

185
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.300
saying it again because it's that important.

186
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.500
He just says it again. He's like the gospel. And

187
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.400
then this is what you do the gospel. And this is what you do. It's that

188
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.400
important because we cannot forget this that the gospel is

189
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.900
the source of all of this.

190
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.500
in everything the rest of today this whole thing falls apart without

191
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.500
the gospel being the source the foundation The

192
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.400
Rock on which we stand and we know it's the

193
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.400
source of all of this because of the first word of verse 3.

194
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.500
It's the word for f o r.

195
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.100
Remember, that's a linking word.

196
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.400
That means whatever. He just said

197
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.500
is dependent on what he's about to say.

198
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.100
So in verses 1 and 2 he laid out a series of indicatives. He said

199
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.600
do this do this do this.

200
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.000
And then verse 3 begins with that word for because

201
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.700
in order that so you would say do all

202
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.400
these things why because or do

203
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.000
all these things. How because

204
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500
and what does he say next?

205
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.200
the gospel

206
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.200
versus three through seven is a

207
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.900
truth. That should change the entire orientation

208
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.100
of Our Lives.

209
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.100
Do all these things not just to do them because of

210
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.100
the gospel. And so we do this

211
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.500
every week. I know it sounds like a broken record, but we treasure it. It's our

212
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.200
source. So we are going to just marvel again at the

213
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.100
gospel because the scripture does

214
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.300
But here's how we're going to do it this interesting. The way Paul goes

215
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.100
about this and Titus 3. Is he he kind of

216
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.800
sets up this picture of three men now

217
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.900
women you're included in this men man meaning like

218
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.500
person human.

219
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.500
You might think of it that way and so first you'll see what I mean. When

220
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.000
I get there first in verse 3 Paul described

221
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.600
what he refers to as the old

222
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.000
man.

223
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.600
The old person the old man is what we

224
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.200
might say here and so look again at verse

225
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.300
3. This is what I mean the old person of Who

226
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:04.500
We Are

227
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.000
For we ourselves were once foolish disobedient. Let

228
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.300
us stray slaves to various passions and

229
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.600
Pleasures passing our days and Malice or anger and

230
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.500
envy hated by others and hating one

231
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.000
another.

232
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.600
Cuts that's a pretty pretty Stark picture, right?

233
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.700
This is a lost person is what he says.

234
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.900
But really hear me, this is all of us.

235
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.000
Before we meet Christ notice. He says we ourselves he's

236
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.600
including himself. He's including the Crete and Believers because

237
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.300
remember where they were saved from in chapter 1 verse 12,

238
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.400
they were lazy. They were evil beasts lazy

239
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.500
gluttons, right? They were they were these people that were all known

240
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.800
for their sin.

241
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.900
and then he says but we

242
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.100
ourselves

243
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.200
all of us are included in that now you might have read that.

244
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.900
That verse 3 you might have read that and thought wow that that sure

245
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.000
is pretty extreme.

246
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.200
It's pretty hard. Like that's not I don't see that a lot

247
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.600
anywhere.

248
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.200
Now I'll give it to you that there are varying degrees of how

249
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.200
this plays out in the world today. Right not all of us are addicted to

250
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.200
meth not everybody's Hitler right? Like we know that not

251
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.700
everybody gets fired for outbursts at work, right? There are levels

252
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.100
of how this plays out in our lives.

253
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.100
But here's how I see it most often today in our

254
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.300
world.

255
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.000
Our context most people are like me when I was

256
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:34.300
growing up.

257
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.600
learning how to manage

258
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.200
all of that

259
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.500
old man stuff

260
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.300
and manipulate it in such a way to look religious so

261
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.200
that you get what you want in the end.

262
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200
And it's all about self.

263
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.400
So yeah, you don't look like all that the wickedness out there, but you

264
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.200
look the same in the end.

265
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.900
disobedient

266
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.500
the parents right? Because no matter how this plays out. It's still in

267
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.100
there. Right? We're all disobedient to parents. We cheat on tests. We

268
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.500
lie to people right that's in here. We foolishly follow

269
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.800
selfish desires that's in here. We

270
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.600
put other people down to lift ourselves up that's in

271
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.700
here.

272
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.500
This is all of us. This is the old man.

273
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.200
This is every lost person in the world. This is the

274
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.600
lifestyle that First Corinthians 6 says will not inherit

275
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.300
the kingdom of God.

276
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.800
And it's not just the bad stuff out there. It's every little

277
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.400
Nuance we could find in

278
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.800
that that this is what keeps us from the kingdom of

279
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.500
God, maybe.

280
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.100
Maybe you see yourself there today.

281
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.600
maybe look at that verse and you're thinking that's

282
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.900
who I am.

283
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.100
And you've tried everything you can't get out of

284
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.300
it.

285
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.300
You've tried to be religious you've tried to go to Camp. You've tried to do all the

286
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.500
things and and nothing has worked and you cannot get out. Well

287
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.200
thankfully hear me that does not have to be the end of

288
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.700
your story.

289
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.200
Thankfully for all that's not the end of the story here

290
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.400
right verse 4 has a great word to start it off. We

291
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.500
saw the first word of verse 3.

292
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.400
This one's three letters as well the first word of verse

293
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.700
4 b u t.

294
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.500
And that word means that something difference coming.

295
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.700
Right something different is next what I just said, actually there's

296
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.700
something different and just like Titus 2:11 said

297
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.300
something different showed up not just something

298
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.000
different was next something different showed up. Look at

299
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.000
Titus 3:4.

300
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.400
but when the goodness and loving kindness

301
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.200
of God our savior appeared

302
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.600
now remember that wasn't just a theory.

303
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.900
That was actually a person.

304
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.400
When Grace appeared that was talking about Jesus same kind

305
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.100
of thing here verse 5 starts with the fact that he saved

306
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.300
us. So goodness loving kindness showed up, but

307
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.300
it was a person. That's Jesus.

308
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.000
He showed up.

309
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.400
Means he is Grace. He is goodness. He is

310
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.800
loving kindness all those things that showed up he is

311
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.600
that

312
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.200
and so yes Paul describes in verse 3

313
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.400
the old man. This is what it looks like to be lost. But here

314
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.700
in verse 4 the god Man shows up.

315
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.100
The old man was this way the god Man shows up

316
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.500
to do something different. That's Jesus. Right? That's fully God

317
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.500
fully man in one Jesus Christ.

318
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.600
Who shows up and changes everything?

319
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.900
Says he brought Grace as a gift.

320
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.000
Showing a Salvation is not by our own efforts.

321
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.200
It's a gift you just receive but he also

322
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.000
it says here he brought Mercy.

323
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.700
Now grace and mercy think of a coin these are the opposite

324
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.800
sides of the same coin grace and mercy.

325
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.100
And here's how you can think about it Grace.

326
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.000
Is where you get what you don't deserve.

327
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.400
Right God's grace. He just gives it to

328
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.000
us. We don't deserve anything, but he says here salvation. That's

329
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.600
Grace.

330
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.700
The flip side is Mercy.

331
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.200
Which is not getting what you do

332
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:29.800
deserve.

333
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.100
We've all experienced that at some point in our lives whether it's from a parent

334
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.700
or from a teacher or something where where you know, I blew

335
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:38.700
it.

336
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.300
And I should get this discipline. I

337
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.800
should get this and they say you know what?

338
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.900
I'm Gonna Give You Mercy today in this moment and

339
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.000
you don't get what you do deserve.

340
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.300
This is what God came to do.

341
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.400
He gave Grace and he gave

342
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.300
mercy and how'd he do all that verse 5 by the

343
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.100
washing of regeneration and renewal of the

344
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.000
Holy Spirit see in your sin. You deserve wrath

345
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.600
and judgment forever, but

346
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.400
God said, no instead. I'm going to take

347
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.000
your nasty sin clothes. I'm gonna

348
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.700
throw him into the washing machine of heaven and I'm gonna wash them clean not

349
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.400
by bleach, but by my own blood

350
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.200
and he gonna take him out. He's gonna re-cloth you and you're

351
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.200
gonna be perfect and you're gonna be new Snow White

352
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.900
completely white knew.

353
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.400
That's what he did.

354
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.200
in Mercy

355
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.900
Because you deserve.

356
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.000
to be condemned

357
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.900
But he didn't.

358
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.000
Instead he graciously gives salvation.

359
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.600
And notice he did all of that.

360
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.500
He did all of that to take that old man. That's you

361
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.200
and me in our sin. He took that old man and make each of

362
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.100
us a new man in him.

363
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.400
This is the third part old man. God Man shows

364
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.600
up now new man.

365
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.600
So what sync Corinthians 5:17 says?

366
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.600
Therefore if anyone is in Christ. He

367
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.800
is a new creation.

368
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.800
the old has passed away behold the

369
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.100
new

370
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.500
has come

371
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:26.700
the old man

372
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.500
You don't have to follow it anymore.

373
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.300
It's gone. It's done. God man says

374
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.100
you're a new man.

375
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.700
That's what he's done including in one really key

376
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.300
aspect here.

377
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.400
It's in Titus 3:7. He says so that we might become heirs.

378
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.100
Not Air Jordans, but Heir heirs.

379
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.000
And what's an error?

380
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.400
An air is is someone who's been named

381
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.900
to be in line for an inheritance?

382
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.300
Somebody who's probably in the family already, but if

383
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.400
not, they've been kind of brought into the family and put in the line to

384
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.500
say you're going to get this when I die or when I leave you're

385
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.300
gonna get your inheritance.

386
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.000
Now this we could camp on this theme for weeks. There's

387
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.600
so much here, but just think for a

388
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:17.700
second.

389
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.500
So that we would become heirs. Think about what that means Church.

390
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.200
You were separated from God in your sin.

391
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.600
You could do nothing about it.

392
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.100
The gulf was way too far.

393
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.800
You were his enemy.

394
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.300
In your sin.

395
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:40.800
Yet.

396
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.400
In his goodness and loving kindness.

397
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.000
He chose you to be in his

398
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.600
family.

399
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.100
And he paid for you to be in his

400
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.100
family with his son's life.

401
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.600
Like you see that do you see like and we're

402
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.300
not talking about just some kind of like Mafia Family like you're in

403
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.300
the family now like we're not talking about that. We're talking about you're in

404
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.600
God's family forever and ever with him as

405
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.500
his beloved child.

406
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.500
You were an enemy.

407
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.600
And you couldn't earn your way. You couldn't build a bridge across he

408
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.300
made the way by his own son sacrifice

409
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.000
on the cross.

410
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.200
To bring you back to him. What

411
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.300
great news is that

412
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.300
What great love that he would take

413
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.400
an enemy willingly self-sacrifice for

414
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.300
somebody who doesn't deserve it who doesn't have the ability

415
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.000
to pay him back and he says I'm gonna bring you

416
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.300
in.

417
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:43.600
That's love.

418
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.200
This is what the god-man did.

419
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.300
Took the old man.

420
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.700
Made him a new man.

421
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.400
That's the good news of the Gospel.

422
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:03.600
now

423
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.200
something could easily happen at this point.

424
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.400
I want to warn you about what could happen here as

425
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.400
we go forward. We're not careful because we've

426
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.500
just rejoiced in the gospel. The good news as our

427
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:17.900
treasure.

428
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.600
We've seen the Eternal hope that we have in him.

429
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.500
But as we move into what Titus 3 says are

430
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.700
response should be to that good news.

431
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.800
It's easy to kind of leave that behind and suddenly think

432
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.000
that the rest is up to you.

433
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.300
That Jesus Paid the down payment, but now

434
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.600
you're on the installment plan.

435
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.700
You have to somehow keep it or earn it again or something

436
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.900
along those lines.

437
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:51.600
No.

438
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.800
It's so simple to get there.

439
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.100
But don't downshift into some mutated

440
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.200
form of earning your salvation with just

441
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.100
a little Jesus dust sprinkled on top of it.

442
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.300
Because that's where it's so simple. That's what I live for decades.

443
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.100
Salvation don't forget is still.

444
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.600
By grace alone. It's not by works.

445
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.500
It's by grace alone. And I

446
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.600
say it so strongly because of what verse 8 says our

447
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.100
response should be to this good news.

448
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.200
This great love of God. Our response should be

449
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.900
to devote ourselves to Good Works.

450
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.300
That's what verse 8 says our response should be

451
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.400
to devote ourselves to Good Works.

452
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.400
Now we saw in chapter one false teachers were unfit for good works

453
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.200
because they didn't believe.

454
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.500
We should be zealous for good works Titus

455
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.900
2:14 said we should be ready for we should be excited to

456
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.700
live a life. That looks like that.

457
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.800
And I think this passage gives us three reasons why this is so important.

458
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.500
First because it it marks your

459
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.000
new life.

460
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.700
This is what it means to be a Christian to

461
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.300
be new. It marks off. Your new life

462
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.100
is a life full of good works.

463
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.700
because remember Ephesians 2

464
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.200
You were dead in your sins, but he

465
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.200
is now made you alive and not only made you

466
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.200
alive. He's made you a part of the family. Now, you're an heir

467
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.100
of eternal life. And so now you're called to

468
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.700
a new life in light of that.

469
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.400
to live out the family values you might say

470
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.500
what is God's value God's value

471
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.600
is good works.

472
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.800
to live like he does as Ephesians

473
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.000
4

474
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:55.500
says

475
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.200
verses 22 and 20 through 24 says you

476
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.300
are to put off your old self.

477
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.800
Which belongs to your former manner of life is corrupt

478
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.600
through deceitful desires.

479
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.400
And to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and

480
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.000
to put on the new self.

481
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.600
Created after the likeness of God in true righteousness

482
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.000
and holiness.

483
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.000
What he's saying is you're supposed to live a new life.

484
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.300
Right. The old man is gone. The new man has come

485
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.400
in the Salvation crisis offered he's

486
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.200
made you completely new and not only that he's made you a

487
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.400
child of God. And so just like you talk about with people

488
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.300
man. He's a spitting image of his father. He's a she's

489
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.800
a spitting image of her mother, right? What are we saying?

490
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.800
They look just like

491
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.700
Them they look just like the parent. This is what it means to be created

492
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.900
after the likeness like the image of

493
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.900
God means as a child.

494
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.900
You're supposed to be a spitting image of your father.

495
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:02.700
spitting image

496
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.900
look like act like

497
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.700
speak like follow him live out

498
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.400
a life of his values.

499
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.300
Such that people see him through you.

500
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.100
We'll talk a lot more about that later, but it's to put off

501
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.600
the old and to put on the new.

502
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.100
to live a new life

503
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.200
Listen, we're not just talking about showing up every couple Sundays and

504
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.700
and putting Christian on your social media profile.

505
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.600
Yet living the rest of your life as if you're in charge.

506
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.300
Somehow American Christianity has kind

507
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.900
of defaulted down into that.

508
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.300
And that's good enough.

509
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.100
No.

510
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.200
This is this is to fully surrender to the one

511
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.600
who has made you new spiritually.

512
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.300
To give your whole life to him. That's Revival. You want

513
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.600
to Awakening This Is Where It Starts because that's the way God designs you

514
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.300
to be was to be fully surrendered to

515
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.200
him. There's no other way.

516
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.800
So same thing like last week remember who

517
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.700
you are Christian?

518
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.200
Remember who you are who he's made you to

519
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.800
be in this if you've repented and believed in Jesus you are

520
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.400
new.

521
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.000
And the Holy Spirit has been planted inside of you

522
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.000
to rework and re-imagine and make different

523
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.300
your soul so that it looks

524
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.000
like the father.

525
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600
And listen, this is true.

526
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.600
Even if you walked in here feeling beat up.

527
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.300
Even if you walked in here like a failure all week

528
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.100
and you can identify seen after seeing after scene of things that you

529
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.100
blew it in and you don't who didn't didn't follow him

530
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.400
in this way you blew up at your kids you did this at work

531
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.100
or whatever like even if you walked in here feeling like a

532
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:56.900
failure.

533
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.500
Remember who you are Christian?

534
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.400
And remember whose you are.

535
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.100
That if you have now, it's always

536
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.700
good to check right examine your heart but if

537
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.400
you've repented and believed you are his

538
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.300
and you are new.

539
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.800
The old is gone. The new has come.

540
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.500
So just lift that out now.

541
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.400
Because the enemy is going to try to pick and pick and

542
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.200
pick at your assurance.

543
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.000
And some days some weeks gonna be worse than others. It's going to

544
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.100
happen.

545
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.700
But remember what God has done for you.

546
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.600
Remember the gospel because that's how you then live

547
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.500
out the new life. You've been given in Christ.

548
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.700
There's a second reason to be devoted to Good Works.

549
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.900
Not only is it Mark your new life it also magnifies your new king.

550
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.300
It magnifies a life of Good Works magnifies your new

551
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:04.600
king.

552
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.200
Because remember verse 8 has a condition on all of

553
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.700
this the initial step into this it says

554
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.600
so that those who have believed in God may

555
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.900
be careful to devote themselves to Good Works.

556
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.900
Don't get this out of order. Only Believers can

557
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.300
actually do this.

558
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.200
It's a lot of Morality In The World Only Believers can do

559
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.900
good works this word belief though. That's the

560
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.100
condition.

561
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.200
That we're belief is is the same word translated all of the

562
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.600
New Testament as faith and as trust and as belief,

563
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.300
we tend to separate those things out but really

564
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.200
it's all the same idea that it's a confident Assurance

565
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.400
in what is being said

566
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.700
and the who is saying it.

567
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.000
I'm I believe I trust you.

568
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.200
I understand what you're saying and I'm gonna put my life in it. That's all

569
00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.800
belief Faith Trust.

570
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.700
Here's the thing many in our world today.

571
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.200
Have a generic belief that there is a God out

572
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.400
there.

573
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.500
Right students, you ask people at school there would be very few

574
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.200
people who would actually deny and say it now,

575
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.800
there's no God. It's out there. I'm not saying it's not

576
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.100
but most people have a generic belief that there's a

577
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.300
God out there. Even James 2:19 says that

578
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.600
the demons have a monotheistic stance.

579
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.800
Yeah, of course. There's a God.

580
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.100
But the reason they're not saved.

581
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.400
And the reason so many people in our world are not saved.

582
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.200
Is because they do not believe the gospel.

583
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.500
They don't believe Jesus life death and Resurrection was what

584
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.900
it takes to be saved.

585
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.600
And haven't haven't trusted him with their life in that.

586
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.500
Because what happens when you believe that is you

587
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.900
by definition acknowledge him as your king.

588
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.600
Right, it's not just a separated. Like I'm gonna believe facts. It's a I'm

589
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.200
in I'm in.

590
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.700
And so I have said Jesus You're My

591
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:11.700
Lord.

592
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.400
You are the one who is in charge and what happens

593
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.500
then is as that new life happens. He gets

594
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.500
magnified because the only way that you can

595
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.200
run to him. The only way you can run

596
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.500
from self to others. The only way you can run from sin to

597
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.200
Purity in essence is him.

598
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.200
Now you can try you can set some moral boundaries and things like

599
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.700
that, but the only way truly those things can happen.

600
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.200
Is through your king changing you?

601
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.900
So listen, you might have seen today.

602
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.700
I've already said this once but you might have seen today that that your

603
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.300
life looks more like verse 3.

604
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.600
Than it does by being devoted to Good Works.

605
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.400
Like you see the old man defines you not the

606
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:00.900
new man.

607
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.200
Well, here's Jesus response to you.

608
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.700
Repent and believe in the gospel.

609
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.700
It's what Jesus said to do.

610
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.700
Turn from your sin and yourself and turn to

611
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.300
Jesus himself.

612
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.300
Turn to the one who can save you the only

613
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.100
one who can save you.

614
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.800
Like that's what he clearly said. You

615
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.200
might see the old man defines you. Okay? What

616
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.600
do you do you turn to him? Don't just turn to God in

617
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.400
general. Don't just turn to religion.

618
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.300
In fact don't even base this whole

619
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.500
thing on whether you walked an aisle sometime in your

620
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.100
past or whether you prayed a prayer sometime in your past

621
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.100
or whether you may man. I cried a whole lot at camp that one year

622
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:52.200
and that's what it's based on because that can all turn into some emotionalism.

623
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.400
That's not what we're talking about. We're saying to Jesus

624
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.500
You're My Lord. You are the king.

625
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.600
I am all yours.

626
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.300
That's it.

627
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.400
Not how you felt not how you respond. It's about

628
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.500
are you in your heart oriented to Jesus as

629
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.400
your king? I believe you said what? You said Jesus. I

630
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.300
trust you with my life. That's it.

631
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.800
And the moment you do that.

632
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.000
whole life

633
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.500
orients differently God Saves you he

634
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.300
makes you new and here's the third piece. He gives

635
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.000
you a new purpose.

636
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.700
He completely changes everything gives you a new purpose. That's

637
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.100
the third reason for good works. We see here in Titus 3.

638
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.300
It matches your new purpose.

639
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.400
Remember Ephesians 2:10 said that in Christ. You are his

640
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.200
workmanship.

641
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.000
That that word means Masterpiece his unique design

642
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.400
that he or he he did something

643
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.700
uniquely with you that he didn't do with me.

644
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.500
He designed you and then

645
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.200
it says he created in Christ. Hey, I

646
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.200
would say he recreated you in Christ Jesus for good

647
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:07.500
works.

648
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.200
He prepared in advance for you to do to walk

649
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.700
in them.

650
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.500
And so you've got Ephesians 2:10. This is what you're created for.

651
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.500
But then Titus 3:8 ended with these things

652
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.600
are excellent and profitable for people. They're useful.

653
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.600
They're beneficial. These are things that help others. They're

654
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.900
good for you, but they're also good for others

655
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.800
because remember the point

656
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.900
God doesn't need your good works.

657
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.200
But your neighbor does.

658
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.500
God doesn't need anything from you.

659
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.300
That's acts 17. Paul said that to the people

660
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.200
in Athens. They're like you can't provide any food for God. He's

661
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.500
got everything he needs he created everything. He gives you food.

662
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.600
but what he has created you for

663
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.900
is for good works that bless others.

664
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.200
You can't earn standing before God, but he changes you and

665
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.000
he uses you to bless other people.

666
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800
As you humbly surrender as you sacrifice that then

667
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.100
blesses other people.

668
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.500
Okay. So what are we talking about here?

669
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.200
Good works is kind of a generic thought process out there.

670
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.600
So what do we mean? What are the good works we're talking about?

671
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.500
Infinite, but I'm going to give you at least a few look at verses 1

672
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.400
and 2 again first.

673
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.300
Right. This is our general attitude that we should have. How should

674
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.700
we live in life? Look at this now different

675
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.600
this would be than the world.

676
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.400
Remind them.

677
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.800
To be submissive to rulers and authorities.

678
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.900
to be obedient

679
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.300
To be ready for every good work.

680
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.400
To speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to

681
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.200
be gentle.

682
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.900
And to show perfect courtesy toward all people.

683
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.200
You can't tell me that a life like that wouldn't stand out in the

684
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.300
world. We're in right now, right?

685
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.800
I mean just the chaos and vitriol all

686
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.200
over the world and you walk around like

687
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:05.600
that.

688
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.300
It's good work.

689
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.400
But I know we're talking more like okay, what are good works specifically day by

690
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.800
day. Okay, so what we're talking about in that?

691
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.600
Primarily is just following the leadership of

692
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.100
the Holy Spirit.

693
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.400
Because here's what's going to happen.

694
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.300
a distracted believer

695
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.600
will miss what? The holy spirit is prompting to

696
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.400
do in the moment.

697
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.500
But a devoted believer who's looking ready for good

698
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.300
works. We'll see what God wants them

699
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.800
to be involved in right now.

700
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.200
Don't be distracted be devoted and hear me.

701
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.100
Let me give you a couple ideas.

702
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.400
Or a couple examples of what would happen is sometimes we miss these

703
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.400
things. We're just distracted and we miss it. If we're devoted to

704
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.400
looking for these things. We'll see things like

705
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.200
opportunities to call a Widow on her anniversary.

706
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.300
And just you completely miss it, but you see the put on

707
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.400
your calendar. That's what I'm going to do.

708
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.400
Because I'm devoted.

709
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.400
To a good work like that or or to share the gospel with somebody

710
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.700
on the plane you put your buds in just move on like no there's God's put

711
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.600
that person there for a reason or even to

712
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.600
things like hosting students at your house for big

713
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.000
weekend and you completely oblivious to that but you

714
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200
see the good work of that.

715
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.600
if you're looking

716
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.400
to weep with a woman who's been abandoned.

717
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.300
And you're so caught up in your own world that you miss out

718
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.400
on the good work that God has for you just to be with her.

719
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.000
but even more deeply to things like

720
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.300
like not walking in this room focused on self and

721
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.100
what I'm gonna get out of this but realizing that me singing in the

722
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.900
worship Gathering is actually blessing others around me.

723
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.400
Not whether I like it or not, but whether people are being blessed by me.

724
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.400
That's that's a focused Devotion to

725
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.000
good work.

726
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.400
Or even even things like persevering under a trial.

727
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.500
That you just you don't just go with the

728
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.100
Wind of the world. And what's what you're feeling right now, but you

729
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.100
say no Jesus. I'm sticking with you. I'm building my right my house on

730
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.800
the rock. I'm gonna stay steadfast and people see that.

731
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.200
even loving the jerk at work that everybody else

732
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.700
hates and gossips about

733
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.300
Is that not a good work?

734
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.900
Forgiven somebody who stole money from you.

735
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.800
leading times of prayer for repentance and Brokenness at

736
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.000
school

737
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.100
Church home

738
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.900
Good works.

739
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.200
Or think of the good and beneficial work of fostering and adopting.

740
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.300
A Ministry that's growing within our church. I'm so thankful for

741
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.800
that because James 1:27 says religion pure and

742
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.800
undefiled before God. The father is this to visit orphans

743
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.100
and widows in their Affliction and to keep

744
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.400
oneself unstained from the world.

745
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.400
Remember, this is why I'm

746
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.700
talking about this one specifically. Remember how this passage said

747
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.400
we are now heirs.

748
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.300
That we've been brought from enemy into the

749
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.400
family of God, and that's we've been we've been adopted into

750
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.400
God's family.

751
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.300
And so a good work would be to respond to that by just

752
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.400
imitating it here in the world.

753
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.700
And taking an orphan in and saying I am going to love

754
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.400
you and you are my child. What if

755
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.200
dozens of family stepped up here and just said, all right. We're in.

756
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.100
Hey, we're gonna devote ourselves to that good work. We're

757
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.200
in on that. There is already a support system here at the church, which is so

758
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.100
great. And so you can just step up and say all right, let's do it. How do we

759
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:51.400
get there?

760
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:53.900
It's a good work.

761
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.200
Devoted to it.

762
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.200
Or think of the good and beneficial work of

763
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.600
how you use God's money that he's entrusted to you.

764
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.400
He didn't just give that to you. It's by the way. It's his not yours. He didn't

765
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.100
just entrust that to you for your own comfort. And

766
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.400
for your benefit, that's his work through

767
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.100
you is to bless other people now. I know there's a lot of things

768
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:17.700
to give to

769
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.000
All over the world right now. It's fine to give to the things

770
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.700
that you're passionate about.

771
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.900
But one of the most important places to give is through your church

772
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.200
to help support those who teach the

773
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.900
word who disciple your kids who who do counseling and

774
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.400
do help with recovery and things like that. All of

775
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.200
those things are what we're to band together

776
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.400
to see what God can do because here's the

777
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.000
here's the reality.

778
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.300
I know many of you are like I can't give very much. I don't so why

779
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.200
is it's not gonna matter.

780
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.400
Listen, the beautiful part of this as the church is that we pull all

781
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.100
of these resources together to do things that are way

782
00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.100
bigger than you can do by yourself.

783
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.200
Let me just think about that like so a middle school student like

784
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.600
I got ten bucks. Like well, you're ten bucks goes with everybody else's

785
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.300
to do all kinds of things. Just think of the huge

786
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.600
number of ways that you're generosity affects people.

787
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.600
I mentioned a couple you got recovery Ministry lives being transformed. You've

788
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.100
got counseling people getting help in that we've got

789
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.400
people every day walking in the office needing help with bills.

790
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.500
This helps people just very practically.

791
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.400
it takes the gospel to the Nations, we fund missionaries and support

792
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.700
things along those lines church planting replanting like

793
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.600
all of that discipling kids and students

794
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.300
like even this weekend, right this this happens all the faith

795
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.600
happens because you give

796
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.300
You see marriage Ministry?

797
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.500
Parenting like next week in widows singles college students

798
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.200
homebound.

799
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.500
Resources for knowing God's word you see all kinds of

800
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.300
things on and on and again, it's more than just money.

801
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.200
I get that but part of this part of

802
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.500
the point of this.

803
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.900
Is that better than anything else in your life?

804
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.300
Your pocketbook your bank account reflects your

805
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:09.900
priorities.

806
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.500
And the things we're talking about here are not for our own Comfort. We're

807
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.100
not doing this so that we can have better bigger nicer stuff.

808
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.600
We're doing this for the kingdom of God for Ministry purposes. And

809
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.000
there's so much more we can do.

810
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.300
Let me think of planting the gospel in places that have never heard it

811
00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.300
before or places that are hard to get to or to love

812
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.400
people in our city that very few people are even loving right now. We can

813
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.600
have a chance to get into their lives and care for them like Jesus did

814
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.800
for us. So Step Up

815
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.100
This is worship. This is not giving to pay bills.

816
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.500
This is responsive worship to

817
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.800
the Lord as you give financially.

818
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.500
Don't forget this that your new

819
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:55.700
purpose.

820
00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.100
my new purpose

821
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.400
is to respond to the great grace of God in

822
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.300
Jesus Christ by devoting ourselves to

823
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:05.900
Good Works.

824
00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.500
That our lives look different that

825
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.300
each of us live out a unique design God

826
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.800
who has just who's sovereignly creative

827
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.600
and he's put it all together and he makes the body fit together

828
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.500
in such a way that all of us complement each other and we

829
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.300
see God do crazy cool things through all of us

830
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.400
playing our part. That's all by his

831
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.100
grace and mercy

832
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.900
For the purpose of blessing others around us.

833
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.800
See, here's the here's the reality.

834
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.500
God could bless and serve and provide for

835
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.200
people in all kinds of other ways.

836
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.300
God could get the gospel.

837
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.400
To people in all kinds of different ways.

838
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.700
But he's chosen to use you and me.

839
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.000
pretty inefficient

840
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.100
We blow it all the time. We mess it up. We don't

841
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:02.900
do it all the time.

842
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.000
I would pick a different way.

843
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.700
But he's chosen to use you and me Christian.

844
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.100
He's chosen to use the church.

845
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.300
And what he does in that is that more than anything

846
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.500
else shows him off.

847
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.200
Because he uses us.

848
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:22.700
And it works.

849
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.700
He does it he does it through US

850
00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.700
somehow and it shows him off.

851
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.300
That's what Matthew 5:16. Jesus said let

852
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.100
your light shine before others so that they

853
00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.400
may see your good works and give glory to your father

854
00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.500
who is in heaven.

855
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.600
The fact that we're doing these things points to

856
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.500
him, that's the goal to glorify him in everything

857
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.300
in our lives. And since we can't do it without him.

858
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.200
That's why we need to surrender to him for it.

859
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.200
We can't think because we have a lot of money a lot of people

860
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.800
that we can do this we can make it happen. No, we desperately

861
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.700
need him.

862
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.100
Part for me. You can do nothing John 15 says and so

863
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.200
we must surrender we must open our hands we must be

864
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.400
broken before him to respond to his

865
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.200
great grace with a transformed life.

866
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:18.500
to say

867
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.900
with the hymn writer of old.

868
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.200
Nothing in my hand. I bring

869
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.200
simply to thy cross I cling.

870
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.300
That's where our power comes from church.

871
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.900
So let's cling to him for it.
