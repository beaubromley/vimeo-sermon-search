00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Who is the god like

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.100
Yahweh the god of

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.200
wrath the god of Mercy The God

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.500
Who reaches down to unworthy people.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.100
What a powerful testimony, right? Oh, thank

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100
you for being vulnerable Kristen. I want

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.600
to pray for you now.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.300
And invite you to pray with me for her as well

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
God. Thank you for her.

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200
her heart for Kristen's willingness to

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.700
allow you to work in her life and

12
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.400
For your exposure of what was going on in her soul

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.400
that there was something that she was pursuing that

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.500
was not of you.

15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600
And so I pray you'd open our eyes to see it ourselves as

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.900
we need to.

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.000
Keep working in her her husband her family.

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.400
Thank you God for the work of this ministry.

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
May it continue to reach more even today.

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
In Jesus name amen.

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.400
Some grateful for the testimony also grateful for Aaron preaching

22
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.100
Psalm 51 last week while I was holding babies back there

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.800
in the nursery. It was it was fun, but I was

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.300
profoundly struck as Aaron said last week about

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300
This idea how we often slip into saying, excuse me to

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.100
God rather than asking him to forgive us. That was just

27
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.400
so deeply searching of our hearts in that. So

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.200
if you haven't seen that go check it online on our

29
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.100
website from last week. But today we're picking back up

30
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
in our series through the Book of Micah in the

31
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.500
Old Testament just a few weeks left as we get into chapter 6

32
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.900
now.

33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.700
There's only seven chapters. And so we're going to get to chapter 6

34
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.500
turn there with me if you're not already.

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
Micah 6

36
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.100
As we get into it today though, many of you know that one of the things

37
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.700
that I do with each one of our sons is take them

38
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.200
on what we have very creatively entitled 10

39
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.100
trip with that. So when they

40
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.500
hit their 10th birthday some around there I take each of them individually on

41
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.400
a big fun trip just there's no pressure on

42
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.900
it. It's just helping make memories and then help them

43
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.200
teach how to you know, like airports and

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.300
maps and all those things just to navigate the

45
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.500
city and stuff like that. Just really A Memory Maker

46
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.000
for example with my oldest and 2018. We

47
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.600
went to Atlanta and we did everything in Atlanta that

48
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.300
you can do we hit in four days Civil Rights

49
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.800
Museum Martin Luther King stuff, Coca Cola Museum aquarium,

50
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.200
the original Chick-fil-A, which kind

51
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.000
of felt like a pilgrimage of some sort. I don't know if you all need to do that, but that

52
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.300
was what we did there last year with

53
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
our middle son. He and I went all over Pennsylvania. We had

54
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.700
a great time in Philly cheesesteaks Pittsburgh, Hershey

55
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.200
Park Amish farm, the whole deal did all

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.300
of that.

57
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.600
And so our youngest son is going to turn 10 next

58
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.300
summer. And so he's been watching these for years just like

59
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.000
anticipating and waiting and planning and all of that.

60
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.000
But here's the thing about those trips.

61
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.200
Now it's not about what we do on those

62
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.600
trips.

63
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.200
Now the things we do are fun and unique and we try to

64
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.300
make it a big deal memory. Yes, but but as you're kind

65
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.200
of thinking through that with your family, you don't have to go big.

66
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.400
Just be intentional with what you're doing with your kids or with

67
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.000
your spouse.

68
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.800
Because what those boys want.

69
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.300
More than anything about a trip like that. What they

70
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.100
want is me.

71
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
They want time focused time with me as a

72
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.400
dad with his sons regardless of

73
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.800
what we're doing.

74
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.800
It's not about what they get to do.

75
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.200
It's who they get to do it with.

76
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.400
And listen, it's similar with God.

77
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.200
And it's not just I know you're thinking it's not just that we should

78
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.400
want God more than we want his gifts. Yes, that's true. But

79
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.700
But Micah 6 is going to show us that it's you.

80
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.000
Not something from you that God wants.

81
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.800
It's you.

82
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.300
not something that God wants

83
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.900
more than our religious rituals.

84
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.600
More than money or decorations in

85
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.100
our house.

86
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.600
More than our songs. God wants you your your

87
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.800
heart your life your desires Your

88
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.900
Love he wants you.

89
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.400
We'll see how Micah 6 shows that to us. Look at verses

90
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.100
1 through 8.

91
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.900
hear what the Lord says

92
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.100
talking to his people Judah here what the Lord says arise

93
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.900
plead your case before the mountains. Let the

94
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.600
hills hear your voice hear you mountains

95
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.700
the indictment of the Lord and you enduring foundations

96
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.400
of the Earth for the Lord has an indictment against his people

97
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.200
he will contend with Israel.

98
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.700
This is since God's saying oh my people what have I done to you how

99
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.600
have I we read you answer me?

100
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.200
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you

101
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.500
from the house of slavery.

102
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.600
And I sent before you Moses Aryan and Miriam.

103
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.800
Oh my people remember what balak king of Moab devised

104
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.300
and what Balaam the son of bjor answered him.

105
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.400
And what happened from shatim to gilgal that you may know the

106
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.900
righteous acts of the Lord.

107
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.500
And with what shall I come before the Lord and bow

108
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500
myself before God on high?

109
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.200
Shall I come before him with burnt offerings with calves a year

110
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200
old will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams?

111
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.200
With 10,000 of rivers of oil.

112
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.900
Shall I give my first born for my transgression the

113
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.700
fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

114
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.600
And he has told you o man. What is good? What does

115
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.900
the Lord require of you?

116
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.100
But to do justice and to love kindness and

117
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.500
to walk humbly with your God.

118
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.800
Now we need to remember where we've come so far in Micah.

119
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.500
Through the first five chapters. God has been threatening judgment on

120
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.400
his people because of their denial of his Covenant

121
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.400
principles his his Covenant relationship and

122
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.700
in both the leaders of the people and the people themselves

123
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.200
were turning their backs on God.

124
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.900
They were living unjust lives. They were oppressing the

125
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.700
poor. They were believing falsehoods about

126
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.300
God. They were worshiping other gods or worshiping

127
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.800
idols.

128
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.600
Now we know from Micah 5 that God was going to deliver his

129
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.300
people bring a deliverer through Bethlehem, and

130
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.200
and that was going to bring about in reinstation of

131
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.800
this kingdom of God. That would come on the Mountain Zion again someday.

132
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.000
But what we see is that God said to get there.

133
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.200
They're going to have to suffer.

134
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.100
They're going to have to be purified.

135
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.200
To be able to be on that mountain.

136
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.100
And so to expose the issues as he

137
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.000
goes back to his people that there were still relational Covenant

138
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.300
issues with them between them and the Lord.

139
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.400
To expose that the Lord brings a case against his people

140
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.500
here.

141
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.200
It might even say it on the heading that was added later

142
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200
not original in the text of scripture, but they brought an

143
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.700
indictment. They brought a case against his people a legal

144
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.200
case because you look all over this passage. You see courtroom language,

145
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.500
right?

146
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.700
In verse 1 this arise suggests a

147
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.900
lawyer standing up to make his case.

148
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.400
You see this plead your case in verse 1. There's the

149
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.800
word indictment repeated in verse 2 even contend in

150
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.400
verse 2 is like this debate back and forth in

151
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.900
a courtroom setting.

152
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.200
Verse three God calls them out and says answer me.

153
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.400
So there's this this idea of a courtroom setting and

154
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.700
it's happening in this moment.

155
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.400
Which really is just been the whole book of Micah. Hasn't

156
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.500
it?

157
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.200
Where God has consistently through

158
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.400
Micah said to his people you're wrong here, you're sinning

159
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.300
here. You're wrong. Here's bringing a case before them even

160
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.400
to the point where God calls on the mountains and The Valleys

161
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.700
here.

162
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.700
as Witnesses

163
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.600
basically saying creation has watched you Judah.

164
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.900
You have no excuse. You can't stand this is what you've

165
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.300
been doing. They've seen it.

166
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.300
Okay, but what was the specific case? He's bringing here.

167
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.300
That's where we need to see a little deeper. What was

168
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.900
this case that God brought?

169
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.900
The first part of the indictment was where God says, they'd

170
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.900
forgotten his grace.

171
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.400
God says to them you have forgotten.

172
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.000
my grace

173
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.600
verse 3 said the people been complaining.

174
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.400
They were accusing God of being unfaithful.

175
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.400
And so God reminded them of a few things look again at Verses

176
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.000
4 and 5.

177
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.200
Says I brought you up from the land of Egypt redeemed you from

178
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.800
the house of slavery. I sit before you Moses. Aaron Miriam.

179
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.500
My people remember what balak king of Moab devised

180
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.300
what Balan the son of Biore answered him and what

181
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.500
happened from shatim to go gal that you may know the righteous acts of

182
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.300
the Lord.

183
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.300
He says remember what I've done now, there's a couple things

184
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.700
happening here first this this Redemption of

185
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.600
Israel out of slavery that's called The Exodus. It's

186
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.800
entire book of the Bible. It is the main thread

187
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.700
of the Old Testament.

188
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.500
It's why the old the Passover existed was

189
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.800
from that scene?

190
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.600
It's what they were charged to pass on to their children. Don't forget

191
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.300
this. Don't forget this. It's all over the Old Testament.

192
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.700
So we know that would be something God says. Hey remember I

193
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.100
did this.

194
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.900
But these other scenes in verse 5 either go look up.

195
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.500
Because like what did they have to do compared to the Exodus like

196
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.500
this seems a lot less important. I don't even know the names like

197
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.700
right. So so what is God talking about here?

198
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.600
He's actually talking about their entrance into the Promised Land.

199
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.200
The Exodus is there they're leaving at Egypt these

200
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.900
others are where they're now going into God's

201
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.300
Promise Land which happened in a very similar way

202
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.600
they left through the Red Sea is it split and then

203
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.100
they're going into the promised land the Jordan River split and

204
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.300
it's so it's it's like the entrance the exit and the entrance here.

205
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.800
And there's two scenes here first. He mentions this fun story from

206
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.500
Numbers 22 through 24 where there's this block

207
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.900
who is an enemy King from Moab.

208
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.600
He hired this Prophet famous Prophet named Balaam.

209
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.800
He says I want you to curse Israel.

210
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.600
Well God intervened.

211
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.800
And he turned that curse actually into a blessing

212
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.000
of his people.

213
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800
And I say it's fun because it even involves a talking donkey like

214
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.200
from Shrek, right? That's it's a really good story. Go

215
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.400
read it later.

216
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.200
But then he says these two towns should team and gilgal. Why does

217
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.000
he say these towns? What do they have to do with anything?

218
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.500
Well shettim was where balak lived that

219
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.200
was that king of Moab. That's where he lived and it was the last stop on

220
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.400
the Eastern side of the Jordan River

221
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.500
before they would have crossed into the promised land

222
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.000
and then gilgal was the first stop on the

223
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.900
other side of the river once they're in the land.

224
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.300
And so don't think of them as like rest stops on the interstate

225
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.300
where they just happened to walk through those towns. There's a lot going on here

226
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.500
because she team was the place where actually a

227
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.100
lot of Israelites succumbed to moabite idolatry.

228
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.700
Like they're on the border of the promised land

229
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.100
and they still said no we want to follow these other gods.

230
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.300
And so when God says here, hey remember I took you

231
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.100
out of Egypt and I brought you in from shateim to

232
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.000
gilgal remember.

233
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.500
I'm declaring to you my faithfulness that

234
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.900
in spite of your idolatry.

235
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.300
I brought you into the promise.

236
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.400
Now we know not all of them made it.

237
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.800
But in spite of that he says both should

238
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.600
team and gilgal. He says I did it.

239
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.900
I opened the river to bring you in.

240
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.200
That's why God was reminding them of all of this because the

241
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.600
end of verse 5 remember it says that you may know the righteous

242
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.700
acts of the Lord.

243
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.300
He's talking about God saving work in their

244
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.400
life that he delivered his people out of Egypt. He provided

245
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.400
leaders for them through the Wilderness. He saved them

246
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.700
from these evil Kings.

247
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.200
And then he brought them mercifully into the

248
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.900
Promised Land.

249
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.900
And the whole point of that?

250
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.500
all that

251
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.500
was to change them.

252
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.400
Was to bring them into make them into

253
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.300
this chosen set apart nation that

254
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.500
he had originally intended them to be that Israel was

255
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.500
supposed to be distinct.

256
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.400
And he did all of this to show them

257
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:02.700
that.

258
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.400
But they'd forgotten.

259
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.600
They'd forgotten God they'd forgotten

260
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.200
his grace.

261
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.400
They'd forgotten what he had done for them

262
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.300
and instead of remembering and just being so thankful.

263
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.400
They started complaining.

264
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.100
And they started growing tired of God.

265
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.500
Could God bring the same case against us?

266
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:34.900
against you

267
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.200
we are so similar to them, right?

268
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.700
This this quote I read this week. Listen the mercies

269
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.900
of a lifetime.

270
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.100
Are often ignored by us under the

271
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.900
bitterness of a single trial?

272
00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.000
We say that again the mercies of a lifetime are often ignored

273
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.700
by us under the bitterness of a single trial.

274
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.000
May we never forget what God has done Church.

275
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.300
He's been so good to us in countless ways.

276
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.300
And I know in the moment. Sometimes it's hard to remember some of those things. You might

277
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.200
be like, what am I looking for? I can't remember anything that God's been good

278
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.100
to me. Don't forget all that. He's done to save you.

279
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.300
I mean God himself.

280
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.400
Lived died and resurrected to deliver your

281
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:31.900
soul.

282
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.600
If you believe that if you are his then that is something you

283
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.400
can hold on to that's good news.

284
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.500
And you can remember that that's why we sing The Gospel. That's why

285
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.500
we preach the gospel. That's why we memorize God's word.

286
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.400
That's why we speak the gospel to one another in groups. That's

287
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.400
why we build relationships like that because the more we

288
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400
remember that

289
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.100
the more we're changed.

290
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.500
We can't forget.

291
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.400
What God's Grace has done?

292
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.200
But you notice that wasn't the only indictment that he brought

293
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200
against his people here.

294
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.300
It forgotten his grace. Yes, but apparently they'd also

295
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.000
misunderstood his requirements.

296
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.700
They misunderstood his requirements as his people. What

297
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.700
were they supposed to do?

298
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.100
I'm gonna go back and read verses 6 and 7 again but

299
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.600
notice as I read this he's shifted Micah shifted

300
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.300
to almost saying rhetorically something that

301
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.400
they would be saying as the people he's putting words in their mouth

302
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.000
so to speak.

303
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.600
Verse 6 with what shall I come before the Lord and bow myself

304
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.200
before God on high shall I come before him

305
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.200
with burnt offerings with calves or you're old will the

306
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.800
Lord be pleased with thousands of Rams with 10,000 of

307
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.600
rivers of oil?

308
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.500
Even more absurdly shall I give my firstborn my child

309
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.400
for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of

310
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.600
my soul meaning should I put my child on that altar?

311
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400
God is that what you want?

312
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.300
So basically what Mike is simulating here is

313
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.500
they're trying to defend themselves here in this case.

314
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.300
They're basically saying God have you not seen all the

315
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.500
things that we've brought before you not see what we

316
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.800
give you over and over and over again God. Why do

317
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.200
you find fault in US?

318
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.100
Look at how much we're giving you.

319
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.700
But you can tell these questions have a negative assumption,

320
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:32.900
right?

321
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.600
The answer is probably negative to those that God will

322
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.300
not accept all these sacrifices and these

323
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.100
religious actions as the way to get closer to him.

324
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.300
Even if those sacrifices are like over the

325
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.800
top or as we've heard it in the last few years huge, right,

326
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.400
even if they're huge sacrifices that

327
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.300
you have over the top again, and again even in

328
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.300
that he's not primarily concerned with the size and

329
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.600
the cost of those gifts.

330
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.000
He would not accept their sacrifices. Why because

331
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.900
they're worshiping with the wrong attitudes.

332
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.600
Because it's not in here.

333
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.400
Because they're living for themselves out there.

334
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.400
They're doing everything they want to do they're walking their own Road and

335
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.800
yet in here then they're trying to buy God off.

336
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.700
Can we not get to the same place?

337
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.400
Can we not put on an outward display of

338
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.200
religious Behavior to cover up

339
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.100
what we're really about in the rest of our lives?

340
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.500
Listen, if you've been around the church at all for anything like the time, you know, that's my

341
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.300
story for 20 years.

342
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.000
I was the good church kid when everything about the rest of

343
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.700
my life looked completely opposite to that.

344
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.800
That's what they were doing even today.

345
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.400
I can fall into the Trap of thinking

346
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.900
that God will love me more if I just do this

347
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.100
or do that or do that come make it a

348
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.100
deal with God. If I do this, you're gonna do this for me and that's where

349
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.100
we slip into right? It's what they were facing.

350
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.700
That's why we must must remember the fundamental point

351
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.200
today.

352
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.300
That it's your whole life not something from

353
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.300
you that God wants.

354
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.400
He wants you your whole life everything about

355
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.100
you. Not just stuff. Not just something not just

356
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.400
your money. He wants you.

357
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.600
You can do all kinds of stuff. That seems Christian.

358
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.700
But if your heart is far from him, it's all

359
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.200
worthless.

360
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:52.900
He wants you.

361
00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.800
Which all of that?

362
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.200
Sets up our study here of verse 8.

363
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.100
Because you heard them ask the question in verses 6 and 7.

364
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.100
How can we please God?

365
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.500
You saw that question. What's he going to accept?

366
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.300
Who can Ascend his Hill certainly? Something's got

367
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.300
to get us there, right? How can we get to him? Who who can

368
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.800
please God in any way?

369
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.900
But thankfully God gave them the answer.

370
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.200
Here in verse 8. He boils it down.

371
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.200
He distills out the three basic requirements of what

372
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.800
it means to be his people.

373
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.300
looking at verse 8

374
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.300
He has told you o man. What is good meaning? This isn't the

375
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.300
first time they've heard this stuff.

376
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.300
He's already told you. What is good. What does the Lord require of

377
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.300
you but to do justice and to love

378
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.200
kindness and to walk humbly with your God.

379
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.500
So if God says these are the three most important things to

380
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.300
them at this time in history, like we need to understand those things,

381
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:03.600
right?

382
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.400
Especially since as you're reading and you're translation, maybe it says different things. We

383
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.900
need to understand what God is actually saying here.

384
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.300
There's some clarity on these things. And so the

385
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.700
first one I would translate like this act justly.

386
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.700
What does god require?

387
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.300
That we would act justly the word. It's in mind

388
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.300
says do justice.

389
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.400
Act justly live justly because remember remember

390
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.000
the word for for justice in Micah. It

391
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.200
means this right social relationships

392
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.300
based on God's view of what's right. And

393
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:41.900
what's appropriate

394
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.400
so they're living it out. As God would say they

395
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.100
should live it out.

396
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.400
That in light of his Covenant people would mutually respect one

397
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.300
another and they would they would protect those who

398
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.400
are the most vulnerable.

399
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.000
We always talk about the Proverbs 31 Woman. This is

400
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.100
the proverbs 31 man verses 8 and 9

401
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.200
says open your mouth for the mute for the rights of

402
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.800
all who are destitute open your mouth judge righteously

403
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.200
defend the rights of the poor and needy.

404
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.600
That's Justice. According to God's word.

405
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.400
Because remember it in Micah both the

406
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.400
leaders and the people had been stealing land and

407
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.600
oppressing the poor.

408
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.600
And so he's turning around and reminding them of this just standard

409
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.300
that God says no we are to defend the rights of those people.

410
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.500
We are to protect them we are to act justly.

411
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.500
Because that's how God says we should act towards one another.

412
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.500
It works similarly for us today that since God is

413
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.500
just that's part of his nature. We ought

414
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.600
to reflect that image to the world around us.

415
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.800
So when we say act justly that doesn't mean you get to bring your own Justice with

416
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.600
you and firing away at everything or it

417
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.900
doesn't mean you get to judge others because you are doing Justice

418
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.500
or acting justly. It means that you should be

419
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.800
I should be the fairest and most Equitable

420
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.000
person on the face of the Earth.

421
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.600
That we respect the Dignity of every person who also Bears

422
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.000
the image of God.

423
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:20.900
Which is all of us.

424
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.600
That's what Justice means. It's right social relationships

425
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.100
based on what God says is right.

426
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.900
And that doesn't just mean on the outside.

427
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.100
That means even on the inside in our hearts that we

428
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.100
are longing for the justice that God brings.

429
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.500
That one day listen one day will come in full form when

430
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.300
the Messiah returns.

431
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.000
But we can live out those Kingdom principles even now.

432
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.100
We long for that.

433
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.500
We act justly towards seeing that Justice come.

434
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.400
So act justly second. He says we ought

435
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.800
to love faithfulness.

436
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.900
love faithfulness

437
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.100
Yours might say love Mercy or love kindness. Why'd I

438
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.100
say faithfulness? Well, this is because the word for that

439
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.200
Mercy kindness faithfulness is the

440
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.300
Hebrew word. I've said it before with the little get the

441
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.800
throat into it right I said,

442
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.300
That's the word that means so much more than we can Define.

443
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.000
It's the most commonly used word for the character of God.

444
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.600
That it means steadfast Covenant loyalty and love

445
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.500
and faithfulness. It just means all this stuff all put

446
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:37.600
together.

447
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.300
these faithful

448
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.300
and so we are called to love faithfulness.

449
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.300
to love that has said

450
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.100
so that means then if we're to love that means to be

451
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.000
an active participant in it reflecting.

452
00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.000
That commitment.

453
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.000
Both to God and to others in light of his commitment to us.

454
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.100
If we have been called into his Covenant relationship vertically, we're

455
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.500
called to give that to others to be committed to

456
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.300
him. Yes, but then committed to others. It's

457
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.300
what first John 4:19 says.

458
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.000
we love

459
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.500
because he first loved us.

460
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.300
He faithful to us and so

461
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.200
we're faithful to others.

462
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.400
To love that faithfulness and

463
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.100
so think about that.

464
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.500
Yes, of course vertically with God, but think about it in light

465
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.800
of God's faithfulness to you.

466
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.300
Are you?

467
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.600
Dedicated to God's people as well.

468
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.300
If this is what God says to love this kind

469
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.200
of cassette faithfulness, then yes be committed

470
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.700
to him. But he also says that's the way it should play out in life.

471
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.500
So are you dedicated to God's people?

472
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.900
Do you love faithfulness?

473
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.800
By just being with others attending worship Gatherings

474
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.800
making sure you're part of a group with people.

475
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.300
Looking for ways to reimagine your generosity to

476
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.300
them looking for ways to serve other believers in

477
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.900
the church. How how are you committed to serving and

478
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.300
and being in this test said

479
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:17.700
relationship?

480
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.400
horizontally

481
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.300
or are you merely a consumer doing what

482
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.000
is convenient?

483
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.300
That's because this this faithfulness from

484
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.400
God to us is the example.

485
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.000
It's not just convenience.

486
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.400
It's above and beyond.

487
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.500
That's the way we are to be for one another.

488
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.000
Lovingly committed like he is towards

489
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.400
us.

490
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.300
There's one more category here in verse 8. Probably the

491
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.800
most important one. So it's the one we're going to spend the most time on.

492
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.200
It's this phrase walk humbly with your

493
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.600
God.

494
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.400
walk humbly with your God

495
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.800
There's no translation differences here. That's what it means walk humbly

496
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.200
with your God, but what we often do with this one.

497
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.700
Is we narrow that down to just simple humility?

498
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.600
And we say welcome to the God. So be humble put away Pride put

499
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.400
away air against and just be humble now hear

500
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.200
me. I'm agreeing with you. That's true.

501
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.900
But there's so much more to this phrase than just be humble.

502
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.500
When we dig down into the depths of this the

503
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.400
essence of this one is humility true humility

504
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.400
before God.

505
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.700
That we have humbly submitted

506
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.200
this walk which by the

507
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.400
way the word walk is used all over scripture to illustrate the

508
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.300
way you live your life.

509
00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.900
That's what we talk about your walk with Christ.

510
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.300
It doesn't mean you're like literally walking next to him. It means you're living your

511
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.300
life with him in light of him. We'll get

512
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.500
to that here in a second, but that we have humbly submitted our

513
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.000
law.

514
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.900
To him as our King and we're willing to follow him wherever he leads.

515
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.800
Remember when the angel came to Mary? This is

516
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.100
Luke 1:38, the angel came to marry and said

517
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.200
you were going to Bear Jesus you're gonna have this baby miraculously named

518
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.600
Jesus Savior the world. What did

519
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:28.900
she say?

520
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.600
She said let it be to me according to your word.

521
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.600
She's like, I don't understand this.

522
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.100
This is gonna get hard. People are gonna

523
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.300
look at me funny all of these things, but she says Okay

524
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:42.700
God.

525
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.200
your word

526
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.700
Because just think about this phrase again walk humbly

527
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.700
with your God.

528
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.400
This is a relationship. So in that relationship.

529
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.200
Should you be the one leading that walk?

530
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.200
No.

531
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.300
Come on, Jesus. Let's go right like no, that's not

532
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.300
how this thing should work the image. Here's the image. I got in my head this week.

533
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:10.900
It's like

534
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.100
so imagine Jesus walking down a pathway

535
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.300
and then I'm his child and

536
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.300
I'm just crouching like right back here right

537
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.700
behind him just settled behind him, but just

538
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.500
clinging to his arm.

539
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.200
And this I couldn't get this picture out of my head of just like

540
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.200
walking with him and just well almost like when you're

541
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.200
got your grandkids coming over and they just wrap their arm around

542
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.300
your leg and just sit on your foot and you gotta kinda like drag them along

543
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.600
despite kids Despicable Me when the girl wraps on

544
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.900
the cruise leg that kind of thing, right? That's what I'm talking about. It's

545
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.300
that image of of just grabbing his arm

546
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.400
and just following

547
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.500
just walking humbly.

548
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.200
with your God

549
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.600
because in that what you've said is I've submitted to

550
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.900
jesus' Direction.

551
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.300
Like I want to follow him wherever he

552
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.600
goes. I don't care where you're going Jesus. I just want to be with you. I'm just

553
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.100
gonna follow you're going this way. I'm going this way and I'm gonna love what you

554
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.600
love. I'm gonna see what you see. I'm humbly walking with my

555
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.000
God.

556
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.100
But again, that's the point here.

557
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.900
The question was how do we please God?

558
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.600
It's clearly as we've seen not through rituals

559
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.100
and sacrifices.

560
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.200
In an effort to buy him off or to cover up

561
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.300
my sin and if I've sinned again, I better do more of

562
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.300
these things. I better do more quiet times better give more money. I better

563
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.500
go to church and all of that is not how we're

564
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.200
pleasing God what he wants

565
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200
is you

566
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.300
He wants your heart. He wants your love. He

567
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.000
wants your life. He wants you.

568
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.100
Not something not stuff. He wants you.

569
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.500
remember last week in Psalm 51

570
00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.300
It's what David wrote.

571
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.100
As he was confronted with his sin David wrote this Psalm 51

572
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.200
verses 16 and 17 to God.

573
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.100
You will not Delight in sacrifice, or I would give it.

574
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.400
You will not be pleased with a burnt offering here's what

575
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.300
you'll be pleased by he says the sacrifices of God

576
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.100
are a broken spirit.

577
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.400
A broken and contrite heart o God, you

578
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.100
will not despise.

579
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.600
You have to get there in order to say to

580
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.300
Jesus. I'm going with you.

581
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.500
Wherever you go. My heart is broken. My

582
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.300
spirit is broken blessed are the poor

583
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.700
in spirit Matthew 5:3 for they they saw sons

584
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.500
of God like I'm right here with you.

585
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.300
Because here's what happens the more you walk with

586
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.100
God like that the more you walk with Jesus like I

587
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.600
described you clinging to him the more you walk like

588
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.600
that the more you begin to reflect his

589
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.900
image and character to the world.

590
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.300
That's how this thing works.

591
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.200
Because think about it, you're going to go where he goes. You're gonna love

592
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.500
what he loves you're gonna see what he sees. You will begin

593
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.300
to love faithfulness more readily you'll begin

594
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.200
to act justly more regularly. These things will

595
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.600
come up because you're just following along with Jesus as the perfect

596
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.100
example of all of those things.

597
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.300
He's going to do it through you. You're gonna watch him.

598
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.800
You're gonna learn how he does it and you're going to do it alongside him.

599
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.700
The humble submission to letting the Lord direct Our

600
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.500
Lives is where everything else begins to flow

601
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:37.800
from.

602
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.100
you just follow him and he

603
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.500
Does all of it through you?

604
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.500
And so as good as that sounds though.

605
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.000
I mean we're sitting here thinking yes, of course right now. I'm even

606
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.200
sitting here. Yeah, great.

607
00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.700
But here's where the rub comes on this.

608
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.200
You and I so often.

609
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.700
instead of

610
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.000
humbly submitting and Walking with God

611
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.500
you and I choose to stand in opposition to God.

612
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.000
And we stand in opposition to Jesus instead of pulling alongside

613
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.300
him and grabbing his arm. We stand in opposition to

614
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.300
him debating his direction for our lives pushing back

615
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.800
on his commands for our lives wanting our

616
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.300
own will instead of his will to

617
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:32.500
be done.

618
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.300
It's all over the Book of Micah. That's what Judah was

619
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.700
doing. Right they that we just like they we like

620
00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.900
going our own way.

621
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.700
We enjoy our own path.

622
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.700
We don't want to submit.

623
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.100
But you and I know.

624
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.500
What happens with that we end up exhausted?

625
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.600
We end up hurt.

626
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.000
We end up burdened.

627
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.700
And we bring destruction on our own lives and on

628
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.900
lives of those around us that we love.

629
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.500
So we feel that.

630
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.400
Hear me today.

631
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.000
If that's what you're all right now.

632
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.800
If that's where you're at.

633
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.400
And you feel like you have stood in opposition you feel burned out

634
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.500
and you feel exhausted and you feel heard in

635
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.300
this pain if that's what you're feeling is separation, and you've been

636
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.600
opposed to even separated from if that's what you're feeling

637
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.500
hear me. Jesus is standing there with his

638
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.900
scarred hands wide open wanting you

639
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.300
to come to him and just let him wrap his

640
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.800
arms around you.

641
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.200
Because he knows you hurt. He knows what happens when you

642
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.700
walk away from him. He knows you're not okay.

643
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.700
And he wants to he wants you to release that

644
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.800
pain as he just hugs you and you cry

645
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.300
sobbing into his chest because you're

646
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.200
just releasing the pain that you felt he wants you

647
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.300
to give up control and let him just rap his arms around

648
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:19.600
you.

649
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.500
What a privilege that is, right.

650
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.500
Just think about that. Why do we run away

651
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.600
from that embrace?

652
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.400
What why do we push away from the

653
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.500
joy that we find in

654
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.400
his presence?

655
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.400
Why do we stand in opposition and say Jesus? No, not

656
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.400
your way my way instead of Jesus saying no,

657
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.800
just come here. Just come in here.

658
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.000
And release the weight.

659
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.000
Come to be all her weary and burdened. I'll give you rest.

660
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.500
Why do we push back and force our

661
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.500
way out of his Embrace and say no Jesus? I don't want your way.

662
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.200
And listen, I'm the first to say I know how hard it is

663
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.600
to die to your own will.

664
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.200
To die to your self, but do

665
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.200
not forget something in this humbling process. You are

666
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.900
humbling yourself before the god of your salvation.

667
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.200
The God Who already loves you

668
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.500
You don't have to try to prove yourself to him anymore.

669
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.400
You don't have to put on this facade before other people

670
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.200
that you have it all together. You don't have to do

671
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.300
that anymore. You can just remember that he loves you that he's

672
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.300
lived and died and resurrected for you

673
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.900
and he's wanting you just to run into his arms where

674
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.800
you're done. You're just finished with yourself and

675
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.500
you're willing to walk humbly with your God now.

676
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.600
Not just a God by the way. Did you hear that?

677
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.500
Not just a God. Not just the God Walk humbly

678
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.000
with your God.

679
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.400
That this God of the universe who

680
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.300
is Sovereign and in control also wants to

681
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.200
just hold you Safe in His Arms

682
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.100
wherever you go.

683
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.300
Listen, remember more more than religious Behavior.

684
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.200
More than being a good person.

685
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.300
More than you're giving more than you're singing more

686
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.900
than you're lifting hands and and looking super Christian. He

687
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.300
wants you he wants all of you.

688
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.500
Every corner of your heart he wants you to open it

689
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.000
up and just say I'm Yours.

690
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.400
Because he knows that when he has you when he has all of

691
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.500
you your whole heart when you let him

692
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.300
lead you then all that other stuff will start to

693
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.200
flow out of you naturally.

694
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.500
Everything that he wants of you everything he's requiring

695
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.300
of you. That's where it starts.

696
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.500
So don't see this as a burden Church.

697
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.800
Don't see any of this as a burden.

698
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.100
See this that the god of the universe once this

699
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.000
kind of daily living relationship

700
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.800
with you.

701
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.300
And so how do you cling to Jesus? You can't see him. How do you how do

702
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.200
you do this? How do you get around his arm and and walk with how do

703
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.400
you do that? You do that through his word you soak in

704
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.700
his word reading about him praying back to him having this communication

705
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.600
with him consistently constantly throughout

706
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.300
the day you're meditating on his gospel that

707
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.300
he saved you you're praying and inviting him saying Jesus.

708
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.400
I'm going to school. I'm going to to work. Can you

709
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.700
show me how I'm supposed to do this today?

710
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.900
That's how you cling to him.

711
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.000
You focus on him above everything else. That's what it means

712
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:55.900
to cling to Jesus.

713
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.400
But also listen, unbeliever. I want to talk to you for a second here.

714
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:04.900
I hope you see today.

715
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.800
That this is the God we worship.

716
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.300
He's not merely about getting you

717
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.600
to do certain things or to not do certain things.

718
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.200
He wants to be in relationship with you.

719
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.400
Just like you were designed to be originally and everything else is

720
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.700
going to be futile. Everything else is going to be fallen he wants this living

721
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.700
relationship with you.

722
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.400
And so whether you're a Believer or not today?

723
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.200
The invitation is to run into his

724
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.000
arms your daddy's arms and

725
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.000
just bury your face in his chest.

726
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:49.700
sometimes

727
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:51.600
Lead Me

728
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.200
