1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Hi, I am Phil Sali,

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.620
the pastor of Discipleship at Community here at Henderson Hills.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.140
And tonight we're gonna be talking about the role of the director in community

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.740
group ministry. The sound of a single violin.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.740
It can be good now it can be off awful, but it can also be good.

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.780
But it takes an entire orchestra to appreciate a symphony. Now,

7
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.260
both a single violin and the symphony are good, but,

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.380
but one is good and one is glorious.

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.500
And so the reality of a glorious symphony captures the essence of the role

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.420
of the director, and that is team building. In every area of life,

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.180
the power of teamwork is evident, whether it's in music like a symphony,

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.300
or in sports, or in business, accomplishing a big project.

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.220
And even within the context of spiritual leadership, uh,

14
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.740
building a strong team is essential for accomplishing the purposes of the

15
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.420
organization. And so, as community group directors,

16
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.300
we're called not only to lead,

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.580
but also to equip and build the team that works together harmoniously

18
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.740
to achieve God's mission. So we'll be talking about three important things.

19
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.583
First of all,

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.100
the biblical principles that demonstrate the value of building strong teams.

21
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.353
Number two,

22
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.220
building a team to that fulfills the five purposes of a community group.

23
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.273
And then lastly,

24
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.060
we'll talk about seven competencies of an effective community group director.

25
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.233
So first of all,

26
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.980
let's talk about biblical principles that demonstrate the value of building

27
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.060
strong teams. Principle number one is the wisdom of delegation. Now,

28
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.893
in Exodus 18,

29
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.580
we see a beautiful story about Moses and his father-in-law,

30
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.380
and how teamwork can alleviate the burden of an individual leader.

31
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.780
So, uh, Moses is serving the children of Israel after the Exodus,

32
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.140
and people are coming around him to help them with disputes. And, uh,

33
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.380
he's not done this. And so his leader, uh, his father-in-law,

34
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100
Jethro, says to him, what you're doing is not good.

35
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.780
You're gonna only wear yourself out, and those who wait for you.

36
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.740
And so he shares with him the importance of building teams and the wisdom of

37
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.460
delegating tasks. The number two principle is the strength of working together.

38
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.100
We see in Ecclesiastes four,

39
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.140
nine through 12 about the strength of companionship and the power of

40
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.940
teamwork. It says that there are two better than one, and if one falls,

41
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.820
someone can help 'em up. And if one gets cold, someone can warm him up.

42
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.420
And so building team fosters an environment of support and encouragement

43
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.460
and even accountability. And so as a community group director,

44
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.380
you're gonna prioritize the building and the unity and the comradery

45
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.060
of the leadership team for your community group.

46
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.860
And what will happen is then trust will build,

47
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.500
and then resilience will grow among team members.

48
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.340
And so that when challenges arise, and they all do, uh,

49
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.460
we face them together as a leadership team knowing that we have a strong support

50
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.620
system. Number three, the power of many advisors.

51
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.620
Proverbs 1114 reminds us the importance of seeking wise

52
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.760
Counsel and guidance. It says, where there's no guidance, people fall,

53
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.520
but in the abundance of counselors, there's safety.

54
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.880
So this principle not only applies to the nation of Israel,

55
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.960
but it also applies to teams and organizations that when directors surround

56
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.120
themselves with a team of advisors,

57
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.640
they bring a diverse perspective and godly wisdom from different outlooks.

58
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.320
So a well-rounded and diverse team offers valuable insights,

59
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.640
different approaches to problem solving,

60
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.240
and leading together leads to better decisions and better outcomes.

61
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.120
Then we talk about God's design of spiritual gifts.

62
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.960
This is a beautiful thing that God has done for us.

63
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.840
In Ephesians four says that he gave son to be apostles and prophets and

64
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.080
evangelists and shepherds,

65
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.840
or pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry.

66
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.000
Goes on to say that God gives each of his children as spiritual gifts.

67
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.680
And those gifts are meant to equip the saints for the building up of the body of

68
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.000
Christ until we all attain unity in the faith.

69
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.880
So each member has a unique spiritual gift.

70
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.440
It's like a talent that when combined together creates a powerful force for

71
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.120
accomplishing the five purposes of a community group.

72
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.280
And so as the community group director,

73
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.360
your job is to enlist those with different gifts to serve in different

74
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.473
capacities,

75
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.320
ensuring that all the aspects of the five purposes and mission of the community

76
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.153
group are covered,

77
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.920
and that the team operates together harmoniously and unity and fruitfully.

78
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.320
And then down in verse 16,

79
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.960
it emphasizes the significance of every part doing its work together.

80
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.920
It's an analogy that kind of underscores the interdependency of team members,

81
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.280
the body of crisis described as a physical body,

82
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.800
and it has to work in harmony to function properly. Uh,

83
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.280
number next is the, uh, beauty of spiritual fitness. In one Corinthians 12,

84
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.160
a completely different book than Ephesians,

85
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.400
Paul compares the body of Christ to a physical body and identifies this

86
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.080
beautiful thing when the body of Christ works together,

87
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.200
as each member has a specific, specific gift and a unique function,

88
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.560
and no gift being insignificant. Well,

89
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.360
in the context of building teams for the community group,

90
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.240
this principle emphasizes the importance of embracing a variety of leaders

91
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.200
from different backgrounds and cultures and experiences. And God has unique, uh,

92
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.600
uniquely gifted each member to be a creative and influential part of the team.

93
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.720
The director then celebrates these differences and then creates an environment

94
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.320
where every team member's voice is heard and valued.

95
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.720
Then we are speak about the call to serve. And first, Peter, for one,

96
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.800
reminds us that each gift, each has a gift.

97
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.360
Use it to serve one another as a good steward of God's varied grace.

98
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.200
What that means is, is that directors lead by example,

99
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.800
showing humility and a servant's heart.

100
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.040
And when their team members see their leader, the director serving selflessly,

101
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.960
then they're inspired to do the same.

102
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.920
And so serving together serves to strengthen the bond between members and

103
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.760
unites them for a common purpose. Next,

104
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.160
we're gonna talk about leadership development. Leadership, uh, development is,

105
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.960
is a core value for every healthy organization,

106
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.960
and there's an urgency for developing future leaders.

107
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.400
For those of us that are, uh, in our, the second half of our life in 30 years,

108
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.800
uh, will not be leading effectively if we're even alive. And so,

109
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.200
developing leaders that are younger than us,

110
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.480
developing leaders that can carry the torch is, is the best option.

111
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.920
And what's great about community groups is that we already have an amazing tool

112
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.200
for leadership development. Did you know that if Henderson Hills Baptist Church,

113
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.840
uh, would double its leadership, uh, influence,

114
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.120
then we could triple our effectiveness as ministers of the gospel?

115
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.960
And so, uh, this training tool is already in place week after week.

116
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.120
Our church is actually training future leaders, and, uh,

117
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.440
we're working at becoming intentional about building within our community groups

118
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.640
scores and scores of potential leaders who are discovering their

119
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.240
potential to serve God as apprentices.

120
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.200
So directors create a team that then enlists

121
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.680
apprentices. And in what's what's happening then, is the curriculum for, uh,

122
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.240
leadership development has already been written. Uh,

123
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.080
classroom sites have already been built. The mem uh,

124
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.720
mentors for leadership are standing by and the future leaders will

125
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.640
follow if we give them an opportunity. Uh,

126
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.640
community groups are still one of the very best leadership boot camps for our

127
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.340
church.

128
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.920
And so team building is a huge biblical principle that aligns with

129
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.480
God's design for his people.

130
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.120
It enables directors to fulfill the five purposes of the community group more

131
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.680
effectively and empowers team members to use their God-given gifts

132
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.400
to advance God's kingdom.

133
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.800
And so the director enlists the team and delegates the task

134
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.000
and fosters community support,

135
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.240
and then seeks many advisors and embraces spiritual fitness.

136
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.760
And in doing so, they,

137
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.440
they all serve together with humility so that they can unlock the true power

138
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.160
of teamwork. Uh, this next slide is an example of, uh,

139
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.320
the kind of, uh, leadership we're talking about here.

140
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.400
Here you see the five purposes of a community group, reaching people for Christ,

141
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.160
teaching people the Bible, ministering to one another,

142
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.920
serving the Lord as a community group,

143
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.880
and integrating the mission and vision of the church in the community group.

144
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.920
Well, one person cannot accomplish those five purposes.

145
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.040
So we've matched those five purposes with potential leadership opportunities.

146
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.320
Reaching people for Christ is primarily done by the outreach social leader

147
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:54.760
teaching people. The

148
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.520
Bible of a course is done by the Bible teacher ministering to one another,

149
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.680
then is followed up by another leader called the prayer care leader.

150
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.320
And serving the Lord together, we will talk about it at a different time,

151
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.760
is a done so by the mission's leader. And then lastly,

152
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.800
integrating the mission and vision.

153
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.800
That's your job director as a disciple maker to reduplicate yourself

154
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.800
and the leaders and their apprentices.

155
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.160
So let's lastly talk about the seven competencies of an effective community

156
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:21.993
group director.

157
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.680
There are seven competencies that every community group director can master,

158
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.280
and then in doing so, become a great leader for the team he or she has built.

159
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.133
Number one,

160
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.640
the community group director must know and understand the five purposes of the

161
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.280
community group. We just went over them, uh, reaching people for Christ,

162
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.920
teaching people the Bible, ministering to one another,

163
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.480
serving toge the Lord together as a community group and integrating the work of

164
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.320
the mission and vision of the church and the community group.

165
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.640
So you have to know those and understand them because, uh,

166
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.200
beyond understanding them,

167
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.880
you must effectively learn how to convey these five purposes to your leadership

168
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.280
team. And, uh, number two of these competencies,

169
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.600
the community group director must organize or reorganize the community group

170
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.640
effectively. Uh, the,

171
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.200
the leadership team will result in promoting a healthy and effective,

172
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.840
uh, path towards spiritual and numerical growth.

173
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.880
And not only does the community director need to understand how to organize the

174
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.620
community group,

175
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.280
he also needs to understand how to build and effectively equip each member. And,

176
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.040
uh, I will be coming alongside all of our directors to help you do that.

177
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.840
Number three, uh,

178
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.720
the community group director leads the work of the community group. Uh,

179
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.440
the key areas of the community group director include vision.

180
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.800
The director of the leadership team needs to learn to, uh,

181
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.240
to pray and pray for a strong, healthy,

182
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.920
clearly understood vision and a growing fruitful community group.

183
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.640
And, uh, number four, the community group director,

184
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.200
enlists and equips leaders for the community group. This is, if,

185
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.480
if you forgot all other seven competencies,

186
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.520
this one right here is the number one,

187
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.480
and that is that you equip and enlist leaders. It,

188
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.720
it's your job to understand the leadership needs and then to take the steps in

189
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.840
discovering and enlisting the needed leaders. Um,

190
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.520
you'll need to discuss it during your community group time. You'll, uh,

191
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.200
you'll need to be on the lookout for those who, uh,

192
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.160
may have had experience leading or those who show the potential for leadership.

193
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.000
Uh, you'll need to determine, uh, uh,

194
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.040
the right path for determining this enlistment process.

195
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.800
How do we do this? Uh, do they shadow me for a little while?

196
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.520
When do I give them an opportunity to express their own leadership abilities?

197
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.120
And so, uh, that's the equipping process and, uh, uh, it's,

198
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.960
it's on you. Uh,

199
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.920
one of my favorite community group directors is a little lady named Linda Casey.

200
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.600
And Linda was the director of a, uh,

201
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.040
Community group, uh, of senior adult ladies. And, uh,

202
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.600
most of these ladies had gotten to a point in their lives where they thought,

203
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.433
well, I'm done here.

204
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.240
But when they came into that Linda Casey's community group as the director,

205
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.560
she says, well, you better get ready to serve here.

206
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.080
Nobody just sits in this class. And I'm not kidding you. Everyone had a role.

207
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:15.400
And that class grew and multiplied and grew and multiplied twice in

208
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.000
the three years I was serving as her community group pastor. Number five,

209
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.880
the community group director works well with other community,

210
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.520
community group ministry leaders that would be working well with me,

211
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.800
also working well with our elders and our pastoral staff.

212
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.760
The key working relationships are so very important.

213
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.760
Please don't be that rogue Community Group director that says,

214
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.240
I know what the pastor says, but this is what I say. No.

215
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.920
We work together to fulfill the clear vision and articulate the mission,

216
00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.400
uh, of our church and the work of the community Group.

217
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.800
Number six of seven is the community di group director supports an effective

218
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.920
administrative process. Now, we will have in our leadership team,

219
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.400
those who are committed to the administrative process, uh,

220
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.320
but it's not just their job alone. Ultimately,

221
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.480
it's the community group director's job to make sure that they have implemented,

222
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.440
uh, an effective administrative process, record keeping,

223
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.160
as well as record reporting and an accurate attendance record,

224
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.760
uh, an up toto date enrollment roster, and a, uh,

225
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.400
a adding process and a dropping process.

226
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.760
This administrative process ultimately falls on you as the leader.

227
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.480
And finally, in our seven competencies,

228
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.960
the community group director understands how to work with and encourage leaders.

229
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.360
Everything we do as leaders rises and falls on leadership.

230
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.400
And so learning how to manage relationships with harmony

231
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.240
and unity, uh,

232
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.280
occurs as leaders establish effective communication and trust building.

233
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.560
Uh, a community group leader that is encouraged,

234
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.200
serves with greater joy and courage and longevity.

235
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.240
And so a community group director should hone his or her skills in

236
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.280
encouraging these leaders and doing so frequently and effectively.

237
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.400
A few ways is write short notes or texts or emails, uh,

238
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.960
make public expressions of appreciation. Uh,

239
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.680
every Sunday you have an opportunity to say,

240
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.560
I'm so proud of so-and-so for the job they've done.

241
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.080
This is how they serve us in their role. Uh,

242
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.040
as you celebrate wins and the accomplishments of leaders on your team,

243
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.960
and you also focus on the needs of leaders, if someone needs to take a break,

244
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.960
you step in for them. You encourage them to find an apprentice when they need a,

245
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.520
a, a break. Uh,

246
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.320
you can also write down requests and respond to them specifically and

247
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.320
quickly. Uh,

248
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.040
don't forget that they need you as their leader and they are observing you. And,

249
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.973
uh, and,

250
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.680
and you can determine the needs of your leaders and you can answer those needs

251
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.600
as God gives you insight and wisdom.

252
00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.840
If they're beyond your ability to meet those needs,

253
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.320
then you secure the help of the pastors and, and deacons. And in doing so,

254
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.240
what you're doing is building an effective leadership team. Well,

255
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.760
we conclude by saying this, that, uh,

256
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.880
directors of community groups have the opportunity to influence the future of

257
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.440
our church. They also infu, uh,

258
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.000
have the opportunity to influence the future of the, uh,

259
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.800
future leaders and the kingdom of God. And so, uh,

260
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.920
the future leader is recruited and trained and then develops a

261
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.520
bond with the director. And then that future leader, uh,

262
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.320
learns the passion of the director,

263
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.480
and that passion becomes the future leader's passion.

264
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.000
And the director's attitude becomes the future leader's attitude.

265
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.360
And as the director leads, so then the future leader will lead.

266
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.000
And so a director,

267
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.800
you are primarily responsible for developing leaders for future generations in

268
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.000
our church. And,

269
00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.160
and what better plan is there to launch a leadership development strategy than

270
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.520
in our community groups? I'm confident of this, that God is, uh, uh,

271
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.560
is up to something. He is working within the lives of our future leaders.

272
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.120
And you get to be a part of enlisting and equipping and developing and launching

273
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.880
those future leaders for God's glory.
