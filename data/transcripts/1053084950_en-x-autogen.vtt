1
00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:20.325
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.005
Welcome to Henderson Hills.

3
00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.285
My name is John Lead teaching pastor here.

4
00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:26.525
It's always a joy to gather together like this.

5
00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:29.645
Um, as you can hear, probably most all

6
00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:31.725
of us in this room have been hit over the last couple

7
00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:32.965
weeks with something, right?

8
00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:35.405
Uh, so I am on the back end of it.

9
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.085
So let's just pray that this thing keeps

10
00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:38.525
going the whole time.

11
00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:39.765
We'll see. Uh,

12
00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.365
but we're continuing our series today called He Shall Reign.

13
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.485
It's in one Samuel where we're looking at

14
00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:48.045
what it re really means to have God as our king,

15
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.925
what that truly means.

16
00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:51.645
And as we get into it today, I wanna begin

17
00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:54.405
by telling you about what were the two hardest weeks

18
00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.885
of every year in college for me.

19
00:00:57.465 --> 00:00:59.125
Uh, they're known as training camp

20
00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.885
or two adays often is what it was referred to back then.

21
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:05.805
They don't do that so much anymore, but it's what it was.

22
00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.685
And it was when the football team would come back

23
00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:10.005
after the summer of workouts and we'd gather together

24
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.125
and we'd strap the pads on.

25
00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:14.765
We'd really begin to work at what we were looking forward

26
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:16.325
to for the season.

27
00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:19.485
And every day, somehow it seemed

28
00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:20.685
to be a hundred degrees all day.

29
00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.165
There was zero clouds in the sky.

30
00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:23.685
I don't know how that works out every

31
00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:25.165
August, but that's how it was.

32
00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.525
And we ate, drank, and slept

33
00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.325
football every single day for those couple weeks.

34
00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:32.205
And it was meant to prepare us for the grind

35
00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.645
of the season, right?

36
00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:36.125
But there was a dual purpose to it

37
00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:39.325
because it was also meant to weed out those

38
00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:40.725
who couldn't endure it.

39
00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:47.555
See, it revealed a lot about who a person really is.

40
00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:49.595
When you get into that moment,

41
00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:51.115
are you going to brave through it?

42
00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:53.755
Are you going to stay steadfast?

43
00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.395
Are you going to do the right thing every time,

44
00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:57.515
even when it's hard?

45
00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:01.155
Or were you gonna bail? Were

46
00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.235
you gonna take the easy way out?

47
00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:03.555
Were you gonna look for shortcuts?

48
00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:09.625
But when you think about it, isn't that true

49
00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:13.065
of any difficult moment in our lives?

50
00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:16.835
You don't have to be in a hundred degree heat

51
00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.995
for three hours getting screamed at by a coach

52
00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:20.715
to have this situation revealed.

53
00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:22.995
It's when you get that diagnosis

54
00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:28.785
or when your boss comes down hard on you, or

55
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:31.185
whenever you're tempted again by that same thing,

56
00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:32.385
you just can't seem to get over

57
00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:34.145
or when you're getting shunned

58
00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:36.265
for being a believer at school or

59
00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:39.225
whenever you are facing financial difficulties.

60
00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:40.825
Any of those moments in life.

61
00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:45.965
Have you ever thought that God could be using those

62
00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:49.445
training camps for your good,

63
00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:56.465
to test you, to reveal your faith

64
00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:59.725
to others, but also to you?

65
00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:07.055
God did that for David here in one Samuel 21.

66
00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:09.885
But the question before us today,

67
00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:12.445
before we turn there, the question for us is

68
00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:15.765
how are we gonna respond when we face the

69
00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:17.925
hardships of trading camp?

70
00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:21.875
And we'll look for it today in God's word

71
00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:24.235
as we turn together to one Samuel Chapter

72
00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:27.235
21, 1 Samuel 21.

73
00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.385
If you're not there already, David was on the run

74
00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:33.705
from King Saul.

75
00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:37.745
He, he was a man jealous of God's anointing

76
00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:40.505
and he, God's presence with David.

77
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.385
And now David knew for sure

78
00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:44.865
that Saul was trying to kill him.

79
00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:46.305
And so he's on the run.

80
00:03:48.835 --> 00:03:51.215
And in this chapter we're gonna see three scenes.

81
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:54.015
They all fit together, but they also all set

82
00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:55.175
us up for something later.

83
00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:57.495
It's what the narrator does a great job

84
00:03:57.495 --> 00:03:59.575
of preparing us for something.

85
00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:01.055
But this, this works.

86
00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:04.695
And, and what we'll see here is watching God show more

87
00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:06.655
of himself to us through these scenes

88
00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:07.775
with David in his life.

89
00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.355
I'm gonna read the whole section starting in verse one

90
00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:14.075
of one, Samuel 21.

91
00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:18.855
Then David came to knob to Alek, the priest.

92
00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:21.015
Alek came to him,

93
00:04:21.325 --> 00:04:23.855
meet David Trembling said to him, why are you alone?

94
00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:27.215
No one with you. David said to Alek the priest,

95
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:28.735
the kings charged me with a matter

96
00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:30.935
and said to me, let no one know anything

97
00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:32.575
of the matter about which I send you

98
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:34.055
with which I've charged you.

99
00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:36.415
I've made an appointment with the young men for such

100
00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:40.055
and such a place, meaning my men are waiting for me now then

101
00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:41.135
what do you have on hand?

102
00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:43.335
Gimme five loaves of bread or whatever is here.

103
00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.175
And the priest answered, David,

104
00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:46.415
I have no common bread on hand,

105
00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:47.895
but there's holy bread if the young men

106
00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:48.975
have kept themselves from women.

107
00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:51.135
And David answered the priest, truly,

108
00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:52.575
women have been kept from us as always,

109
00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:55.495
when I go on an expedition, meaning they're, they're clean,

110
00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:58.695
uh, ceremonially, the vessels

111
00:04:58.695 --> 00:04:59.695
of the young men are holy even

112
00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:00.735
when it's an ordinary journey.

113
00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:03.415
How much more today will their vessels be holy?

114
00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:05.815
So the priest gave him the holy bread

115
00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:06.935
for there was no bread there,

116
00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:09.255
but the bread of the presence in the tabernacle,

117
00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:10.495
which is removed from

118
00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:11.535
before the Lord to be replaced

119
00:05:11.535 --> 00:05:13.295
by hot bread on the taken away.

120
00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:17.335
Now, a certain man of the servants of Saul was there

121
00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:19.215
that day, detained before the Lord.

122
00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:24.535
His name was Dogue, the mite, the chief of Saul's herdsman.

123
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:26.055
It's kind of inserted there.

124
00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:29.375
We'll come back to that actually in next Sunday's sermon.

125
00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:34.905
But then David said to Alek, then, have you not here a spear

126
00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:36.025
or a sword at hand?

127
00:05:36.465 --> 00:05:38.505
I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me.

128
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.505
'cause the king's business required haste.

129
00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:43.265
And the priest said, the sword of Goliath,

130
00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:45.585
the Philistine whom you struck down in the valley of Elah.

131
00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:48.305
Behold it's wrapped here in a cloth behind the ifad.

132
00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:50.785
If you'll take that, take it. There's none but that here.

133
00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:54.585
And David said, there's none like it. Give it to me.

134
00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:57.965
And David Rose and fled that day from Saul

135
00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.925
and went to Aish, the king of gaff.

136
00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:02.445
And the servants of Aish said to him,

137
00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:04.365
is this not David the king of the land?

138
00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:06.805
Did they not sing to one another of him? And dances?

139
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.365
Remember this, Saul has struck down his thousands.

140
00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:10.525
David is 10,000.

141
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.125
And David took these words to heart

142
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.365
and was much afraid of Aish the king of God.

143
00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:17.685
So he changed his behavior

144
00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:20.165
before them pretended to be insane in their hands,

145
00:06:20.635 --> 00:06:22.205
made marks on the doors of the gate,

146
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.165
let his spittle run down his beard.

147
00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:27.045
Then Aker said to his servants, behold,

148
00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:28.165
you see this man is mad.

149
00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:31.045
Why have you brought him to me? Do I lack mad men?

150
00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:32.485
You've brought this fellow to behave

151
00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:33.805
as a mad men in my presence,

152
00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:36.205
shall this fellow come into my house?

153
00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:41.725
So David departed from there, escaped to the cave

154
00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:43.685
of a doula when his brothers

155
00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:45.005
and all his father's house heard it.

156
00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:48.085
They went down there to him, everyone who was in distress,

157
00:06:48.365 --> 00:06:49.925
everyone who was in debt, everyone who was bitter in

158
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.765
soul gathered to him.

159
00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:54.085
He became commander over them.

160
00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:55.925
And there were about 400 men with them.

161
00:06:56.965 --> 00:06:59.235
David went from there to MPA of Moab

162
00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:01.675
and he said to the king of Moab, please let my father,

163
00:07:01.695 --> 00:07:04.755
my mother stay with you till I know what God will do for me.

164
00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:07.075
He left them with the king of Moab.

165
00:07:07.075 --> 00:07:08.275
And they stayed with them all the time

166
00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:09.475
that David was in the stronghold.

167
00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:12.455
And then the prophet Gad said to David,

168
00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:14.335
do not remain in the stronghold.

169
00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:16.615
Depart, go into the land of Judah.

170
00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:20.575
So David departed, went into the forest of Herath.

171
00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:26.225
God, we pray as we look at this text that is

172
00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:30.985
scenes of David's life, may it not just be a narrative

173
00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:35.425
to us, but God, we ask you by your spirit

174
00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:37.465
to change our hearts and to change our lives.

175
00:07:39.955 --> 00:07:44.465
Only you can do that. Strengthen us. Sustain us.

176
00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:49.265
Challenge us. Don't let us walk out of here being hearers

177
00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:50.785
and not doers of your word.

178
00:07:51.535 --> 00:07:53.435
In Jesus' name. Amen.

179
00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:57.775
Now, one of the parts I love

180
00:07:57.795 --> 00:07:59.815
of the Bible is that it's so honest.

181
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:03.275
See, it never sugarcoats anything.

182
00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:05.755
It doesn't shy away from telling you both the good

183
00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:07.515
and the bad about someone's life.

184
00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:12.555
See, David is often the hero in our minds, right?

185
00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:14.755
We look at David and Goliath, all the things David did,

186
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:15.795
he's a hero to us.

187
00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:19.275
But here in this scene, he's still in training camp mode.

188
00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:23.505
He's needing to grow more fully into the man

189
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:25.185
after God's own heart that he actually was.

190
00:08:27.145 --> 00:08:30.685
So what did God do? God put David into situations

191
00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:32.805
to test his dependence.

192
00:08:35.285 --> 00:08:38.585
God put David in situations to test his dependence.

193
00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.945
Like those August days when the coach would take someone

194
00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:46.425
farther than they really needed to go, what

195
00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.105
that would do is it would prove to that player

196
00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:50.745
that they could do it, that they could actually make it.

197
00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:55.605
God's doing that in a way here with David.

198
00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:57.485
And watch how David responded.

199
00:08:57.555 --> 00:09:01.045
Well, initially he stretched the truth.

200
00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:05.595
David's response to this training camp was

201
00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:07.315
that he stretched the truth initially.

202
00:09:09.195 --> 00:09:10.815
So remember what happened here? He, he shows up

203
00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:15.805
to this priest and he shared a story about how the king,

204
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.325
we'll get back to that in a second,

205
00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:19.805
sent him on this super secret mission

206
00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:22.415
that he had to come alone.

207
00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:25.015
He had to come in a, in a rush. All of that.

208
00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:31.055
Was that the truth? We don't actually know.

209
00:09:31.055 --> 00:09:34.175
It doesn't seem like it's a full on lie,

210
00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:37.335
because later in Mark two actually

211
00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:38.975
Jesus referenced this scene.

212
00:09:38.975 --> 00:09:40.215
He wasn't critical about it,

213
00:09:41.575 --> 00:09:44.715
but it certainly had some measure of

214
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.715
not fully true, right?

215
00:09:46.715 --> 00:09:50.595
Like he, he, he was maybe trying to protect the priest

216
00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:51.995
that the priest didn't get accused

217
00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:53.435
of being a conspirator with him.

218
00:09:53.435 --> 00:09:54.915
Maybe that's what he was trying to do.

219
00:09:55.015 --> 00:09:56.275
But it, it, whatever it was,

220
00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:58.115
it was certainly a stretch, right?

221
00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:02.825
'cause some people would say, well, he was referring to God

222
00:10:03.045 --> 00:10:05.345
as the king who sent him on this mission, okay?

223
00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:06.705
Even if he was like,

224
00:10:06.765 --> 00:10:09.865
that's still at the very least stretching the truth

225
00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:12.905
a little bit so he could have food and weaponry.

226
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:14.985
That's really what he was after.

227
00:10:17.305 --> 00:10:19.665
Remember the same man who a couple chapters earlier

228
00:10:19.765 --> 00:10:23.185
to Goliath said, no, God doesn't save by sword or spear.

229
00:10:24.405 --> 00:10:27.225
And now he's like, gimme a sword. I need a sword, right?

230
00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:29.465
So he's stretching the truth a little bit

231
00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:30.985
and maybe out of fear,

232
00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:33.505
even in the next scene, we see it as well.

233
00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:35.265
David took off into Philistine country.

234
00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:37.945
He was captured, how'd he get outta that?

235
00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:40.905
Because the, the Philistines remembered David naturally,

236
00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:42.065
they knew he was the king.

237
00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:44.345
They knew the songs. People sang about him.

238
00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:47.615
They knew David was the one. How'd he get out of it?

239
00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:53.295
Remember verse 13 of chapter 21, he changed his behavior

240
00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:55.855
before them and pretended to be insane in their hands

241
00:10:55.915 --> 00:10:57.615
and made marks on the doors of the gate

242
00:10:57.755 --> 00:11:00.575
and let his spit run down his beard.

243
00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:01.655
Like, isn't that crazy?

244
00:11:03.215 --> 00:11:04.815
I couldn't help but think of this guy

245
00:11:05.135 --> 00:11:06.855
whenever I read that verse, right?

246
00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:09.015
Well, sad, right?

247
00:11:09.095 --> 00:11:11.815
I couldn't, I can't yell that right now like he could.

248
00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.975
But, uh, that, that's what I thought

249
00:11:13.975 --> 00:11:16.015
of just this insane figure

250
00:11:16.205 --> 00:11:17.975
that he was trying to portray to them.

251
00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:21.655
But, but remember, David's not crazy, right? He was acting.

252
00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:27.205
So was was he just being resourceful like a good soldier,

253
00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:28.725
getting out of his sticky situation?

254
00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:32.475
Was that what he was doing? At the very least,

255
00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:33.675
he's stretching the truth.

256
00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:41.655
And listen, those things might seem like minor, but,

257
00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:46.095
but they lead actually to very severe consequences later.

258
00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:52.335
They lead to severe consequences

259
00:11:55.355 --> 00:11:59.565
even as quickly as next week in the rest of chapter 22.

260
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.935
What David did when he went to Knob

261
00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.175
and he talked to the priest

262
00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:06.775
and he did all the things that he did, it ended up

263
00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:10.415
where 85 priests get killed at the hands of Saul.

264
00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:18.995
And just as an aside, sin always has consequences.

265
00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:23.645
At the very least, David didn't trust God fully.

266
00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:28.145
And so sin always has consequences.

267
00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:29.905
Whether the pain shows up immediately

268
00:12:29.905 --> 00:12:33.465
or not, sin will always bring about Galatians six says,

269
00:12:33.465 --> 00:12:35.585
you will always reap what you sow

270
00:12:37.275 --> 00:12:38.285
even if it's not immediate.

271
00:12:41.455 --> 00:12:44.635
But here's what we also see in this training camp scene.

272
00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:47.735
We see David's growth.

273
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.785
He grows like just at the, just like at the end

274
00:12:53.785 --> 00:12:57.585
of those weeks in August, we would be more fit, stronger,

275
00:12:58.015 --> 00:13:00.145
more capable to enter into the season.

276
00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:01.225
Like that's the way it works.

277
00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:03.945
You go through training camp, you make it through

278
00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:06.065
and you are stronger on the other side of it,

279
00:13:06.355 --> 00:13:07.785
David was growing

280
00:13:07.845 --> 00:13:09.985
and that's what we see at chapter 22, beginning.

281
00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:14.025
First, the first five verses that David finally came

282
00:13:14.025 --> 00:13:16.145
around to trust the Lord.

283
00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:19.315
He finally did trust the Lord.

284
00:13:19.735 --> 00:13:24.625
In the end, I wanna read verses three

285
00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:26.545
through five again of chapter 22.

286
00:13:26.545 --> 00:13:29.825
Watch this. He'd gone through those scenes.

287
00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:34.065
He'd been exiled now into this cave.

288
00:13:34.165 --> 00:13:37.145
And David went from there to Mspa of Moab.

289
00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.905
He said to the king of Moab, please let my father

290
00:13:39.965 --> 00:13:42.905
and my mother stay with you till I know what

291
00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:45.065
God will do for me.

292
00:13:46.685 --> 00:13:48.105
And he left them with the king of Moab.

293
00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:49.265
They stayed with him all the time.

294
00:13:49.265 --> 00:13:50.425
David was in the stronghold.

295
00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:53.705
And then the prophet Gad said to David,

296
00:13:53.845 --> 00:13:55.145
do not remain in the stronghold.

297
00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:56.625
Depart, go into the land of Judah.

298
00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:59.225
So David departed went into the forest

299
00:13:59.365 --> 00:14:02.445
of hath, right?

300
00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:04.405
So, so did you notice something different here?

301
00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:08.085
For the first time in any of these scenes,

302
00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:13.285
God's name is mentioned, God's involved

303
00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:16.045
in the process of David walking

304
00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.525
out this life, the first two scenes.

305
00:14:18.675 --> 00:14:20.645
What did he trust? His own craftiness,

306
00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:23.085
his own skill, his own wisdom.

307
00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:26.085
He trusted those things the first two times here,

308
00:14:26.255 --> 00:14:31.205
David trusted God, including at the end,

309
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:34.445
by trusting and and trusting God by listening to

310
00:14:34.465 --> 00:14:36.405
and obeying this prophet, something

311
00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:37.605
that Saul had never done.

312
00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:38.885
That was the contrast, right?

313
00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:41.605
Saul and David handling differently. The ways of God.

314
00:14:41.995 --> 00:14:45.975
Here he hears from the prophet, he says,

315
00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:47.015
okay, I'm going.

316
00:14:49.595 --> 00:14:51.845
And so we saw that sin brings consequences.

317
00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:55.285
But similarly, when David trusted the Lord here,

318
00:14:56.185 --> 00:14:59.205
it brought about powerful deliverances in his life.

319
00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:02.835
Sin brings consequences.

320
00:15:03.295 --> 00:15:07.155
But trusting the Lord brings about powerful deliverances.

321
00:15:11.735 --> 00:15:13.195
We already see it start here.

322
00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.965
You remember in the first two verses of chapter 22,

323
00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:20.165
there's all these, these ragtag group

324
00:15:20.165 --> 00:15:21.685
of warriors showing up around David.

325
00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:25.875
400 men who were disenfranchised with Saul.

326
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:28.155
They believed God over anything else. All these things.

327
00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.115
They see David as the king and they wanted to be with him.

328
00:15:30.605 --> 00:15:35.235
Those 400 end up being the mighty men of valor Later

329
00:15:35.265 --> 00:15:38.435
that David sees God do amazing things

330
00:15:39.795 --> 00:15:42.495
to free his people and to redeem his people

331
00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:43.895
and to defeat enemies.

332
00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:47.735
God starts the deliverance process even here.

333
00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:52.985
But, but notice even like consequences

334
00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.505
of sin can often be delayed.

335
00:15:55.665 --> 00:15:59.035
Sometimes Deliverances can often be delayed.

336
00:15:59.035 --> 00:16:00.235
They were for David here.

337
00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:03.515
'cause David doesn't get back into the kingship,

338
00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.635
doesn't get back into Jerusalem immediately.

339
00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:07.875
He's on the run for months.

340
00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:10.895
Even though God says, I got you,

341
00:16:12.085 --> 00:16:15.225
here's the deliverance I'm bringing months later

342
00:16:16.045 --> 00:16:17.425
is when it actually showed up.

343
00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:20.455
But, but see it here.

344
00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:25.505
Every time David placed his trust in the Lord

345
00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:29.505
with Goliath, with Saul here, every time

346
00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:34.065
God came through in deliverance, God was

347
00:16:35.015 --> 00:16:37.345
showing up just the right time.

348
00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:40.065
God was blessing that it was all

349
00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:44.355
because he trusted God when he took it into his own hands.

350
00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:48.605
Consequences when he trusted God deliverance.

351
00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:55.745
So see, this suffering was the training camp

352
00:16:55.855 --> 00:17:00.435
that God used in David's life to prepare David

353
00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:03.995
to be the humble dependent king

354
00:17:04.105 --> 00:17:05.675
that God wanted him to be.

355
00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:09.355
He didn't want him to end up like Saul.

356
00:17:09.455 --> 00:17:11.075
So he took him through all of these things

357
00:17:11.135 --> 00:17:14.355
to watch him grow into the man of God.

358
00:17:14.415 --> 00:17:17.825
He was, it was hard,

359
00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:22.145
but it was necessary for David

360
00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:23.505
to be the greatest king of Israel.

361
00:17:26.235 --> 00:17:28.655
See, there's so many parallels between

362
00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:31.175
what David was experiencing to what we experienced today.

363
00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:35.505
I mean, just think about where David was in this process.

364
00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:40.955
He was not home yet. He was in exile.

365
00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:44.575
He was on the run from an enemy

366
00:17:46.385 --> 00:17:48.125
and he was living around people

367
00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:51.405
who did not share the same beliefs about God that he did.

368
00:17:54.735 --> 00:17:55.945
Does that not sound familiar?

369
00:17:58.685 --> 00:18:02.215
Does that not sound like what you and I face every day?

370
00:18:06.015 --> 00:18:10.175
Scripture is clear that Jesus's kingdom is not

371
00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:11.255
of this world.

372
00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:14.975
So if we are in him,

373
00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:18.975
then this world is not our home.

374
00:18:20.985 --> 00:18:24.635
Philippians three 20, our citizenship is in heaven.

375
00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.585
So, so think about that.

376
00:18:28.135 --> 00:18:32.905
That means we are foreigners in a hostile land just like

377
00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:34.925
David was, right?

378
00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:38.445
David's on the run, he's not home, he's not secure.

379
00:18:38.555 --> 00:18:40.125
He's in all these other countries.

380
00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:41.565
He's running through the desert.

381
00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:43.885
He's a foreigner in a hostile land.

382
00:18:44.065 --> 00:18:47.065
We are too Christian.

383
00:18:47.525 --> 00:18:51.105
We are foreigners in a hostile land.

384
00:18:53.725 --> 00:18:56.665
Now again, most of us don't have Saul trying to kill us,

385
00:18:57.085 --> 00:19:01.305
but we are just as much aliens and strangers here.

386
00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:08.245
We're not home yet. We're on the run from an enemy

387
00:19:09.855 --> 00:19:11.515
and we live around people

388
00:19:11.615 --> 00:19:14.355
who don't share the same beliefs about God as we do,

389
00:19:16.235 --> 00:19:19.095
in fact are often hostile to us.

390
00:19:21.055 --> 00:19:25.645
So what should we do? How do we respond to that?

391
00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:29.465
Lemme give you a couple ideas.

392
00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:33.745
First, we must stop denying the reality

393
00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.265
of the danger we are in.

394
00:19:38.395 --> 00:19:41.245
Stop denying the reality of the danger.

395
00:19:43.645 --> 00:19:46.745
See, David could not be in denial about

396
00:19:46.765 --> 00:19:47.985
his situation, right?

397
00:19:49.995 --> 00:19:51.375
He had to acknowledge it.

398
00:19:54.045 --> 00:19:57.785
In fact, he did very clearly in Psalm 34

399
00:19:57.845 --> 00:20:01.905
and Psalm 56, which we believe based on the heading

400
00:20:01.925 --> 00:20:04.785
of those two, that David wrote those in the

401
00:20:04.785 --> 00:20:06.025
midst of this trial.

402
00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:10.225
In chapter 21, he's on the run, he's living in caves.

403
00:20:10.415 --> 00:20:11.945
He's trying to run away from Saul.

404
00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:13.985
And he writes Psalm 34

405
00:20:14.245 --> 00:20:17.025
and Psalm 56, I would encourage you to go find those later.

406
00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:18.665
Go read through them completely.

407
00:20:18.765 --> 00:20:20.505
Now that you have the picture of the story,

408
00:20:20.885 --> 00:20:24.185
how he was feeling and how he responded.

409
00:20:26.255 --> 00:20:29.245
Lemme give you an example. This is Psalm 56

410
00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:30.485
verses one and two.

411
00:20:31.535 --> 00:20:33.365
David says, be gracious to me.

412
00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:37.825
Oh God, for man tramples on me all day long.

413
00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:39.385
An attacker oppresses me.

414
00:20:40.885 --> 00:20:43.225
My enemies trample on me all day long

415
00:20:43.405 --> 00:20:45.945
for many attack me proudly.

416
00:20:48.275 --> 00:20:52.525
Like David was not in denial about the danger he was in.

417
00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.525
It cannot be any different for us

418
00:20:57.955 --> 00:21:01.365
like it does us no good to stick our head in the sand

419
00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.725
and claim that everything's fine.

420
00:21:02.835 --> 00:21:05.205
Like it's all good. No problems, right?

421
00:21:07.255 --> 00:21:09.655
Just denying reality. The reality is if we are living

422
00:21:09.755 --> 00:21:12.495
to advance the gospel, trouble will come.

423
00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:22.175
It might be variable depending on the cultural environment

424
00:21:22.175 --> 00:21:23.295
in which we live, right?

425
00:21:23.405 --> 00:21:27.695
Some places, sometimes it'll be harder or easier dependent.

426
00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:31.535
Yes, but Jesus himself said it,

427
00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:35.535
John 1633, in the world, you will have trouble.

428
00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:40.165
Not you might, you will.

429
00:21:44.335 --> 00:21:48.325
But remember those hardships, the trouble

430
00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:53.245
are the training camp that God will use

431
00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:58.805
to prove your faith, to grow your dependence on him.

432
00:22:00.705 --> 00:22:05.485
If we see it that way, like we,

433
00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:10.245
we could see it as just punishment and hardship

434
00:22:10.305 --> 00:22:14.125
or we could see it as God using it to refine us.

435
00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:16.405
Yet here's, here's something we don't need to do.

436
00:22:16.405 --> 00:22:21.075
At the same time, yes, trouble will come,

437
00:22:21.095 --> 00:22:25.035
but we don't need to do anything to increase the danger

438
00:22:25.615 --> 00:22:27.235
by our own foolishness.

439
00:22:31.795 --> 00:22:33.815
We must avoid increasing the danger in

440
00:22:33.815 --> 00:22:34.935
the world that we face.

441
00:22:35.525 --> 00:22:36.135
Foolishly,

442
00:22:39.365 --> 00:22:40.555
maybe you can relate to this.

443
00:22:40.745 --> 00:22:42.715
I've certainly done it myself.

444
00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:45.475
I will blame the world

445
00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:50.075
or blame the enemy for something that I brought on myself.

446
00:22:50.735 --> 00:22:51.835
Anyone ever done that before?

447
00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:53.995
Like you, you know what I mean by that?

448
00:22:53.995 --> 00:22:55.875
Here's, here's what I mean. I'll make a foolish decision

449
00:22:57.015 --> 00:22:58.115
or I will sin.

450
00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:03.115
And instead of taking ownership for the day, the difficulty

451
00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.875
that it brings in my life, I'll point the finger at Satan.

452
00:23:05.945 --> 00:23:07.675
I'll point the finger at the world.

453
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.635
Like, man, the devil's really coming after me right now.

454
00:23:11.665 --> 00:23:14.035
Like both spiritual warfare is really strong.

455
00:23:14.575 --> 00:23:17.075
No, I was just a fool and I'm paying for it, right?

456
00:23:17.075 --> 00:23:19.275
Like don't, don't shift the blame.

457
00:23:23.165 --> 00:23:24.385
And so how does that apply here?

458
00:23:24.385 --> 00:23:26.745
Well, well again, some would argue

459
00:23:26.745 --> 00:23:28.985
that David's in wartime mentality right here.

460
00:23:29.005 --> 00:23:30.625
And so some things are not as black

461
00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:32.665
and white like think of, you know, lying

462
00:23:32.685 --> 00:23:35.545
to protect the Jews in the Nazi Germany area.

463
00:23:35.615 --> 00:23:36.905
Like, okay, there's some things

464
00:23:36.905 --> 00:23:38.265
that maybe it's gray, alright?

465
00:23:38.445 --> 00:23:42.345
But the reality is that most of us are not in

466
00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:45.645
nor ever will be in a situation like that.

467
00:23:48.465 --> 00:23:51.195
Most of us, most of our lives simply

468
00:23:51.755 --> 00:23:54.395
increase the danger we face through our own foolishness.

469
00:23:57.285 --> 00:23:59.775
Like we poke and prod on social media

470
00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:02.375
and we wonder why we get a rise outta people.

471
00:24:06.785 --> 00:24:09.965
We refuse to listen to wise counsel soul.

472
00:24:11.395 --> 00:24:14.885
Instead, we go our own way and we get in all kinds of messes

473
00:24:18.215 --> 00:24:22.195
or we arrogantly stride into temptation

474
00:24:22.955 --> 00:24:24.955
thinking we're stronger than we really are.

475
00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:33.905
We neglect time in God's word in prayer with brothers

476
00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:34.945
and sisters in the church.

477
00:24:35.565 --> 00:24:38.825
And then we wonder why we miss the fact

478
00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:41.225
that the enemy is duping us every day.

479
00:24:45.675 --> 00:24:47.095
See, there will be risk

480
00:24:47.155 --> 00:24:48.655
and danger in following Jesus,

481
00:24:48.765 --> 00:24:50.455
even when we're doing it righteously.

482
00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:53.495
Let's not add to it by our own foolishness,

483
00:24:55.115 --> 00:24:58.265
which David seemed to do here a little bit at least.

484
00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:05.355
But then the follow up question is, what happens if we do?

485
00:25:06.145 --> 00:25:07.635
What happens if we do blow it?

486
00:25:07.655 --> 00:25:09.755
We do increase danger foolishly.

487
00:25:09.755 --> 00:25:12.355
We do some stuff that's gonna get us in trouble.

488
00:25:12.425 --> 00:25:17.265
Well, despite our failures, remember

489
00:25:17.295 --> 00:25:20.345
that God's mercies are new every morning.

490
00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:28.875
We have to remember this, that

491
00:25:28.895 --> 00:25:30.275
for sinners like us,

492
00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:34.565
God's mercies are new every morning.

493
00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:41.335
Again, remember David, he had tried to escape danger

494
00:25:41.335 --> 00:25:44.415
through his own efforts instead

495
00:25:44.535 --> 00:25:46.415
of trusting in God.

496
00:25:46.675 --> 00:25:48.655
So what did he need to do? He needed to repent.

497
00:25:48.835 --> 00:25:51.255
He needed to turn away from that and turn back to God.

498
00:25:52.645 --> 00:25:57.565
Well, graciously he knew what Lamentations

499
00:25:58.695 --> 00:26:02.405
three verses 22 and 23 would say.

500
00:26:05.645 --> 00:26:08.825
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.

501
00:26:10.175 --> 00:26:12.235
His mercies never come to an end.

502
00:26:12.385 --> 00:26:14.355
They are new every morning.

503
00:26:16.045 --> 00:26:17.915
Great is your faithfulness.

504
00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:21.975
And you know how we knew He knew that?

505
00:26:22.085 --> 00:26:23.375
Because later in his life

506
00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:25.975
after the biggest sin he would ever commit,

507
00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:32.335
he wrote Psalm 51, which is

508
00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:36.775
the preeminent example of what it means to turn back to God

509
00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:38.335
after you blow it.

510
00:26:40.835 --> 00:26:43.805
And this is what it says, have mercy on me.

511
00:26:43.825 --> 00:26:47.895
Oh God, according to your steadfast love.

512
00:26:47.895 --> 00:26:51.265
Does that not sound like Lamentations three, according

513
00:26:51.285 --> 00:26:54.745
to your abundant mercy, blot out my transgressions.

514
00:26:55.535 --> 00:26:57.625
Wash me. I shall be wider than snow.

515
00:26:57.885 --> 00:27:02.225
Create in me a clean heart. Renew a right spirit within me.

516
00:27:02.485 --> 00:27:05.305
Do you see the forgiving mercy there?

517
00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:10.355
And remember, this is pre Christ.

518
00:27:11.385 --> 00:27:14.835
This is long before they knew the mercy of God.

519
00:27:14.865 --> 00:27:17.395
Like we can know the mercy of God.

520
00:27:17.665 --> 00:27:19.595
Just listen to Titus chapter three.

521
00:27:19.955 --> 00:27:22.075
Describe it when the goodness

522
00:27:22.655 --> 00:27:26.595
and loving kindness of God our savior appeared.

523
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:28.835
He saved us not

524
00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:31.195
because of works done by us in righteousness,

525
00:27:31.375 --> 00:27:34.115
but according to his own mercy, by the washing

526
00:27:34.535 --> 00:27:37.955
of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.

527
00:27:40.675 --> 00:27:42.535
That's who God is. Church, right?

528
00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:44.015
That's who we need to remember.

529
00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:47.255
We are looking to, when you blow it, when you walk

530
00:27:47.255 --> 00:27:51.495
by the flesh instead of by his spirit, there is mercy there.

531
00:27:53.285 --> 00:27:55.215
Does that mean you take advantage of it?

532
00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:56.335
Take it for granted? No.

533
00:27:56.335 --> 00:27:58.015
It means you should be so overwhelmed by it

534
00:27:58.015 --> 00:28:00.575
that you can't help but say, man, I deserve death.

535
00:28:00.975 --> 00:28:03.775
I get new life. Instead, what am I gonna do?

536
00:28:03.795 --> 00:28:08.145
But give my life to you? And you get that

537
00:28:08.725 --> 00:28:11.825
all because you trust in Jesus's death

538
00:28:11.925 --> 00:28:14.065
and resurrection in your place.

539
00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:19.915
That's mercy. That's that's mercy

540
00:28:21.105 --> 00:28:24.695
that David began to understand more

541
00:28:24.695 --> 00:28:27.415
and more about as he drew nearer to his God.

542
00:28:31.465 --> 00:28:32.805
And listen, this is a journey

543
00:28:35.995 --> 00:28:37.185
David had to grow.

544
00:28:38.045 --> 00:28:39.825
He didn't have it all figured out at the beginning.

545
00:28:39.845 --> 00:28:41.225
He was a man after God's own heart

546
00:28:41.225 --> 00:28:42.905
and still blew it a couple times and many times

547
00:28:43.085 --> 00:28:47.025
and different ways as we journey home.

548
00:28:48.065 --> 00:28:50.865
'cause we're not home yet. As we journey home in the midst

549
00:28:50.965 --> 00:28:55.025
of this hostile land, as we stumble our way

550
00:28:55.025 --> 00:28:59.825
through all of this, what's the sustaining hope?

551
00:28:59.895 --> 00:29:03.065
It's mercy. But there's also something at the end,

552
00:29:03.065 --> 00:29:04.385
something we can lean on.

553
00:29:06.055 --> 00:29:08.675
Here's what it is. We can trust

554
00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:11.195
that God's redemption is coming.

555
00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.725
We can trust that God's redemption is coming.

556
00:29:19.785 --> 00:29:22.965
And it appears that that's what David did

557
00:29:25.315 --> 00:29:27.045
towards the end of this training camp.

558
00:29:27.505 --> 00:29:29.125
It seems like he finally got it.

559
00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:33.155
He, he finally grasped this idea that,

560
00:29:33.185 --> 00:29:34.595
that I need to trust the Lord.

561
00:29:34.715 --> 00:29:36.515
I need to listen to God through his prophet.

562
00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:40.995
I need to do this. I can't trust myself. I got to trust him.

563
00:29:41.505 --> 00:29:43.325
And he might have been the whole time, we don't know that.

564
00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:44.805
We can't see in behind the scenes,

565
00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:48.205
but what we know here, sure seems like he grew into that

566
00:29:51.495 --> 00:29:52.915
and, and it's gonna happen to us too.

567
00:29:52.915 --> 00:29:54.755
Maybe God will give you crafty ways

568
00:29:54.755 --> 00:29:55.955
to get outta the enemy's attacks.

569
00:29:56.115 --> 00:29:57.235
I don't know. Okay, that's fine.

570
00:29:57.295 --> 00:30:01.875
But it sure seems like David finally put his life in God's

571
00:30:01.965 --> 00:30:03.555
hands in chapter 22.

572
00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:07.685
You see it in verse three.

573
00:30:08.505 --> 00:30:12.005
He said, till I know what God will do for me,

574
00:30:14.105 --> 00:30:16.845
he, he was waiting on God till I know

575
00:30:16.845 --> 00:30:17.885
what God's gonna do for me.

576
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:21.005
Even the prophet, did you see that?

577
00:30:21.005 --> 00:30:23.285
The prophet, when he said, Hey David, you need

578
00:30:23.285 --> 00:30:24.405
to go back to Judah.

579
00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:27.325
He was sending him back towards Saul.

580
00:30:30.065 --> 00:30:31.965
And what did David do? Like, no, I can't go back.

581
00:30:32.085 --> 00:30:33.285
I can't do, no, he went.

582
00:30:33.825 --> 00:30:37.685
He went willingly because he trusted God.

583
00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:44.665
Think about even this army, this 400 men

584
00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:49.065
that were gathering around David, they could have tried

585
00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:53.745
a counter attack to go take out Saul first, right?

586
00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:55.545
That's what a, an army would typically do, right?

587
00:30:55.545 --> 00:30:57.145
In a battle. You're like, well if they're coming

588
00:30:57.145 --> 00:30:58.945
after our leader, let's go get their leader.

589
00:30:59.965 --> 00:31:01.385
And these were skilled warriors.

590
00:31:01.385 --> 00:31:05.985
They could have done it, but David didn't.

591
00:31:08.355 --> 00:31:12.775
And really the entire rest of the book, he has opportunities

592
00:31:13.235 --> 00:31:15.135
to take out Saul and he doesn't do it.

593
00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:18.275
'cause he knew that was wrong. He knew that was not

594
00:31:18.275 --> 00:31:20.115
what God wanted from him.

595
00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:22.675
He chose to trust God.

596
00:31:23.065 --> 00:31:25.435
Instead, he trusted God with Goliath.

597
00:31:25.475 --> 00:31:27.235
Couldn't he trust God with Saul?

598
00:31:31.565 --> 00:31:36.105
And we see this again in Psalm 34

599
00:31:36.325 --> 00:31:37.625
and Psalm 56.

600
00:31:37.925 --> 00:31:40.985
Go read these later. But this is David in the middle.

601
00:31:40.995 --> 00:31:43.865
Watch this Psalm 34, verses six and seven.

602
00:31:44.165 --> 00:31:47.545
He says, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him

603
00:31:48.005 --> 00:31:51.065
and saved him out of all his troubles.

604
00:31:51.805 --> 00:31:54.265
The angel of the Lord Enc camps around those

605
00:31:54.285 --> 00:31:56.145
who fear him and delivers them.

606
00:31:57.625 --> 00:32:02.495
Psalm 34 17, when the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears

607
00:32:02.755 --> 00:32:05.695
and delivers them out of all their troubles,

608
00:32:07.345 --> 00:32:11.165
34 19, many are the afflictions of the righteous,

609
00:32:11.305 --> 00:32:16.045
but the Lord delivers him out of them all 34 22.

610
00:32:16.185 --> 00:32:18.605
The Lord redeems the life of his servants.

611
00:32:18.795 --> 00:32:22.565
None of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.

612
00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:27.325
And then this is Psalm 56 verses three

613
00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:30.805
and four, he says, David says, when I am afraid,

614
00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:33.875
I put my trust in you.

615
00:32:35.255 --> 00:32:40.205
In God whose word I praise in God, I trust

616
00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.005
I shall not be afraid.

617
00:32:43.035 --> 00:32:45.165
What can flesh do to me?

618
00:32:48.335 --> 00:32:50.745
Like is that not an amazing statement?

619
00:32:51.935 --> 00:32:53.485
Jesus said something similar later,

620
00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:58.655
but David says, notice in the middle

621
00:32:59.435 --> 00:33:03.405
of the hardships in the training camp,

622
00:33:04.185 --> 00:33:07.245
as Saul isn't trying to kill him,

623
00:33:09.305 --> 00:33:11.055
David says, what can flesh do to me?

624
00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:15.155
What can that guy, what can that guy do to me?

625
00:33:17.925 --> 00:33:19.545
Notice David had learned

626
00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:22.945
to trust his God, his deliver.

627
00:33:27.955 --> 00:33:29.095
Can we not do the same?

628
00:33:32.645 --> 00:33:36.745
Can we not see the training camp that he's putting you

629
00:33:36.745 --> 00:33:41.465
through right now is his means to get you to trust him more.

630
00:33:44.665 --> 00:33:48.445
To trust that God will resolve all the mess that's

631
00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:53.175
around us, to trust not

632
00:33:53.175 --> 00:33:55.935
ourselves, but trust that God will redeem us

633
00:33:56.155 --> 00:33:57.775
and will take us home one day.

634
00:33:58.285 --> 00:34:01.015
That we don't have to use cunning and all of our wisdom

635
00:34:01.115 --> 00:34:03.415
and all of our skills and all of our resources

636
00:34:03.435 --> 00:34:04.455
to try to fix it all.

637
00:34:04.795 --> 00:34:07.455
No. 'cause remember this,

638
00:34:07.675 --> 00:34:11.575
our ultimate hope is not in figuring out how to get all

639
00:34:11.575 --> 00:34:15.615
of this back to a comfortable, secure, peaceful state.

640
00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:17.895
It's just not. That can't be our hope.

641
00:34:20.895 --> 00:34:22.835
Our hope is only in the fact

642
00:34:22.945 --> 00:34:24.915
that God will redeem all of this.

643
00:34:25.095 --> 00:34:27.355
He will bring restoration someday.

644
00:34:32.225 --> 00:34:33.645
But how do we consider this rightly?

645
00:34:36.645 --> 00:34:40.855
Well, always we read the text, we read the scripture,

646
00:34:41.035 --> 00:34:44.295
we see the world through the lenses of Jesus Christ.

647
00:34:45.935 --> 00:34:47.595
And so as we consider this idea

648
00:34:47.595 --> 00:34:50.275
of trusting God in the training camp, looking

649
00:34:50.335 --> 00:34:53.315
to his restoration, our minds should go to

650
00:34:53.315 --> 00:34:56.035
how Jesus trusted his father.

651
00:34:58.325 --> 00:35:03.105
So think about this. Jesus willingly

652
00:35:03.255 --> 00:35:06.825
submitted to his father's plan, which by the way

653
00:35:07.385 --> 00:35:08.585
included his suffering

654
00:35:11.085 --> 00:35:13.175
because he knew of the redemption

655
00:35:13.285 --> 00:35:14.855
that was going to be brought on the other side.

656
00:35:15.795 --> 00:35:20.235
He was the ultimate

657
00:35:20.865 --> 00:35:22.955
foreigner in a hostile land.

658
00:35:24.915 --> 00:35:29.135
Yet his purpose was to live, die, and resurrect so that you

659
00:35:29.135 --> 00:35:30.935
and I could have a hope and a future.

660
00:35:34.135 --> 00:35:36.105
Plus, he never stretched the truth.

661
00:35:38.015 --> 00:35:39.715
He never acted foolishly.

662
00:35:41.275 --> 00:35:45.575
Yet he took our severe

663
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:50.175
consequences to give us powerful deliverance.

664
00:35:53.065 --> 00:35:54.605
And so see what's happening here, right?

665
00:35:54.695 --> 00:35:57.325
David was a fallen, imperfect hero.

666
00:35:58.585 --> 00:36:01.245
But Christ is the perfect David.

667
00:36:01.745 --> 00:36:05.205
Our champion is the one who's going to bring us hope forever

668
00:36:05.585 --> 00:36:06.605
and ever and ever.

669
00:36:07.735 --> 00:36:09.745
Like. So David's limited picture,

670
00:36:09.805 --> 00:36:14.305
fallen picture is pointing us to the greater David, to Jesus

671
00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:17.865
who was fully dependent on his Father in all the ways

672
00:36:17.865 --> 00:36:20.185
that David failed in all the ways that you and I fail.

673
00:36:24.675 --> 00:36:28.415
And so the question again, how are we gonna respond

674
00:36:28.435 --> 00:36:33.415
to the training camp that we're in related?

675
00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:37.575
How dependent on him are you

676
00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:43.085
like just at ground level?

677
00:36:45.405 --> 00:36:46.985
Do you really depend on him?

678
00:36:48.965 --> 00:36:52.985
Do you really depend on him? Often? Here's the reality.

679
00:36:53.345 --> 00:36:56.185
I so often I need

680
00:36:56.185 --> 00:36:58.345
to stop trusting my own strength

681
00:36:58.645 --> 00:37:02.705
and start trusting the Lord to deliver me, to empower me

682
00:37:02.765 --> 00:37:03.865
to work through me.

683
00:37:06.755 --> 00:37:07.815
Is that true for you two?

684
00:37:12.505 --> 00:37:13.645
Do you need to trust him more?

685
00:37:13.645 --> 00:37:14.845
Do you need to depend on him more

686
00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:15.925
so that he flows through you?

687
00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:18.405
Okay, so the question is, what do you do with that today?

688
00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:20.005
How do you do that today?

689
00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:22.325
What do you need to do today to get there?

690
00:37:23.665 --> 00:37:28.525
How can you become more dependent on the indwelling one,

691
00:37:28.545 --> 00:37:29.845
the spirit we sang about earlier?

692
00:37:30.065 --> 00:37:33.325
How can you be more filled with him?

693
00:37:33.665 --> 00:37:37.325
Who gives you the power that you need to live this life?

694
00:37:40.765 --> 00:37:44.135
Because we are foreigners in a hostile land

695
00:37:46.155 --> 00:37:51.095
and this training camp is far too difficult for us

696
00:37:51.095 --> 00:37:52.175
to make it through on our own.

697
00:37:55.015 --> 00:37:58.275
And so what do you do with that? You lean on Christ,

698
00:38:00.215 --> 00:38:02.155
you lean on him, and you trust

699
00:38:02.465 --> 00:38:05.395
that his redemption is coming someday.

700
00:38:05.695 --> 00:38:09.875
And you can have all of that hope to help you make it

701
00:38:09.875 --> 00:38:12.435
through the hard days that are here.

702
00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:14.515
That's what he does.
