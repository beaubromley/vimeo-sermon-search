1
00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:17.085
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.605
Well, it's great to see all of you today, church,

7
00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.525
whether you're new to our church just checking us out

8
00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.925
or whether you've been here for 50 years, uh,

9
00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.285
this is a great opportunity we have every Sunday

10
00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:38.525
to gather together to worship like this, especially on this,

11
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:40.045
uh, father's Day where we're thankful

12
00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:41.605
for the godly men in our lives

13
00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:44.445
who have made an eternal impact on us.

14
00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:49.365
Uh, and especially though on days like this, we do look

15
00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:51.005
to our perfect heavenly Father.

16
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.125
'cause I know some days like this can be hard.

17
00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:56.885
And so if it is hard for you today, for whatever reason,

18
00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:59.005
just remember to look to him

19
00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:02.925
as our father in heaven, who he is.

20
00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:05.885
Remember that well as now

21
00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.245
that you've seen in the last few weeks and most summers.

22
00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:11.925
And, and most other times in the year that we have sort

23
00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:14.885
of these filling in the gaps kind of Sundays

24
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:16.245
where we're not doing a series,

25
00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:20.765
we just pick up the next Psalm in our, uh, journey

26
00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:23.325
through the Psalms one, one by one,

27
00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:24.645
just whatever the next one is

28
00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:29.005
until we eventually make our way through all 150 of them.

29
00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:32.405
Key word eventually, right? We'll get there someday.

30
00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:37.125
But last week, Psalm 67 was such a blessing, uh,

31
00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:38.325
if you were a part of that here

32
00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.205
or if you caught it online, it was such a blessing.

33
00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:43.765
One that's been quite formative in my life over the years.

34
00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:47.445
Something that I just pray that God would use to,

35
00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:50.845
to bear good fruit, to lodge it deeply within us

36
00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:54.125
and then bring us to a good place powerfully.

37
00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:56.845
Uh, we pray that that would happen now.

38
00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:59.325
Now, God has a funny way of keeping me humble

39
00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:03.445
because, uh, as top as, as top of the mountain as

40
00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:07.605
that one was last week as sweet a time it was felt so filled

41
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:08.885
with the spirit in that.

42
00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:12.485
And, and then we come upon Psalm 68,

43
00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:17.925
which as I was reading all week, nearly every commentator

44
00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:21.725
said, this is the most difficult Psalm to interpret.

45
00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:25.725
Like of all 150 of them,

46
00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:28.845
this one's the hardest.

47
00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:32.165
So I invite the worship leaders come back out

48
00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:35.165
and we're gonna get no, no,

49
00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:36.765
like seriously kind of thought about it.

50
00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.205
Just let's skip it.

51
00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:40.045
But seriously, that's the struggle we face today.

52
00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:41.525
And it just happened to be VBS Week

53
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:43.365
where all of this is going on.

54
00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:45.005
It was a great time, but,

55
00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:48.805
but let listen, I, I think that struggle is also a blessing.

56
00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:53.605
The fact that it doesn't just jump off the page like last

57
00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:56.735
week, that it's not just an obvious,

58
00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.925
it forces us to, to press into the Lord a little bit,

59
00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:08.845
to dig a little deeper, to work at it, to move

60
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.085
beyond the surface.

61
00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:13.165
So that's what we're gonna try to do today.

62
00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:16.125
We're gonna ask God for his insight that he would teach us

63
00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:18.205
through this challenge.

64
00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:21.165
God, thank you. Thank you for your word.

65
00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:22.325
Thank you for your spirit

66
00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:26.205
that shows us what we need to know.

67
00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:27.645
So we pray that you would do that.

68
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:31.725
Pray that you take this, that is a challenge

69
00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:36.485
for various reasons and you would show us the beauty

70
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:39.965
of your word and how you work it all out.

71
00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.485
Work it together for your glory, for our good,

72
00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:47.165
and that you would open our eyes and our hearts to see

73
00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:48.965
and understand what you want

74
00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:52.685
to change us with today.

75
00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:57.445
For your glory, we pray. Give us insight. Give us wisdom.

76
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.605
In Jesus' name. Amen.

77
00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:05.885
So I've been studying Psalms for years now as we've walked

78
00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:08.325
through this and, and as I've studied it recently,

79
00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:10.885
this theme kept popping up of, of

80
00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:12.445
what it was saying was the theme

81
00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:14.205
of the entire book of Psalms.

82
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:17.085
I just happened to start catching that recently.

83
00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:18.885
I don't know why I missed it before, but,

84
00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:22.605
but if you had to sum up the entire book, the theme

85
00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:24.845
of all 150 together,

86
00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.165
it would be this God rules the world.

87
00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:32.245
Like if you just had to take psalms as a whole, it said,

88
00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:35.085
what is it about God rules it all

89
00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:38.245
so he's worthy of worship and all the things

90
00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:39.365
that these p songs are teaching.

91
00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.445
But really that's the theme. God rules it all.

92
00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.485
And so if we're trying to figure out the meaning

93
00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:45.925
of the hardest psalm in the entire book,

94
00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:48.965
that might be a good place to start just to see if

95
00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:51.165
that's maybe what the meaning of it is.

96
00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:52.965
And so does it work, is the question,

97
00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:55.165
maybe it might not, but does it?

98
00:04:55.835 --> 00:05:00.685
Well, it actually does. And so this psalm is first

99
00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:04.365
and foremost reminding us of God's reign

100
00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:09.255
as the king, R-E-I-G-N, his

101
00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:11.215
rig, his rule.

102
00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:15.535
In fact, it does. So in a similar way to

103
00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:17.655
what we saw last week, we talked about chiasm

104
00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:19.215
and the structure of a passage

105
00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:22.215
and how we can find a tool that uses that and

106
00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:23.695
and learn something from that.

107
00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:24.935
And it's similar in this.

108
00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:27.575
It's not exactly the same, but it's similar to the first

109
00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:29.135
and the last sections kinda match.

110
00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:33.135
And so it shows us there's a, a balancing there.

111
00:05:34.035 --> 00:05:36.575
So you can see it on your notes there, either on your device

112
00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:38.935
or in the paper that verses one through six

113
00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:40.895
and verses 32 through 35

114
00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:46.775
say very similar things about the reign of God, who he is,

115
00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:48.455
what he's done, how he functions.

116
00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:50.615
They they, they're very similar, not exact,

117
00:05:50.635 --> 00:05:53.455
but they're similar in the way they say it.

118
00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:55.895
So look at verses one through six, just to start

119
00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:57.015
with Psalm 68.

120
00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:01.885
Again, there's a heading usually in these

121
00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:03.765
to the choir master a Psalm of David.

122
00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.405
So we know David wrote this at some point, a song

123
00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:07.525
that's meant to be sung.

124
00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:12.965
Verse one, God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered.

125
00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.685
And those who hate him shall flee

126
00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:18.645
before him as smoke is driven away.

127
00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:22.445
So you shall drive them away as wax melts before fire.

128
00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:24.605
So the wicked shall perish before God,

129
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.045
but the righteous shall be glad.

130
00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:29.205
They shall exalt before God.

131
00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:34.045
They shall be jubilant with joy, Sing

132
00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:38.325
to God, sing praises to his name, lift up a song to him

133
00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:39.885
who rides through the deserts.

134
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:45.125
His name is the Lord Yahweh exalt before him.

135
00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:48.045
Father, the fatherless protector

136
00:06:48.045 --> 00:06:50.485
of widows is God in his holy habitation,

137
00:06:51.705 --> 00:06:53.765
God settles the solitary in a home,

138
00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:56.445
he leads out the prisoners to prosperity,

139
00:06:56.865 --> 00:06:59.645
but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.

140
00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:02.445
So that's the first section.

141
00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:06.085
Now look down at the end verses 32 through 35.

142
00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:08.565
See the similarities here.

143
00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:16.725
Oh, kingdoms of the earth sing to God, sing praises

144
00:07:16.825 --> 00:07:21.325
to the Lord, sayah to him who rides in the heavens,

145
00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:22.445
the ancient heavens.

146
00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:25.205
Behold, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice

147
00:07:26.475 --> 00:07:30.005
ascribe power to God whose majesty is over Israel,

148
00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:32.125
whose power is in the skies.

149
00:07:33.075 --> 00:07:37.045
Awesome is God from his sanctuary, the God of Israel.

150
00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:40.165
He is the one who gives power and strength to his people.

151
00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:42.645
Blessed be God.

152
00:07:44.405 --> 00:07:47.225
So again, they're not the same, but you see similarities.

153
00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:49.185
You see this idea of who he is,

154
00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.225
what we should do in response, that he's the king

155
00:07:53.025 --> 00:07:54.545
reigning over all things.

156
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.585
He's worthy of praise.

157
00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:58.065
No one can stand against him

158
00:07:58.365 --> 00:08:01.025
and one day all knees will bow before him.

159
00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:03.745
That's the point of both sections.

160
00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:08.705
And so the, the rest of the psalm, you'll see there's a lot

161
00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:09.825
of blood, there's a lot of judgment,

162
00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:11.105
there's a lot of that here.

163
00:08:11.105 --> 00:08:13.985
And you even saw it here in this first section a little bit.

164
00:08:15.445 --> 00:08:17.705
And what that could turn into is this feeling that

165
00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:20.385
that God is something other than he really is.

166
00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:22.465
But don't miss again, look at verses five

167
00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:27.485
and six about this king over the universe.

168
00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:29.845
Father of the fatherless, protector

169
00:08:29.845 --> 00:08:31.805
of widows is God in his holy habitation.

170
00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:34.845
He settles the solitary in a home,

171
00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:38.125
he leads out the prisoners to prosperity.

172
00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:40.885
But the rebellious dwell in a parched land.

173
00:08:42.865 --> 00:08:47.405
See, don't think of God as some blood thirsty tyrant

174
00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:50.875
when this is who he is.

175
00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:54.435
A God of compassion, a god of care

176
00:08:55.355 --> 00:08:58.405
that he has his eye on the vulnerable.

177
00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:03.125
In fact, that kinda language is very similar to

178
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:08.085
what God predicted of the Messiah in Isaiah's prophecy.

179
00:09:08.085 --> 00:09:10.245
This is Isaiah chapter 61.

180
00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:14.045
Listen to this, the spirit of the Lord God is upon me.

181
00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:15.165
That's just talking the Messiah

182
00:09:15.235 --> 00:09:17.165
because the Lord has anointed me

183
00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.085
to bring good news to the poor.

184
00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:22.285
He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted,

185
00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:25.845
to proclaim liberty to the captives, the opening

186
00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:27.725
of the prison to those who are bound

187
00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:30.485
to proclaim the year the Lord's favor, the day of vengeance

188
00:09:30.485 --> 00:09:35.325
of our God to comfort all who mourn, to grant to those

189
00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.325
who mourn in Zion,

190
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.885
to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes.

191
00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:42.685
The oil of gladness instead of mourning the garment

192
00:09:42.685 --> 00:09:44.205
of praise instead of a faint spirit

193
00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:47.485
that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting

194
00:09:47.485 --> 00:09:50.285
of the Lord that he may be glorified.

195
00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:54.925
Maybe you're familiar with the scene

196
00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:58.165
where Jesus walks into the synagogue in Luke four

197
00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:01.365
and he just happens to pick up a scroll

198
00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:03.805
and happens to read it in front of the people.

199
00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:07.035
And what did he read? Isaiah 61.

200
00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:10.035
That's where he was reading from.

201
00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:13.915
And he says, this is happening right now.

202
00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:17.555
I am that messiah that you were looking for

203
00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:20.595
and this is what I came to do.

204
00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:27.155
And so this psalm reminds us of God's rule that he

205
00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:29.355
reigns over the world in righteousness

206
00:10:29.415 --> 00:10:31.315
and judgment, yet also has love

207
00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:32.755
and tenderness for his people,

208
00:10:32.755 --> 00:10:35.635
especially the vulnerable his eyes on them.

209
00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:41.675
And what the rest of this psalm is doing is it's giving

210
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.075
proof of that reign.

211
00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:48.615
David was recounting the history of Israel,

212
00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:52.095
what he believed God would also be in the years

213
00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:53.695
to come forward from him.

214
00:10:55.345 --> 00:10:58.125
He was just saying, this is who our God is.

215
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.765
But the problem we see with this psalm,

216
00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:02.925
the problem every commentator has, everyone

217
00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:06.565
who studied this has is how do we see a structure here?

218
00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:10.885
Now we know poetry is not always gonna have an easy

219
00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:13.365
structure, but there's gotta be something

220
00:11:13.365 --> 00:11:15.005
that we can pick out.

221
00:11:16.965 --> 00:11:18.425
How do we discern it here?

222
00:11:18.455 --> 00:11:20.985
Well, this is we we do, we we read carefully.

223
00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:25.945
Again, remember last week that little word ela,

224
00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:28.945
you see it in a lot of the Psalms.

225
00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:32.225
It was a musical interlude of some sort, a pause

226
00:11:32.405 --> 00:11:34.305
to reflect as they were singing.

227
00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:36.185
It was a measure of rest.

228
00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:38.185
Whatever they were supposed to do

229
00:11:38.185 --> 00:11:39.785
or they were praying it, they were supposed to pause

230
00:11:39.925 --> 00:11:44.145
and consider What we see it here

231
00:11:44.145 --> 00:11:45.305
in this psalm a number of times.

232
00:11:45.445 --> 00:11:49.585
In fact, we can see it probably most likely used as a marker

233
00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:54.085
to outline the major sections of the Psalm.

234
00:11:55.545 --> 00:12:00.445
So you see it in this at the end of verse seven, at the end

235
00:12:00.445 --> 00:12:01.445
of verse 19,

236
00:12:02.865 --> 00:12:07.035
and at the end of verse 32, those are the,

237
00:12:07.145 --> 00:12:10.635
what I'm considering, the first lines of the new sections.

238
00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.035
Each time I made one little tweak.

239
00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:16.275
You'll see that in a moment. But

240
00:12:16.275 --> 00:12:18.235
what these section headers do is they kind

241
00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:21.835
of mark off time in a way that they look back,

242
00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:24.835
they look at the present and they look at the future.

243
00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:28.515
And you'll see it kinda walking through this whole psalm.

244
00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:30.995
There's a measure of past, present, future.

245
00:12:31.175 --> 00:12:33.435
It starts with and ends with those sections

246
00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:35.875
that are reminding us of God's reign.

247
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.755
But in between, there are these sections that deal

248
00:12:38.755 --> 00:12:41.955
with God's work throughout history, things

249
00:12:41.955 --> 00:12:44.035
that prove he is the king.

250
00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:46.625
And you'll see it as we go through this.

251
00:12:47.765 --> 00:12:51.185
And so we take this second section starting in verse seven,

252
00:12:51.465 --> 00:12:53.825
remember that's where the end of that sayah is at the end of

253
00:12:53.825 --> 00:12:56.425
that line, starting with verse seven down through verse 18.

254
00:12:57.535 --> 00:13:00.745
What we see is that God proved his reign overall

255
00:13:01.335 --> 00:13:02.985
from Egypt to Jerusalem.

256
00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:06.055
That's this section. He's kind of looking back

257
00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:07.855
David at this moment,

258
00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:11.495
and he's writing, he's looking back to history of,

259
00:13:11.715 --> 00:13:16.215
of God showing up from Egypt to Jerusalem

260
00:13:16.215 --> 00:13:19.535
where he was, I'm not gonna read the whole section,

261
00:13:19.635 --> 00:13:21.895
but it's a, it's basically a quick summary

262
00:13:21.915 --> 00:13:26.615
of the Exodus narrative where God led his people out

263
00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:28.575
of slavery through the wilderness.

264
00:13:28.795 --> 00:13:32.175
God showed up to prove himself,

265
00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:35.895
leading them out of Egypt.

266
00:13:36.395 --> 00:13:37.575
And just show you verses seven

267
00:13:37.575 --> 00:13:39.175
and eight at least shows us this.

268
00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:40.895
So God, when you went out

269
00:13:40.915 --> 00:13:45.135
before your people, when you march through the wilderness,

270
00:13:45.755 --> 00:13:49.295
cellah, there's that marker, the earthquake,

271
00:13:49.755 --> 00:13:54.095
the heavens poured down rain before God, the one of Sinai

272
00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:56.895
before God, the God of Israel.

273
00:13:58.435 --> 00:14:00.775
So there's, there's just a, a quick encapsulation

274
00:14:00.775 --> 00:14:04.695
of the whole thing right there in a couple verses.

275
00:14:06.255 --> 00:14:09.135
'cause Sinai was the mountain on which God met Moses,

276
00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:13.015
remember God brought him up the mountain, gave him the law,

277
00:14:13.315 --> 00:14:14.935
and he came back down and the whole thing

278
00:14:14.935 --> 00:14:17.295
with the golden calf, all of that, but that's the symbol.

279
00:14:17.425 --> 00:14:20.415
Sinai is the symbol of the exodus.

280
00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:23.935
And so what he did then from

281
00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:25.775
that point is he led them through the wilderness.

282
00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:29.735
That was what we just saw, right? God provided for them.

283
00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:32.175
They, they struggled as any

284
00:14:32.175 --> 00:14:33.375
of us would through the wilderness.

285
00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:34.415
They struggled through that.

286
00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:36.495
But God provided, verse 10 says,

287
00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:39.935
your flock found a dwelling in the wilderness you

288
00:14:40.655 --> 00:14:42.055
provided for them.

289
00:14:42.235 --> 00:14:45.815
So this is again, a picture of God bringing them out

290
00:14:45.815 --> 00:14:47.535
of Egypt, bringing them to something.

291
00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:51.525
In fact, it also alludes to the book of Judges, the battle

292
00:14:52.035 --> 00:14:55.565
between Deborah and Barack against the forces of cera.

293
00:14:56.105 --> 00:14:58.045
You go back and read Judges five about that,

294
00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:01.005
but God was clearing out his enemies from the promised land.

295
00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:04.565
That's all right here in these few verses,

296
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:09.885
even verse one of Psalm 68 alludes to that very thing

297
00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:14.725
because verse one, this is interesting.

298
00:15:14.985 --> 00:15:17.525
It quotes numbers 10 35,

299
00:15:19.105 --> 00:15:21.245
and I know you all read numbers in your quiet time this

300
00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:25.285
morning, but numbers 10 35 is where God told Moses

301
00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:28.285
what they need to say as the Ark

302
00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:30.405
of the covenant would leave the camp.

303
00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:34.445
Listen to this, the Ark of the Covenant, the symbol

304
00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:36.085
of God's presence among his people.

305
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:40.005
It was what God used to lead them to and and the wilderness.

306
00:15:40.395 --> 00:15:42.325
This is what it says. Whenever the ark set out,

307
00:15:42.325 --> 00:15:43.645
Moses said, arise.

308
00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.605
Oh Lord, let your enemies be scattered

309
00:15:47.225 --> 00:15:49.525
and let those who hate you flee before you.

310
00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:54.245
Psalm 68, 1 said almost the exact same thing, right?

311
00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:57.605
So this is a picture what we're seeing of, of

312
00:15:57.605 --> 00:16:01.045
what God was doing to lead his people as the reigning king

313
00:16:01.385 --> 00:16:05.165
to drive out his enemies from the promised land.

314
00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:07.645
Psalm 68 is recounting that.

315
00:16:09.265 --> 00:16:13.085
And so God proved himself from Mount Sinai, the Exodus

316
00:16:13.665 --> 00:16:18.125
now here to Mount Zion, which is Jerusalem,

317
00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:19.165
where God picked

318
00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.485
to be the dwelling place that he would have.

319
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.925
And this is Psalm 68, verses 16 through 18.

320
00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:30.525
Why do you look with hatred?

321
00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:33.085
Oh, many peaked mountain at the Mount,

322
00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:36.205
meaning other mountains at the Mount that God desired

323
00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:37.885
for his abode, for his dwelling place.

324
00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:41.275
Yes, where the Lord will dwell forever.

325
00:16:41.415 --> 00:16:44.035
The chariots of God are twice 10,000

326
00:16:44.715 --> 00:16:45.755
thousands upon thousands.

327
00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:50.555
The Lord is among them. Sinai is now in the sanctuary.

328
00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.835
You ascended on high leading a host

329
00:16:54.855 --> 00:16:58.715
of captives in your train, receiving gifts from men even

330
00:16:58.715 --> 00:17:02.715
among the rebellious that the Lord God may dwell there.

331
00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:08.035
So again, notice David was recounting

332
00:17:10.135 --> 00:17:13.995
how God proved his reign over all things from Egypt

333
00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:16.875
to Mount Sinai through the wilderness

334
00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:19.475
and now to Jerusalem

335
00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.915
to his dwelling place.

336
00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:28.705
God had marched them out of Egypt

337
00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:33.705
and now he had marched up the hill to Mount Zion,

338
00:17:33.725 --> 00:17:35.905
to his dwelling place where the temple was eventually

339
00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:37.025
built by Solomon.

340
00:17:40.485 --> 00:17:43.105
And so David's recounting that, yet that's not it, right?

341
00:17:43.925 --> 00:17:45.665
The Psalm doesn't end at verse 18.

342
00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:49.405
God's not just a past tense God.

343
00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:55.585
Notice what else happens starting in verse 19.

344
00:17:55.945 --> 00:18:00.865
Remember where that word sayah shows up the end of verse 19?

345
00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:06.985
Look at these two verses verse 19, blessed be the Lord

346
00:18:07.485 --> 00:18:09.825
who daily bears us up.

347
00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:12.025
God is our salvation.

348
00:18:12.835 --> 00:18:15.945
Sayah, our God is a God

349
00:18:15.945 --> 00:18:18.425
of salvation and to God.

350
00:18:18.805 --> 00:18:22.745
The Lord belonged deliverances from death.

351
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:27.345
So David is sitting here looking back.

352
00:18:27.925 --> 00:18:30.865
He recounts all that God has done in the past.

353
00:18:31.005 --> 00:18:33.025
But God is not just a past tense God.

354
00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:35.665
He doesn't just rule back then for David,

355
00:18:35.925 --> 00:18:37.585
God also rules day to day.

356
00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:42.385
He ruled from Egypt to Jerusalem, got his people

357
00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:45.305
where they needed to be, where David was at this moment,

358
00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:48.945
yet he still rules every day.

359
00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:55.615
Did you see what it said? Blessed be the Lord

360
00:18:55.715 --> 00:18:59.535
who daily bears us up, carries us,

361
00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:01.375
sustains us, lifts us.

362
00:19:03.795 --> 00:19:04.975
We saw it in verse 35.

363
00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:06.815
He is the one who gives power

364
00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:08.855
and strength to his people, right?

365
00:19:08.925 --> 00:19:10.815
This is David's picture of this God

366
00:19:10.835 --> 00:19:12.375
who he knows, brought them out.

367
00:19:12.675 --> 00:19:14.855
Now He says, God is the one who's with me.

368
00:19:16.325 --> 00:19:19.335
He's bearing me us up.

369
00:19:21.605 --> 00:19:24.665
But see what else this daily proof of God's reign brings.

370
00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:26.625
He says, God is our salvation.

371
00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.545
Our God is a God of salvation. Repeating it for emphasis.

372
00:19:30.685 --> 00:19:32.665
God is a God of salvation.

373
00:19:32.725 --> 00:19:35.665
Now our minds immediately go to eternal salvation.

374
00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:39.065
And we know of course, yes, God is the God of salvation.

375
00:19:39.065 --> 00:19:41.465
Christ is the only way. Yes, we get that.

376
00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:44.265
But here in verse 20, here's what's interesting.

377
00:19:44.265 --> 00:19:46.625
Those words for salvation

378
00:19:47.005 --> 00:19:49.985
and for deliverance are actually plural words.

379
00:19:53.555 --> 00:19:56.855
So what he's saying is that God is a God of salvations,

380
00:19:58.395 --> 00:20:02.295
of deliverances, of escapes.

381
00:20:04.395 --> 00:20:05.405
What does? What does he mean?

382
00:20:08.615 --> 00:20:10.625
What he means is that our lives are in his hands.

383
00:20:12.885 --> 00:20:17.105
Our daily lives are in God's hands. He is our security.

384
00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:19.785
He is our fortress. He is our deliverer.

385
00:20:19.925 --> 00:20:23.425
He is the one who gets us out of all kinds of things.

386
00:20:23.485 --> 00:20:24.705
Here's the reality.

387
00:20:26.645 --> 00:20:29.665
You and I have an enemy of our souls

388
00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:31.985
who is hell bent on destroying us.

389
00:20:33.915 --> 00:20:38.525
Peter calls him a a roaring lion, Satan,

390
00:20:39.065 --> 00:20:42.685
who is trying to destroy us, prowling

391
00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:45.765
around constantly on the attack, looking for ways

392
00:20:46.225 --> 00:20:49.565
to destroy us, which is why second Thessalonians three,

393
00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:53.325
three is such good news that the Lord is faithful.

394
00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:57.405
He will establish you and guard you against the evil one.

395
00:20:59.105 --> 00:21:01.245
So that's a reality that he's coming after us,

396
00:21:01.245 --> 00:21:03.685
but we have a faithful God who is the one

397
00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:06.245
who is holding us safe.

398
00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:09.605
I can't remember where I read this,

399
00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:14.005
but if, if we were allowed just a sliver

400
00:21:14.025 --> 00:21:17.085
of a glimpse into the spiritual realm

401
00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:22.485
to see what's constantly coming at us

402
00:21:25.545 --> 00:21:28.205
and to see how much God is shielding us

403
00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:31.465
from, we'll be overwhelmed.

404
00:21:33.305 --> 00:21:35.085
If that's true, the enemy is always

405
00:21:35.095 --> 00:21:37.805
after us constantly trying to destroy us.

406
00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:40.765
That means there is this spiritual war happening,

407
00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:42.565
the spiritual battle behind the scenes.

408
00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:45.725
We can't see, if we just caught a glimpse of it,

409
00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:46.965
we would be overwhelmed

410
00:21:48.965 --> 00:21:51.655
because God is protecting us from so

411
00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:53.285
Much.

412
00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:58.495
And so I know I've, I say this all the time,

413
00:21:58.515 --> 00:22:00.135
it seems like, but we might not,

414
00:22:00.775 --> 00:22:02.775
probably won't understand what's happening

415
00:22:02.775 --> 00:22:03.975
to us in the moment.

416
00:22:06.605 --> 00:22:08.815
Like Why? Why did this happen?

417
00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.745
God? And we try to figure it out.

418
00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:12.745
We have all these thoughts

419
00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:15.505
and we, we might not even for a while be able

420
00:22:15.505 --> 00:22:16.625
to understand why.

421
00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.625
And maybe not at all in our lives.

422
00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:20.585
Well, we understand why this happened

423
00:22:20.585 --> 00:22:22.625
or what's going on with this situation.

424
00:22:24.565 --> 00:22:28.975
But what we know is that everything that comes our way

425
00:22:30.435 --> 00:22:32.415
is filtered through the hands of

426
00:22:32.475 --> 00:22:33.475
God.

427
00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:36.615
We might not think it's good in the moment.

428
00:22:36.635 --> 00:22:39.095
We might not have a picture of how God could use this

429
00:22:39.095 --> 00:22:41.295
for his glory, but it is filtered.

430
00:22:41.915 --> 00:22:43.615
He is protecting.

431
00:22:43.715 --> 00:22:46.095
He has us surrounded

432
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:49.935
and he is the king reigning every day of our lives.

433
00:22:50.365 --> 00:22:52.375
There's never a moment He's out of control.

434
00:22:53.925 --> 00:22:55.855
There's never a moment. He's surprised.

435
00:22:58.245 --> 00:23:00.975
There's never a moment where he has to rethink his plan

436
00:23:01.555 --> 00:23:02.935
and come up with a new option.

437
00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:10.435
And he daily, that's what it says, daily bears us up

438
00:23:11.335 --> 00:23:12.675
as our God of salvation.

439
00:23:16.665 --> 00:23:19.175
Again, though, that's not all

440
00:23:21.945 --> 00:23:25.145
I did make an extra divide here in the Psalm at verse 21,

441
00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:26.505
the Sayah came in verse 19,

442
00:23:27.085 --> 00:23:29.305
but look at the first couple words of verse 21.

443
00:23:31.005 --> 00:23:34.065
But God will strike the heads of his enemies.

444
00:23:36.045 --> 00:23:39.635
Verse 22, the Lord said, I will bring them back.

445
00:23:41.035 --> 00:23:42.755
I will bring them back.

446
00:23:42.815 --> 00:23:46.605
And it it turns from 19 and 20, which is present.

447
00:23:46.905 --> 00:23:50.265
It turns future. It's future tense, right?

448
00:23:52.135 --> 00:23:53.665
He's beginning to look forward.

449
00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.625
And so that's why the point here is

450
00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:58.745
that God will prove his reign not only in Israel's history,

451
00:23:59.045 --> 00:24:00.665
not only daily for his people,

452
00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:05.505
but God will also prove his reign from glory to glory.

453
00:24:07.975 --> 00:24:11.265
That phrase, glory to glory is used all over about the

454
00:24:11.265 --> 00:24:12.625
future, about eternity.

455
00:24:14.605 --> 00:24:17.745
And so he's talking future. God will do this.

456
00:24:17.805 --> 00:24:20.705
God will do this. So he's seen past, he's seen present

457
00:24:20.805 --> 00:24:23.145
and he's going to see future.

458
00:24:23.365 --> 00:24:25.985
In fact, verse 24 talks about a procession

459
00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:27.625
into the sanctuary.

460
00:24:27.915 --> 00:24:30.265
Could have been when David brought God's arc

461
00:24:30.265 --> 00:24:32.025
of the covenant into the tabernacle.

462
00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:34.505
It could have been when Solomon came into the temple

463
00:24:34.705 --> 00:24:35.785
a few years later.

464
00:24:36.845 --> 00:24:41.065
But look carefully, verse 24 says, the procession

465
00:24:41.405 --> 00:24:45.195
of my God, my king

466
00:24:46.145 --> 00:24:47.195
into the sanctuary.

467
00:24:49.025 --> 00:24:51.955
He's talking about when the Lord dwells in his house,

468
00:24:54.575 --> 00:24:56.035
that's a future ring to it,

469
00:24:57.925 --> 00:25:02.675
which culminates in verse 31 when all the nations will come.

470
00:25:04.445 --> 00:25:07.905
So there's a measure of future idea, plus you have the fact.

471
00:25:07.905 --> 00:25:09.625
This section leads into the last section.

472
00:25:09.725 --> 00:25:12.625
We looked at it earlier, starting in verse 32, which seems

473
00:25:12.625 --> 00:25:15.985
to be universal 'cause verse 32 says, oh, kingdoms

474
00:25:15.985 --> 00:25:17.265
of the earth sing to God.

475
00:25:17.365 --> 00:25:22.225
So there's a picture of eternity where all the nations,

476
00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:25.905
not just Israel, not just David and Solomon

477
00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:30.145
and that whole thing, all the nations, all the kingdoms.

478
00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:36.655
Verse 34, remember he's majestic over Israel.

479
00:25:36.715 --> 00:25:39.735
Yes, but his power is in the skies.

480
00:25:40.635 --> 00:25:44.575
He is awesome from his sanctuary, which alludes

481
00:25:44.575 --> 00:25:45.575
to it being in the sky.

482
00:25:45.635 --> 00:25:48.735
So this is a picture of him in eternity,

483
00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.955
Not just in a location in Jerusalem,

484
00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:57.675
but in the throne sanctuary of eternity.

485
00:26:01.675 --> 00:26:05.455
In fact, that's what we see at the end of Revelation

486
00:26:06.325 --> 00:26:09.175
chapter 21, verses 22 through 26.

487
00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:10.855
This is talking about the new heavens and new earth.

488
00:26:10.855 --> 00:26:15.375
Listen to this, John saw no temple in that city

489
00:26:15.715 --> 00:26:18.975
for its temple is the Lord God, the almighty

490
00:26:18.975 --> 00:26:20.855
and the lamb dwelling place.

491
00:26:21.675 --> 00:26:24.615
And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it.

492
00:26:24.615 --> 00:26:28.295
For the glory of God gives it light. Its lamp is the lamb.

493
00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:31.775
By its light will the nations walk.

494
00:26:31.995 --> 00:26:34.375
The kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.

495
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:37.535
Its gates will never be shut by day, there'll be no night.

496
00:26:37.845 --> 00:26:39.535
They will bring into it the glory

497
00:26:39.675 --> 00:26:41.495
and the honor of the nations.

498
00:26:41.805 --> 00:26:44.050
Does that not sound like Psalm 68?

499
00:26:46.965 --> 00:26:48.585
You see the similarities where that,

500
00:26:48.655 --> 00:26:51.545
that the other nations are gonna stretch their hands out

501
00:26:51.565 --> 00:26:54.625
to God, the kingdoms of the earth, but sing praises to God.

502
00:26:54.885 --> 00:26:58.945
His power is in the skies. His awesome from his sanctuary.

503
00:26:58.945 --> 00:27:01.545
What this is saying to us is that he rules

504
00:27:01.885 --> 00:27:03.745
and reigns from glory to glory.

505
00:27:05.535 --> 00:27:07.265
He's reigned in the past. He reigns in the present,

506
00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:10.065
and he reigns from glory to glory forever and ever.

507
00:27:10.575 --> 00:27:12.025
Amen. Now, we could be done right

508
00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:15.025
there And just by the look of you.

509
00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:16.345
Some of you already are, okay?

510
00:27:21.005 --> 00:27:23.105
But the problem is with our desire

511
00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:27.065
to interpret the Bible faithfully

512
00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:30.585
and to teach how to interpret the Bible faithfully.

513
00:27:32.345 --> 00:27:34.315
This is a place where if we stopped right

514
00:27:34.315 --> 00:27:35.355
there, we would miss something.

515
00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:38.335
We, we've looked at the Psalm

516
00:27:38.335 --> 00:27:39.775
and we could say, yeah, that's an accurate

517
00:27:39.775 --> 00:27:40.935
presentation of the Psalm.

518
00:27:40.935 --> 00:27:43.935
All of that, nothing's wrong with what I've said.

519
00:27:44.035 --> 00:27:49.015
I'm not limiting. But one tool in our tool belt

520
00:27:50.155 --> 00:27:52.895
is that we must interpret scripture with scripture,

521
00:27:55.185 --> 00:27:56.615
especially ask the question,

522
00:27:57.005 --> 00:27:59.215
does the New Testament say anything about

523
00:27:59.485 --> 00:28:00.975
what we're reading here in the Old Testament?

524
00:28:02.315 --> 00:28:04.665
Right? So this stands on its own. It's great, it's powerful.

525
00:28:04.685 --> 00:28:06.425
We could preach that we're good.

526
00:28:08.485 --> 00:28:12.305
In fact, the New Testament very clearly does in this case,

527
00:28:12.405 --> 00:28:14.585
say something about what we've just read.

528
00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:16.545
So turn with me now over to

529
00:28:17.175 --> 00:28:21.145
Ephesians chapter four, all the way in the New Testament.

530
00:28:21.175 --> 00:28:25.665
Ephesians chapter four, we're gonna see

531
00:28:25.685 --> 00:28:28.465
how the Apostle Paul interpreted this psalm.

532
00:28:29.365 --> 00:28:30.425
Always a good practice.

533
00:28:30.425 --> 00:28:31.945
Look at how the New Testament uses it.

534
00:28:32.045 --> 00:28:35.745
He wrote to the Ephesians, this letter, here's

535
00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:38.825
what we're gonna add To all that we've seen.

536
00:28:38.825 --> 00:28:41.625
That's good and right, God's reign in the past, present,

537
00:28:41.625 --> 00:28:44.785
future, accurate, faithful, yes.

538
00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:49.245
But what we're gonna add to that, what we've already seen,

539
00:28:49.835 --> 00:28:52.725
what we're gonna add in verse in in Ephesians four,

540
00:28:53.255 --> 00:28:58.125
we're gonna see is that Psalm 68 not only shows us of

541
00:28:58.125 --> 00:28:59.445
what God's reign is

542
00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:03.765
and is like, we're also gonna see that it points us

543
00:29:04.385 --> 00:29:05.605
to Christ's victory.

544
00:29:07.555 --> 00:29:10.105
Psalm 68 is actually pointing us forward

545
00:29:10.925 --> 00:29:12.745
to Christ's victory.

546
00:29:15.305 --> 00:29:19.345
'cause in Ephesians four, in the context of Christian unity,

547
00:29:19.575 --> 00:29:21.185
look at verses seven through 10.

548
00:29:24.525 --> 00:29:26.865
But grace was given to each one of us according

549
00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:28.625
to the measure of Christ's gift.

550
00:29:29.775 --> 00:29:33.625
Therefore, it says, when he ascended on high,

551
00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.865
he led a host of captives

552
00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:38.385
and he gave gifts to men

553
00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:42.505
in saying he ascended, what does it mean?

554
00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:44.425
But that he had also descended into

555
00:29:44.425 --> 00:29:45.505
the lower regions the earth.

556
00:29:46.325 --> 00:29:49.785
He who descended is the one who also ascended far

557
00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:53.065
above all the heavens that he might fill all things.

558
00:29:55.165 --> 00:29:56.345
So do you see what Paul just did?

559
00:29:58.465 --> 00:30:01.245
He took the crux of Psalm 68.

560
00:30:04.225 --> 00:30:08.325
He took the basic measure and he applied it to Christ.

561
00:30:10.105 --> 00:30:11.885
He tweaked the quote a little bit,

562
00:30:13.225 --> 00:30:15.885
but as the Holy Spirit was leading him to write this letter

563
00:30:15.885 --> 00:30:18.525
to the Ephesians that we now know his scripture, he he,

564
00:30:18.865 --> 00:30:21.725
it led him to this interpretation that

565
00:30:21.795 --> 00:30:23.685
what happened in Christ

566
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:29.065
Was far greater than what happened in Psalm 68.

567
00:30:32.365 --> 00:30:34.055
That Psalm 68, what happened?

568
00:30:34.055 --> 00:30:37.095
There was a prophecy of something greater to come

569
00:30:37.915 --> 00:30:39.055
in the Messiah.

570
00:30:42.245 --> 00:30:44.145
What's he talking about? What's greater about

571
00:30:44.255 --> 00:30:47.265
what Jesus did than what happened in Jerusalem?

572
00:30:47.335 --> 00:30:49.865
Well, first he says there's a greater,

573
00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:52.065
there's a far greater ascension here.

574
00:30:54.305 --> 00:30:57.715
What I'm talking about with Christ's a far greater ascension

575
00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:01.235
than what happened back then.

576
00:31:03.145 --> 00:31:04.625
'cause remember back in Psalm 68,

577
00:31:05.395 --> 00:31:09.385
God's faithfulness hits a climax in his ascent

578
00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:11.265
to Mount Zion in Jerusalem.

579
00:31:12.175 --> 00:31:15.825
That was the whole progress from Egypt to Jerusalem, that

580
00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:18.585
that was God entering his dwelling place.

581
00:31:18.615 --> 00:31:20.025
That was the peak.

582
00:31:20.925 --> 00:31:23.145
And now what that did is it held promise for their future.

583
00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:26.465
The present saying God's gonna deliver us from our enemies.

584
00:31:26.555 --> 00:31:29.545
God's gonna rescue us. God's gonna receive worship here at

585
00:31:29.545 --> 00:31:30.985
this location in Jerusalem.

586
00:31:31.135 --> 00:31:33.065
That was what it pointed back to.

587
00:31:33.085 --> 00:31:35.625
But what Paul does here in Psalm, in Ephesians four,

588
00:31:37.925 --> 00:31:42.545
is he sees Christ's ascension to the the Mount Zion

589
00:31:42.605 --> 00:31:46.305
of God's right hand as a far greater ascension than

590
00:31:46.305 --> 00:31:47.305
what happened in Jerusalem.

591
00:31:50.225 --> 00:31:54.405
The greater triumph, the greater promise that all,

592
00:31:55.665 --> 00:31:59.965
not just all of the opposing nations in the land, all

593
00:31:59.965 --> 00:32:03.645
of the cosmic forces of evil standing against

594
00:32:04.175 --> 00:32:06.925
God's people were defeated in the life, death,

595
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:10.645
and resurrection of Jesus, which he proved by ascending back

596
00:32:10.645 --> 00:32:14.285
to the throne of God That yes,

597
00:32:14.785 --> 00:32:15.845
all those people needed

598
00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:17.565
to be removed from the PO promised land.

599
00:32:17.595 --> 00:32:19.245
Okay? And God ascends to Jerusalem.

600
00:32:19.345 --> 00:32:21.285
I'm reigning from there, but Jesus says,

601
00:32:21.305 --> 00:32:22.725
I'm taking all the enemies of God.

602
00:32:23.025 --> 00:32:24.285
I'm putting them under my feet

603
00:32:24.305 --> 00:32:26.765
and I'm ascending to that throne.

604
00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.765
'cause Paul's already written about this in Ephesians,

605
00:32:28.915 --> 00:32:30.045
just listen to this.

606
00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:32.205
Ephesians one says,

607
00:32:32.465 --> 00:32:34.725
he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead,

608
00:32:34.745 --> 00:32:38.325
seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far

609
00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:40.085
above all rule and authority and power

610
00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:41.885
and dominion above every name

611
00:32:41.885 --> 00:32:43.525
that is named not only in this age,

612
00:32:43.545 --> 00:32:44.725
but also in the one to come.

613
00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:46.405
He put all things under his feet,

614
00:32:46.555 --> 00:32:48.645
gave him his head over all things to the church,

615
00:32:48.735 --> 00:32:49.765
which is his body.

616
00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:54.005
The fullness of Him who fills all in all chapter two,

617
00:32:54.595 --> 00:32:56.685
even when we were dead in our trespasses,

618
00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:59.125
made us alive together with Christ by grace.

619
00:32:59.125 --> 00:33:01.765
You've been saved and raised us up with him

620
00:33:01.985 --> 00:33:03.845
and seeded us with him in the heavenly

621
00:33:03.845 --> 00:33:05.565
places in Christ Jesus.

622
00:33:06.515 --> 00:33:09.325
Chapter three. So that through the church,

623
00:33:09.465 --> 00:33:12.525
the manifold wisdom of God might be now made known

624
00:33:12.545 --> 00:33:15.525
to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.

625
00:33:16.985 --> 00:33:20.445
So what Paul says is that Christ ascending to the throne

626
00:33:20.545 --> 00:33:22.005
of God is proof

627
00:33:23.035 --> 00:33:25.605
that he's triumphed over his enemies

628
00:33:26.115 --> 00:33:27.725
over all the worldly powers

629
00:33:27.915 --> 00:33:29.205
that could ever come against him.

630
00:33:31.255 --> 00:33:34.505
Yeah, the ascension of the tabernacle to the

631
00:33:35.035 --> 00:33:37.865
Mount Zion in Jerusalem was proof that God won.

632
00:33:38.045 --> 00:33:41.105
Yes, but this, this,

633
00:33:41.975 --> 00:33:44.065
this is a far greater ascension.

634
00:33:44.205 --> 00:33:49.145
Is that not good news for us church, that God the Son,

635
00:33:49.285 --> 00:33:51.985
it says here, Ephesians four, God, the Son descended

636
00:33:51.985 --> 00:33:54.425
to the lower regions, the earth to be with us,

637
00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:58.905
to take on flesh so that

638
00:33:59.485 --> 00:34:02.305
he might defeat every other worldly

639
00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:06.625
power and he's done it.

640
00:34:08.195 --> 00:34:11.905
Colossians two 15, he's disarmed the rulers and authorities

641
00:34:11.905 --> 00:34:16.185
and put them to open shame by triumphing over them in him,

642
00:34:17.445 --> 00:34:18.825
the victory's been won.

643
00:34:21.365 --> 00:34:23.425
And church, listen that that means we can walk in

644
00:34:23.425 --> 00:34:24.865
hope because of that.

645
00:34:26.435 --> 00:34:28.905
There is a hope that we can have.

646
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:31.985
We can walk in victory because of this.

647
00:34:31.985 --> 00:34:35.465
Listen, if you're in Christ, Ephesians said, you're seated

648
00:34:35.465 --> 00:34:40.265
with him already in the heavenly places, far

649
00:34:40.275 --> 00:34:43.185
above all of those other things that come against us.

650
00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:47.865
Lemme just think about that in his ascension.

651
00:34:48.765 --> 00:34:53.505
We have ascended in his overcoming

652
00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:58.305
we can overcome in his victory.

653
00:34:59.605 --> 00:35:00.605
We have victory.

654
00:35:01.615 --> 00:35:04.945
Like let's Just walk in that every day church.

655
00:35:08.465 --> 00:35:10.765
But there's something else in Ephesians four, we can't miss.

656
00:35:12.975 --> 00:35:16.195
See, what we normally think of a king doing

657
00:35:17.735 --> 00:35:19.315
is merely receiving gifts

658
00:35:21.805 --> 00:35:24.215
that the king is the center of everything

659
00:35:25.005 --> 00:35:27.425
and all of it revolves to honor the king.

660
00:35:29.775 --> 00:35:33.435
That's kind of what Psalm 68 indicated that

661
00:35:33.495 --> 00:35:36.555
as the king ascended to Mount Zion, everything was supposed

662
00:35:36.555 --> 00:35:39.605
to give, give, give to the king,

663
00:35:42.715 --> 00:35:45.135
but the king of the universe doesn't need anything.

664
00:35:47.535 --> 00:35:49.595
In fact, he's a good

665
00:35:49.595 --> 00:35:53.715
and gracious king who instead gives us gifts.

666
00:35:59.485 --> 00:36:03.295
This was the major tweak that Paul made from Psalm 68

667
00:36:03.295 --> 00:36:06.935
to Ephesians chapter four, where in Ephesians four he said,

668
00:36:06.935 --> 00:36:08.895
grace was given to each one of us according

669
00:36:08.895 --> 00:36:10.375
to the measure of Christ's gift.

670
00:36:10.375 --> 00:36:13.895
Therefore, it says, when he ascended on high, he led a host

671
00:36:13.895 --> 00:36:16.695
of captives and he gave gifts to men.

672
00:36:17.955 --> 00:36:21.095
In Psalm 68, it says, he received gifts. Here it says no.

673
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:24.855
He actually gave gifts instead of demanding gifts.

674
00:36:24.955 --> 00:36:28.815
The good and gracious king gives gifts, not just land,

675
00:36:29.155 --> 00:36:30.535
not just food, not just

676
00:36:30.535 --> 00:36:32.055
protection, which are all good things.

677
00:36:32.155 --> 00:36:34.455
No, this is the context of Ephesians four.

678
00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:36.055
He's saying, I'm giving you things

679
00:36:36.055 --> 00:36:38.695
that will give you unity within the church.

680
00:36:38.695 --> 00:36:41.335
That's what his gifts are, for which he continues.

681
00:36:41.335 --> 00:36:44.495
In verse 11, he gave the apostles, prophets, evangelists,

682
00:36:44.615 --> 00:36:47.535
shepherds, and teachers to equip the saints for the work

683
00:36:47.535 --> 00:36:49.775
of ministry, for building up the body of Christ

684
00:36:49.945 --> 00:36:53.375
until we all attain to the unity of the faith, the knowledge

685
00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:56.415
of the Son of God, mature manhood to the measure of stature,

686
00:36:56.415 --> 00:36:58.255
of the fullness of Christ, so

687
00:36:58.255 --> 00:37:01.495
that we may no longer be children tossed to

688
00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:04.135
and fro by the waves carried about by every wind

689
00:37:04.135 --> 00:37:06.295
of doctrine, by human cunning, craftiness,

690
00:37:06.295 --> 00:37:07.295
and deceitful schemes.

691
00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:09.535
Rather speaking the truth in love.

692
00:37:09.595 --> 00:37:11.735
We are to grow up in every way into him

693
00:37:11.735 --> 00:37:15.535
who is the head into Christ, from whom the whole body joined

694
00:37:15.535 --> 00:37:18.255
and held together by every joint with which it is equipped,

695
00:37:18.685 --> 00:37:22.015
when each part is working properly, makes the body grow

696
00:37:22.075 --> 00:37:24.095
so it builds itself up in love.

697
00:37:26.355 --> 00:37:30.405
So tie all this together as Christ

698
00:37:31.405 --> 00:37:33.365
defeated the worldly powers

699
00:37:35.285 --> 00:37:39.345
and from his lofty, newly won position

700
00:37:39.725 --> 00:37:41.865
of Mount Zion at God's right hand,

701
00:37:43.885 --> 00:37:46.345
he distributed gifts to God's people,

702
00:37:49.315 --> 00:37:51.385
gifts that would foster unity, gifts

703
00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:54.505
that would enable his people to become the mature man

704
00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.225
that God created humanity to be,

705
00:37:58.455 --> 00:38:00.355
to help us grow up.

706
00:38:00.655 --> 00:38:02.515
He gave us gifts. And so listen, what

707
00:38:02.515 --> 00:38:06.395
that means just basically is that we need you.

708
00:38:07.995 --> 00:38:10.395
I need you. We need each other

709
00:38:11.745 --> 00:38:15.355
that we cannot grow up into the maturity God wants us

710
00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:17.955
to grow up into without each other,

711
00:38:20.275 --> 00:38:22.925
without serving one another with the gifts he's given us.

712
00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:25.965
So find yours. Find your place, serve

713
00:38:25.965 --> 00:38:29.365
because I need you and you need each other.

714
00:38:33.165 --> 00:38:38.025
Yet the greatest gift of all far

715
00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:41.385
above teaching or mercy or service

716
00:38:41.565 --> 00:38:45.345
or whatever gift that you have, far above any

717
00:38:45.445 --> 00:38:48.745
of those things, the greatest gift is the one

718
00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:50.625
that Peter preached about in Acts 2 38.

719
00:38:50.925 --> 00:38:53.385
The gift of the Holy Spirit,

720
00:38:57.795 --> 00:39:01.655
the gift that Acts 2 33 says Jesus, from that throne

721
00:39:02.075 --> 00:39:05.175
of heaven poured out on his people.

722
00:39:07.215 --> 00:39:09.195
So again, we're tying all this together.

723
00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:13.195
The king ascended to the throne, victorious ruling,

724
00:39:13.335 --> 00:39:15.435
and he starts to give gifts.

725
00:39:15.745 --> 00:39:18.235
This is the main gift

726
00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:22.675
that he taught about John 14, that he's gonna leave

727
00:39:23.615 --> 00:39:26.315
and he's gonna send his Holy Spirit to those

728
00:39:26.315 --> 00:39:27.515
who repent and believe.

729
00:39:27.515 --> 00:39:28.995
That's how we are led.

730
00:39:29.015 --> 00:39:31.275
Romans eight says, that's how we are gifted.

731
00:39:31.275 --> 00:39:33.355
First Corinthians 12 says, that's

732
00:39:33.355 --> 00:39:35.875
how we are changed in our character.

733
00:39:35.875 --> 00:39:39.275
Galatians five says, God said, I'm gonna send my spirit,

734
00:39:40.245 --> 00:39:43.275
which by the way, didn't happen in Psalm 68.

735
00:39:45.055 --> 00:39:47.075
That's the difference. The Old Testament believers did not

736
00:39:47.075 --> 00:39:49.875
have the Holy Spirit permanently inside them.

737
00:39:50.405 --> 00:39:53.195
God's presence was dwelling in Jerusalem.

738
00:39:53.535 --> 00:39:57.115
But now God's presence is dwelling inside of us

739
00:39:57.115 --> 00:40:00.395
because what Psalm 68 does points us to Christ's victory.

740
00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:04.155
He's the risen king, the risen, ascended Lord, overall,

741
00:40:04.295 --> 00:40:06.955
giving gifts to everyone.

742
00:40:06.955 --> 00:40:09.555
Every good and perfect gift to us that we need

743
00:40:09.935 --> 00:40:11.035
for life and godliness.

744
00:40:11.035 --> 00:40:14.795
He has given especially, especially the Holy Spirit.

745
00:40:17.755 --> 00:40:18.975
That's the difference here.

746
00:40:19.675 --> 00:40:23.575
That's how Paul in Psal in Ephesians four can take Psalm 68

747
00:40:23.595 --> 00:40:25.415
and say, yes, that is right.

748
00:40:25.445 --> 00:40:29.455
It's good, but here's how it really points us to the Lord.

749
00:40:30.195 --> 00:40:31.455
Here's what it really means.

750
00:40:32.675 --> 00:40:36.245
It means God's given us the gift,

751
00:40:37.425 --> 00:40:40.925
the Holy Spirit that we need desperately.

752
00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:42.485
That's how much this matters.

753
00:40:42.605 --> 00:40:44.725
I know Psalm 68, you go home and read the whole thing later

754
00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:45.805
and you're gonna be so confused.

755
00:40:45.945 --> 00:40:49.685
I'm confused use. But this is how it matters

756
00:40:52.545 --> 00:40:56.435
that our risen, triumphant, ascended king has granted

757
00:40:56.615 --> 00:41:00.475
to us all things necessary for life and godliness forever.

758
00:41:03.945 --> 00:41:05.365
That's how we can have confidence.

759
00:41:05.365 --> 00:41:08.485
That's how we can have hope as we live out this life,

760
00:41:08.585 --> 00:41:10.045
as we lean on him.

761
00:41:10.045 --> 00:41:12.005
Listen, it's okay to be needy.

762
00:41:13.615 --> 00:41:15.235
He created us to need him.

763
00:41:18.455 --> 00:41:19.835
But hear this today,

764
00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:21.835
he has also given you everything you need.

765
00:41:23.285 --> 00:41:24.535
He's given me everything I need.

766
00:41:27.095 --> 00:41:31.555
So as needy as we are, we lean on him and we have enough.
