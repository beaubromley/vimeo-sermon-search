1
00:00:01.025 --> 00:00:04.085
The one who is the true light, who gives light

2
00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:06.125
to everyone was coming into the world.

3
00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:28.155
He was in the world and the world was made through him.

4
00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:30.115
But who was this light?

5
00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:37.755
He was and is God with us?

6
00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.415
Well, it's great to see you church as we inch closer

7
00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.135
to Christmas, uh, kids just 10 more sleeps.

8
00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.095
So just know that's coming soon.

9
00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:51.815
Uh, but it is great to be together. My name is John.

10
00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:53.575
If I haven't met you yet, I'm one of the pastors here.

11
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.455
I get to preach most of the time. It's an honor to do that.

12
00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:56.975
Uh, we'd love to meet you.

13
00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:58.735
If you are new, please come say hello

14
00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:00.575
to us up here at the front afterwards

15
00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:02.975
or at the new here area out there in the lobby.

16
00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:06.495
Uh, but today we're continuing celebrating Christmas

17
00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.295
as leading up to that this series.

18
00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:09.855
We're calling God with us,

19
00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:12.415
that word e Emmanuel in the Bible.

20
00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:16.135
As we lead up to the celebration of

21
00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:19.335
that in full on Christmas Eve, we're building up to it

22
00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:21.135
as we go, which by the way, lemme remind you quickly

23
00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:22.215
about Christmas Eve.

24
00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.095
It's coming up on next Tuesday, the 24th.

25
00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:28.135
Of course, it's three services here on that day,

26
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:30.335
2, 3 30 and five o'clock.

27
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.055
Uh, if you, generally the two o'clock's the most attended.

28
00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:36.975
So if you can go towards the last two, that would be great.

29
00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:39.815
Uh, but just so you know, that's coming up also no community

30
00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:41.135
groups the next two Sundays.

31
00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:45.055
So just as you prepare to come those Sundays, uh, just know

32
00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:46.095
that's on the website

33
00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:47.655
as well if you need to find it in the future.

34
00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:52.975
But what we began last Sunday as we, uh, began this journey,

35
00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:56.175
it was a journey through John chapter one.

36
00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:59.215
And so if you don't have it already open, let me invite you

37
00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:01.775
to take your copy of God's word and turn there with me.

38
00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:05.295
John chapter one will also be in there next week.

39
00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:08.855
So leave a bookmark there to finish this little section.

40
00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:12.535
We kicked it off with verses one through five.

41
00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:15.415
That was the introduction of John one,

42
00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:20.255
where we dug deep theologically into what that word means.

43
00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:21.975
The word that it talks about

44
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:24.895
and who it was, it was God, the Son, Jesus.

45
00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:27.935
And so that he came

46
00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:30.695
to give us life was the whole point of that last week.

47
00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:35.035
Well, today we're gonna continue in verses six through 13

48
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:38.595
by looking at how Emmanuel God with us, how he brings

49
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.675
light this time.

50
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:42.635
Which by the way, if you haven't noticed,

51
00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.475
we got new lights this week in the room.

52
00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:47.915
So, uh, that's part of adjusting, learning, all of that.

53
00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:50.315
We don't have heat, but we got new lights. So there you go.

54
00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:54.155
Alright. Uh, as we get into it today, I was, I was walking

55
00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.795
through my bedroom at some point early

56
00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:58.475
morning this week sometime.

57
00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:00.405
And just this thought flash into my head

58
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:01.965
and it relates really well to

59
00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:03.845
what we're gonna talk about today.

60
00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:05.005
And so I want you to start

61
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.725
by just thinking about your bedroom.

62
00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:09.485
So you, you've got it in your head, right?

63
00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:13.525
Like this is your Wait, is that not your bed? No. Okay.

64
00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:16.085
Um, anyway, maybe it's more like this. Okay.

65
00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:19.285
This is probably more likely what it is. Okay.

66
00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:21.565
Well just think about your bedroom, right?

67
00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:23.285
You, you know, whether it's that or something else.

68
00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:25.725
Maybe it is your first picture. Okay, fine.

69
00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:27.685
But whatever your bedroom looks like,

70
00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:28.885
you know what it is, right?

71
00:03:28.885 --> 00:03:30.005
So you've got it in your head

72
00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:33.245
and you know it really where, where the, the desk is

73
00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:35.125
that the, the chairs in the corner,

74
00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:37.565
the Legos are scattered on the floor over here.

75
00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:40.245
Clothes are in the watered up in the, like,

76
00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:42.845
you know your room as you think about it in your head.

77
00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:45.205
Here's what I came to realize though as I was walking

78
00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:46.765
through my room.

79
00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:49.685
It it, I walk a whole lot faster

80
00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:53.085
through my room when the light's on compared

81
00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:55.245
to when it's dark, right?

82
00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:57.635
And you're like, of course. But

83
00:03:57.635 --> 00:03:58.795
just think about that for a second.

84
00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:02.875
I know my room really well. You know your room really well.

85
00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:05.675
Like you could even picture it and place it in your head.

86
00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:09.795
But when the light's off, you still walk slower

87
00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:11.995
because you're not real sure how far away

88
00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:15.475
that thing you're gonna stub your toe on actually is.

89
00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:16.955
So you end up walking through your room

90
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:18.195
kinda like a zombie in some way.

91
00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:20.715
Like you just sort of through trying to feel

92
00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:22.755
where you know the desk is.

93
00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:26.115
But you can't walk like you do when you walk through it

94
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:27.355
with the light on.

95
00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:31.925
Now it's not an exact one-to-one correlation of course,

96
00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:34.765
but what we get from John one six

97
00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:36.645
through 13 is a similar idea

98
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:41.315
that not only does God bring life, this God

99
00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:44.235
with us Emmanuel idea brings light

100
00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:47.075
and light that overcomes the darkness

101
00:04:49.215 --> 00:04:52.385
both in the world and in our lives.

102
00:04:54.515 --> 00:04:56.855
So take a look at verses six through 13 with me.

103
00:04:56.855 --> 00:04:59.695
Now follow along as I read this with that idea.

104
00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:04.275
Verse six. There was a man sent from God

105
00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:05.515
whose name was John.

106
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:09.035
He came as a witness to bear witness about the light

107
00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:10.875
that all might believe through him.

108
00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:13.275
He was not the light

109
00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:15.875
but came to bear witness about the light,

110
00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.635
the true light which gives light

111
00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.395
to everyone was coming into the world.

112
00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:23.745
He was in the world and the world was made through him.

113
00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.705
Yet the world did not know him.

114
00:05:27.205 --> 00:05:30.665
He came to his own and his own people did not receive him.

115
00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:36.265
But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name,

116
00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:39.465
he gave the right to become children of God

117
00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:43.795
who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,

118
00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:47.635
nor of the will of man, but born of God.

119
00:05:49.605 --> 00:05:50.935
Lord, thank you for this word.

120
00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:55.255
Thank you that you have inspired 2000 years ago, John

121
00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:57.055
to write this so

122
00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.965
that we would know you better even today.

123
00:06:02.415 --> 00:06:04.915
But Holy Spirit, we need you to illuminate this,

124
00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:06.355
to give us understanding

125
00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:11.155
and an application to know what you want of us from us,

126
00:06:11.895 --> 00:06:14.545
for us, for your glory.

127
00:06:15.365 --> 00:06:17.065
So help us today to see it

128
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:21.905
and know all of that with your eyes in our hearts

129
00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:24.265
to see and understand it in Jesus' name.

130
00:06:25.095 --> 00:06:28.855
Amen. So last week we had

131
00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.095
to figure out who the word was.

132
00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:32.735
Well this week we gotta figure out who this light is.

133
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.455
'cause the light seems to be acting.

134
00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.375
And so we gotta know who that is.

135
00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:40.255
And so specifically we know this light

136
00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:41.895
was bringing salvation.

137
00:06:42.775 --> 00:06:44.715
So the only one who can save is God himself.

138
00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:48.155
And so we know already the light is associated

139
00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:49.755
with is God,

140
00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:52.875
which is why we capitalize the word light on your notes

141
00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:54.795
because we're talking about something more

142
00:06:54.795 --> 00:06:55.915
than just physical lights.

143
00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:58.275
We're talking about the light.

144
00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:02.435
'cause here what it's referring to is God the Son

145
00:07:02.435 --> 00:07:04.315
that Messiah, that God

146
00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:06.995
with us figure the word from last week.

147
00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:10.755
Now is the light in this section. Jesus the Messiah.

148
00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:14.825
So what verses one through five is it,

149
00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:19.625
it showed us this ancient story of the origin of the word,

150
00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:20.905
which we know there was no origin.

151
00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:23.905
He always existed but, but that was the ancient story.

152
00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:27.505
Now this section is the buildup to

153
00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:29.865
that light giving savior showing up on the scene

154
00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:33.235
crosses over a little bit to actually being here.

155
00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:36.835
But what you see right away is the beginnings of

156
00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:39.235
what we know as the Christmas story,

157
00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:41.995
which we find in Luke two, Matthew one.

158
00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.035
You find that elsewhere.

159
00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:46.155
But, but what we know as the traditional major scene, all

160
00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:47.955
that stuff, here's why it happened

161
00:07:47.955 --> 00:07:52.835
and here's the buildup to it, which is first what God did

162
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:55.915
by sending witnesses about the light.

163
00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:59.275
That's what we see here right away is that God sent

164
00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:02.395
witnesses about the light to begin with.

165
00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:07.875
This was coming. He needed to send a witness to declare it.

166
00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:13.175
And so in first six we see the Apostle John

167
00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:15.575
who's writing this, describe

168
00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.015
the ministry of John the Baptist.

169
00:08:17.275 --> 00:08:19.215
Now you knew those were different guys, right?

170
00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:21.175
There's more than one John in the Bible.

171
00:08:21.445 --> 00:08:24.895
John the Baptist, John the Apostle who wrote this,

172
00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:27.535
John the Apostle, one of the disciples of Jesus, the 12,

173
00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:30.495
like John the Apostle wrote this account of Jesus

174
00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:32.535
and he's referring to John the Baptist

175
00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:34.615
who was this eccentric guy

176
00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:36.295
who ate locusts and honey in the desert.

177
00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:39.195
Okay? So those are different people.

178
00:08:40.015 --> 00:08:42.915
But John the Baptist was not somebody who'd just gone mad

179
00:08:42.915 --> 00:08:44.115
and ended up in the wilderness.

180
00:08:44.255 --> 00:08:46.475
No. He was in fact a fulfillment

181
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:51.315
of the prophecies from 400 years earlier in Malachi three

182
00:08:51.655 --> 00:08:56.165
and 700 years earlier in Isaiah chapter 40.

183
00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.485
Both of those said

184
00:08:58.715 --> 00:09:02.085
that a figure like the Old Testament prophet Elijah,

185
00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:04.525
was coming before the Messiah showed up.

186
00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:07.895
Somebody like Elijah was gonna show up on the scene

187
00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:10.415
that all would believe, that all would hear

188
00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:12.935
and understand that's the point that that they needed

189
00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:16.095
to repent and prepare the way for the Messiah to come.

190
00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:20.525
So they're predicting 700, 400 years earlier

191
00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:22.805
somebody like Elijah,

192
00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:25.485
and that's what John the Baptist came to do.

193
00:09:26.985 --> 00:09:28.125
Verses six through eight again,

194
00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:29.485
there was a man sent from God.

195
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:33.205
That word sent is like an envoy, an ambassador

196
00:09:33.315 --> 00:09:37.565
between one to another, sent from God whose name was John.

197
00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:40.325
He came as a witness to bear witness about the light

198
00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:41.565
that all might believe through him.

199
00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:43.325
He was not the light, but he came

200
00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:45.325
to bear witness about the light.

201
00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:50.045
His job it says was to point to the savior, which he did.

202
00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:54.205
He beared witness about the light so that all might believe

203
00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:55.485
through the light and through his gospel.

204
00:09:56.775 --> 00:09:57.795
That's what he came to do.

205
00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:02.485
So what we see is God sent witnesses about the light first.

206
00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:04.925
Specifically he sent John the Baptist.

207
00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:09.155
So what this absolutely clearly says, he sent a witness,

208
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:13.155
specifically John the Baptist, to prepare the way

209
00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:15.955
for the Messiah to show up on the scene.

210
00:10:19.175 --> 00:10:20.355
So that's what it says.

211
00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:23.595
But when we try to play to play that out, specifically today

212
00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:24.995
to us, what do we learn?

213
00:10:26.135 --> 00:10:28.395
How do we apply this in some way?

214
00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:33.485
Well, we learn that God has sent you

215
00:10:33.485 --> 00:10:34.685
and me just as much

216
00:10:36.855 --> 00:10:39.915
to be witnesses about the light of Christ.

217
00:10:42.665 --> 00:10:45.365
But it was generally so he spent John the Baptist

218
00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:47.725
specifically, but he sent you

219
00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:51.515
and me generally since none

220
00:10:51.515 --> 00:10:54.595
of us are sitting here 2000 years ago, preparing the way

221
00:10:54.595 --> 00:10:56.035
for the Messiah to come the first time.

222
00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:59.835
That was John's job For us though, it's a general sense

223
00:11:00.015 --> 00:11:04.235
of witnessing about this light because think about it.

224
00:11:04.235 --> 00:11:07.315
Aren't we doing something very similar to

225
00:11:07.315 --> 00:11:10.955
what John was called to do, what he was sent

226
00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:12.155
to do originally?

227
00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:13.475
There's a lot of similarities.

228
00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:16.915
Like we talk about the birth of Christ in

229
00:11:17.475 --> 00:11:19.635
Christmas season 2000 years ago.

230
00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:23.195
In Bethlehem, we talk about it as if it's the first advent

231
00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:26.095
you maybe heard of this season called advent.

232
00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:28.415
What does that word mean? Advent means appearing.

233
00:11:29.635 --> 00:11:32.895
And so when Jesus showed up 2000 years ago on the scene,

234
00:11:33.315 --> 00:11:35.135
it was his first appearing.

235
00:11:36.935 --> 00:11:39.785
Well, in a way, don't you know

236
00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:42.265
that there's a second advent coming.

237
00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:47.685
There's a second appearing of Jesus coming.

238
00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:53.845
He's gonna return Acts one says just like he left when he

239
00:11:54.165 --> 00:11:56.925
ascended into the clouds and the clouds hit him from sight.

240
00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:59.645
As the apostles watched that happen, it says

241
00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:02.725
explicitly angels told him he's coming back just

242
00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:03.965
the same way that he left.

243
00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:08.375
So he's going to be visible again from the clouds down

244
00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:09.855
to the new heavens

245
00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:14.115
and new earth someday a second advent.

246
00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:20.355
And so in that sense, we are all sent

247
00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:24.435
by God to be witnesses about the light.

248
00:12:26.085 --> 00:12:28.095
John said, Hey, the light's showing up, the light's coming.

249
00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:29.855
I'm pointing you to the light, the true light

250
00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:31.095
that's coming soon.

251
00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:36.255
We are witnesses about the true light who's coming

252
00:12:36.365 --> 00:12:38.175
soon in a similar way.

253
00:12:38.355 --> 00:12:41.895
Why? So that all may believe through him.

254
00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:43.615
That's what John was doing.

255
00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:47.255
He wanted all to believe through him.

256
00:12:47.515 --> 00:12:48.935
We aren't the light either,

257
00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:51.695
but we are witnesses about the light so that all may believe

258
00:12:52.075 --> 00:12:53.175
that's what we want.

259
00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:56.015
Right? And think about what a witness does.

260
00:12:56.965 --> 00:12:59.215
Hopefully none of you have been in a situation like the

261
00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:00.815
picture shows, but what does a witness do

262
00:13:00.815 --> 00:13:01.935
in a situation like that?

263
00:13:03.175 --> 00:13:06.175
A witness just tells what they know, what they've seen,

264
00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:07.055
what they've heard, what

265
00:13:07.055 --> 00:13:08.215
they've felt, what they've experienced.

266
00:13:08.215 --> 00:13:10.295
That's all it is. You're not arguing anything.

267
00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:13.535
You're just stating the facts of what you know

268
00:13:14.185 --> 00:13:15.655
about the case at hand.

269
00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:20.615
That's what a witness does. It's all John did.

270
00:13:21.405 --> 00:13:24.655
What did John do? John just stood there in the wilderness.

271
00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:25.735
People came to him.

272
00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:27.655
He reminded them of the prophecies,

273
00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:30.015
all the Old Testament that they knew.

274
00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:32.565
He reminded them of those truths.

275
00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:34.685
And then he pointed them to the truth of

276
00:13:34.785 --> 00:13:37.045
who this Messiah was going to be

277
00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:39.405
and what they needed to do in their hearts

278
00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:40.605
to repent and believe.

279
00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:44.465
That's all it was. Listen,

280
00:13:44.465 --> 00:13:46.105
that's all we're supposed to do as well.

281
00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:51.975
That's our job. Just as much to just declare

282
00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:55.135
who he is, declare what he's done, declare

283
00:13:55.315 --> 00:13:58.455
how he has saved us, declare how he has sustained us.

284
00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:02.305
That's all we're doing. We're just witnesses about the light

285
00:14:02.305 --> 00:14:04.145
that's changed us, that brought us out

286
00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:05.865
of darkness into his marvelous light.

287
00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:08.815
That's all similar to what John did.

288
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.575
And so we declare it.

289
00:14:11.675 --> 00:14:14.975
But then also along with that, we live out a life

290
00:14:15.885 --> 00:14:18.895
that reflects that light to others.

291
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:24.345
Just listen to Jesus how he put it

292
00:14:24.925 --> 00:14:28.465
in Matthew chapter five, verses 14 through 16.

293
00:14:28.525 --> 00:14:30.185
Now remember, we aren't the light,

294
00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:32.745
we're witnesses about the light,

295
00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:36.075
but you are the light of the world.

296
00:14:36.085 --> 00:14:40.035
Jesus says So he, wait a second, we're not the light,

297
00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:41.755
but he says, now you are the light of the world.

298
00:14:41.865 --> 00:14:43.395
Okay? So we will talk about that in a second.

299
00:14:43.655 --> 00:14:45.235
But he says, you are the light of the world.

300
00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:47.395
A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,

301
00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:50.475
nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,

302
00:14:50.735 --> 00:14:51.965
but but on a stand.

303
00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:55.685
And it gives light to all in the house. In the same way.

304
00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:57.045
Let your light shine

305
00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:00.605
before others so that they may see your good works

306
00:15:01.065 --> 00:15:04.445
and give glory to your father who is in heaven.

307
00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:09.995
So what it says is that no, we're not the true light.

308
00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:14.595
But think about this, just like the moon that was a bright

309
00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:16.355
full moon last night, right?

310
00:15:16.545 --> 00:15:19.275
Just like the moon has no light in itself.

311
00:15:20.805 --> 00:15:23.505
The only way it shines is by reflecting the light

312
00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:25.225
of the sun to us.

313
00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:32.885
Same way we are not light in ourselves,

314
00:15:33.505 --> 00:15:38.205
but the true light inside of us shines brightly so

315
00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:40.485
that all may believe, all may glorify

316
00:15:40.485 --> 00:15:41.685
our Father who is in heaven.

317
00:15:43.325 --> 00:15:45.145
The true light has come.

318
00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:48.705
And what we do as we do that, hear me as we do that,

319
00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:52.025
as we speak witness about who he is

320
00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:54.985
and what he's done as we live lives that reflect his light.

321
00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:58.345
Watch what happens. We are preparing the way

322
00:15:58.685 --> 00:16:00.665
for the Messiah to come again.

323
00:16:02.615 --> 00:16:03.755
The second advent's coming.

324
00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:07.075
We are witnessing about the light, preparing the way

325
00:16:07.075 --> 00:16:10.115
for the light, praying, working, witnessing

326
00:16:10.265 --> 00:16:12.235
that all might believe through him.

327
00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:18.605
You see the parallels here, but here's what can happen.

328
00:16:19.815 --> 00:16:22.035
We can feel a lot of pressure with that.

329
00:16:22.985 --> 00:16:24.835
Like that's overwhelm. Okay, well man,

330
00:16:24.835 --> 00:16:26.115
we gotta be witnesses about the light.

331
00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:28.275
But I'm not really a great witness of that. I'm not perfect.

332
00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:31.235
Okay? Well here's the beauty of this.

333
00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:33.655
Here's the the grace.

334
00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:38.595
It's not based on how well we do at that.

335
00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:44.915
It wasn't based on John's ability

336
00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:46.955
to speak well enough

337
00:16:46.955 --> 00:16:48.875
to baptize well enough to do all the he.

338
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:49.915
It wasn't based on that

339
00:16:51.995 --> 00:16:56.405
because thankfully it wasn't just how well we witnessed

340
00:16:56.405 --> 00:16:58.285
or how well he witnessed about the light.

341
00:16:58.285 --> 00:17:02.125
Thankfully God sent the true light himself.

342
00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:05.885
We don't just have to be a great example.

343
00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.125
We don't have to be all of this perfect

344
00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:10.245
reflection to the world.

345
00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:11.645
Like we don't have to be that

346
00:17:11.995 --> 00:17:15.885
because God sent the true light himself.

347
00:17:18.995 --> 00:17:20.205
Look again at verse nine.

348
00:17:21.495 --> 00:17:23.795
The true light which gives light

349
00:17:23.795 --> 00:17:26.795
to everyone was coming into the world,

350
00:17:28.775 --> 00:17:32.825
Like to a world walking around in a pitch black bedroom.

351
00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:39.735
The light has come. The light himself came.

352
00:17:40.235 --> 00:17:42.415
And we learned so much about this light.

353
00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:44.335
Like last week we learned about the word.

354
00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:46.375
What is his character? Who is he?

355
00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:49.725
What does he do This week we learn about this light.

356
00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:53.165
What do we learn about him? Well look just back into

357
00:17:53.165 --> 00:17:54.845
what we looked at last week verses four

358
00:17:54.845 --> 00:17:58.945
and five real quick about the word in

359
00:17:59.005 --> 00:18:00.465
him was life.

360
00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:03.545
That's physical, spiritual, emotional life.

361
00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:06.785
And the life was the light of men.

362
00:18:07.885 --> 00:18:10.305
The light shines in the darkness

363
00:18:10.885 --> 00:18:14.105
and the darkness has not overcome it.

364
00:18:16.175 --> 00:18:19.315
So the eternal word here equated

365
00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:20.635
with the true light of the world.

366
00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:24.795
That figure that messiah, the giver of life.

367
00:18:24.795 --> 00:18:26.555
What we learned from him is that when he came,

368
00:18:27.175 --> 00:18:29.435
the darkness lost to him.

369
00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:31.665
Do you see it in verse five?

370
00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:35.835
The darkness has not overcome it. The darkness lost to him.

371
00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:40.945
The darkness lost. This concept of darkness.

372
00:18:40.945 --> 00:18:42.545
This is all over scripture.

373
00:18:43.595 --> 00:18:45.615
If you would do a word study on darkness, just like going

374
00:18:45.615 --> 00:18:49.415
to word uh, in the Bible software, online search,

375
00:18:49.655 --> 00:18:51.495
whatever it is, and you search the word darkness

376
00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:53.735
or dark in scripture, it's everywhere.

377
00:18:53.835 --> 00:18:57.375
And what it refers to is evil or sin

378
00:18:57.915 --> 00:18:59.455
or especially death.

379
00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:04.295
I think all of that is included here.

380
00:19:04.905 --> 00:19:09.585
When I say the darkness lost to light, lost

381
00:19:09.685 --> 00:19:13.185
to the Messiah, all of that is included.

382
00:19:13.295 --> 00:19:17.625
Just hear this. Think of Jesus saying it in John 1633.

383
00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:22.095
He says in me, you may have peace in the world,

384
00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:23.135
you'll have tribulation.

385
00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:26.535
But take heart, I have overcome the world.

386
00:19:30.075 --> 00:19:33.885
Like he's talking about all the evil that pervades

387
00:19:34.305 --> 00:19:36.005
around us in the world.

388
00:19:36.335 --> 00:19:39.625
Jesus says, hold up. It's gonna cause you trouble.

389
00:19:40.455 --> 00:19:41.545
I've overcome it.

390
00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:46.155
The darkness, evil lost to him.

391
00:19:48.085 --> 00:19:49.465
Or think of Colossians two.

392
00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:55.155
Jesus forgives our sins by canceling the record of debt

393
00:19:55.385 --> 00:19:57.995
that stood against us with its legal demands.

394
00:19:58.505 --> 00:20:01.835
This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.

395
00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:05.035
He disarmed the rulers and authorities

396
00:20:05.255 --> 00:20:09.795
and put them to open shame by triumphing over them in him.

397
00:20:11.095 --> 00:20:15.115
That's victory language, right? The darkness lost to him.

398
00:20:15.295 --> 00:20:17.475
The darkness of sin lost to him.

399
00:20:17.615 --> 00:20:20.075
In fact, one John three, five, great Christmas verse.

400
00:20:20.535 --> 00:20:22.875
He appeared to take away sins.

401
00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:28.125
His advent was to take away our sin,

402
00:20:29.935 --> 00:20:33.875
the darkness of sin lost to him in his life, death

403
00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:37.915
and resurrection like this is what Jesus came to do.

404
00:20:38.015 --> 00:20:40.195
Or think of one Corinthians 15

405
00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:42.895
talking about Christ's resurrection,

406
00:20:43.115 --> 00:20:44.935
how it has purchased resurrection for us.

407
00:20:44.935 --> 00:20:48.765
Listen to this, I tell you this, flesh

408
00:20:48.865 --> 00:20:51.205
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,

409
00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:54.685
nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.

410
00:20:55.065 --> 00:20:57.965
Behold, I tell you a mystery where shall not all sleep,

411
00:20:58.185 --> 00:20:59.485
we shall all be changed.

412
00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:02.645
In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet,

413
00:21:02.645 --> 00:21:06.765
that second advent, the trumpet will sound the dead will be

414
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:07.885
raised imperishable.

415
00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:10.845
We shall be changed. This perishable body, the one

416
00:21:10.845 --> 00:21:13.605
that we wear right now that we're dying and sick in

417
00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:16.645
and all the things this perish body must put on the

418
00:21:16.645 --> 00:21:20.285
imperishable, this mortal body must put on immortality.

419
00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:22.445
When the perishable puts on the imperishable,

420
00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.405
the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come

421
00:21:25.425 --> 00:21:27.005
to pass the saying that is written.

422
00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:31.165
Check this out. Death is swallowed up in victory.

423
00:21:32.545 --> 00:21:34.085
Oh, death. Where is your victory?

424
00:21:34.415 --> 00:21:36.965
Death, where is your sting?

425
00:21:36.965 --> 00:21:38.885
Because the sting of death is sin.

426
00:21:38.915 --> 00:21:40.405
It's going to happen because of sin.

427
00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:41.925
The power of sin is the law.

428
00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:46.125
But thanks be to God who gives us the victory

429
00:21:46.515 --> 00:21:48.445
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

430
00:21:51.115 --> 00:21:56.005
Evil sin, death lost, darkness lost

431
00:21:57.155 --> 00:21:58.655
to the Messiah, to the true light.

432
00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:05.035
So I don't want us to ever deny the fact

433
00:22:05.035 --> 00:22:06.075
that it's dark in our world.

434
00:22:07.725 --> 00:22:11.785
It is dark, evil pervades.

435
00:22:13.045 --> 00:22:15.145
Sin is heavy.

436
00:22:16.855 --> 00:22:21.565
Death comes regularly. It's dark.

437
00:22:22.565 --> 00:22:25.235
We're walking through a very dark world.

438
00:22:25.575 --> 00:22:28.515
But the light shines in the darkness

439
00:22:28.615 --> 00:22:30.315
and the darkness has not overcome it.

440
00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:33.715
This is the light. The true light has come

441
00:22:33.975 --> 00:22:36.955
and the world has lost darkness, has lost sin,

442
00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:39.595
has lost evil has lost to him.

443
00:22:40.735 --> 00:22:44.115
That's good news at Christmas. It's good news every day.

444
00:22:46.415 --> 00:22:49.955
So as I talk about that, you know, you think, man,

445
00:22:49.955 --> 00:22:51.355
everybody would wanna be a part of that, right?

446
00:22:52.525 --> 00:22:54.545
Who wouldn't want to walk in light instead

447
00:22:54.545 --> 00:22:55.745
of walking in darkness, kind

448
00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:57.505
of feeling your way and stubbing your toe?

449
00:22:57.505 --> 00:23:00.585
Like who wouldn't want to walk in this light?

450
00:23:00.585 --> 00:23:02.545
Well, the reality is some people just walk around

451
00:23:02.545 --> 00:23:03.585
with their eyes closed.

452
00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:10.825
You saw it in first in in John one verses nine and 10.

453
00:23:10.925 --> 00:23:12.145
The true light which gives light

454
00:23:12.145 --> 00:23:13.625
to everyone was coming into the world.

455
00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:16.985
He was in the world and the world was made through him.

456
00:23:17.365 --> 00:23:19.745
Yet the world did not know him.

457
00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:27.405
This word, the creator, the true light,

458
00:23:27.585 --> 00:23:29.005
he was finally here.

459
00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:31.765
But it says the world did not know him.

460
00:23:33.775 --> 00:23:35.875
We might say it this way. The world ignored him.

461
00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:40.335
The world ignored him.

462
00:23:44.755 --> 00:23:46.255
Now we just read it though.

463
00:23:46.255 --> 00:23:50.855
Verse nine says, the true light gives light to everyone.

464
00:23:50.995 --> 00:23:54.175
So how are people still walking in darkness?

465
00:23:54.175 --> 00:23:55.575
How do they still not know him

466
00:23:56.315 --> 00:23:58.135
if he's given light to everyone, how?

467
00:23:58.135 --> 00:24:00.215
How? This is a contradiction. Is that what this is?

468
00:24:03.305 --> 00:24:04.595
They're still walking in darkness

469
00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:08.355
because of the blinding effects of sin.

470
00:24:11.465 --> 00:24:13.925
Romans one explains this really well.

471
00:24:16.045 --> 00:24:18.455
Just listen to verses 18 to 25.

472
00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:21.055
One example of it says, the wrath

473
00:24:21.055 --> 00:24:24.375
of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness

474
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:27.935
and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness,

475
00:24:28.415 --> 00:24:29.415
suppress the truth.

476
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:34.235
For what can be known about God is plain to them

477
00:24:34.465 --> 00:24:36.915
because God has shown it to them

478
00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:40.955
for his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power.

479
00:24:41.015 --> 00:24:44.315
Divine nature have been clearly perceived

480
00:24:45.545 --> 00:24:47.195
ever since the creation of the world

481
00:24:48.555 --> 00:24:49.855
in the things that have been made.

482
00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:53.005
Meaning we can tell there's something out there.

483
00:24:53.005 --> 00:24:54.085
There's a God out there.

484
00:24:54.315 --> 00:24:57.325
This is who he is, kind of his character just

485
00:24:57.325 --> 00:24:58.405
by looking at creation.

486
00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:04.545
So they are without excuse for

487
00:25:04.785 --> 00:25:08.025
although they knew God, they did not honor him as God

488
00:25:08.325 --> 00:25:09.545
or give thanks to him,

489
00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:11.585
but they became futile in their thinking.

490
00:25:11.755 --> 00:25:14.705
Their foolish hearts were, what's the word?

491
00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:19.215
Darkened, claiming to be wise.

492
00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:22.535
They became fools, exchanged the glory of the immortal God

493
00:25:22.675 --> 00:25:25.735
for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals

494
00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:26.815
and creeping things.

495
00:25:27.115 --> 00:25:29.375
That's the effect of sin.

496
00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:31.055
The rest of it even talks about preferring

497
00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:34.575
and supporting the works of darkness instead

498
00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:35.975
of the works of God.

499
00:25:35.975 --> 00:25:39.695
And all of that comes back to rejecting God as

500
00:25:39.755 --> 00:25:40.895
who he is as king.

501
00:25:44.235 --> 00:25:48.725
So the fact that he has given light

502
00:25:49.065 --> 00:25:52.245
to everyone is why Romans one can say

503
00:25:52.245 --> 00:25:53.645
that all are without excuse.

504
00:25:53.835 --> 00:25:56.365
Because apart from God's intervention, every one

505
00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:58.245
of us has rejected the light.

506
00:25:58.245 --> 00:26:00.485
Every one of us have rejected God.

507
00:26:02.815 --> 00:26:05.735
And what do we get when we reject God? We get darkness.

508
00:26:07.185 --> 00:26:08.885
We get darkness now in our lives.

509
00:26:08.905 --> 00:26:10.605
We get destruction now in our lives.

510
00:26:10.665 --> 00:26:13.765
We get darkness forever separated from God.

511
00:26:17.055 --> 00:26:19.195
Listen, I just want just a side note here.

512
00:26:22.195 --> 00:26:26.505
Beware of rejecting God's commands and

513
00:26:26.505 --> 00:26:28.905
and God's plan in your life.

514
00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:35.515
It only leads to destruction. It only leads to darkness.

515
00:26:37.445 --> 00:26:39.225
And it doesn't have to be massive big.

516
00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:40.905
It can be really subtle. Small things.

517
00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:44.765
Rejecting his plan, his commands for your own way,

518
00:26:44.865 --> 00:26:48.245
for the world's way will lead to destruction.

519
00:26:52.495 --> 00:26:57.135
So the world ignored him. The world does ignore him.

520
00:27:00.105 --> 00:27:02.325
But there's an even further rejection of God here.

521
00:27:02.635 --> 00:27:05.285
John in chapter one explains the way that most

522
00:27:05.285 --> 00:27:09.885
of the Jews at the time of Jesus responded to this light.

523
00:27:09.885 --> 00:27:11.165
Look at verse 11 again.

524
00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:17.025
It says, he came to his own, meaning his own people.

525
00:27:17.165 --> 00:27:19.865
His own people did not receive him.

526
00:27:23.315 --> 00:27:25.715
'cause remember, Jesus was born into a Jewish family.

527
00:27:26.335 --> 00:27:28.635
He was born in a Jewish area.

528
00:27:29.015 --> 00:27:32.915
He was born among Jewish customs. He was raised Jewish.

529
00:27:33.095 --> 00:27:37.155
He studied the Jewish scriptures. This was his people.

530
00:27:37.975 --> 00:27:39.195
He was an Israelite.

531
00:27:41.405 --> 00:27:45.145
Yet how did the majority of his own people respond to him?

532
00:27:47.675 --> 00:27:48.565
They refused him.

533
00:27:52.215 --> 00:27:53.065
They refused him.

534
00:27:53.325 --> 00:27:57.345
The world ignored him. His own people refused him.

535
00:27:59.855 --> 00:28:01.595
And this is people, listen, remember this.

536
00:28:01.685 --> 00:28:03.915
These are people who knew the prophecies

537
00:28:05.335 --> 00:28:06.745
from hundreds of years ago.

538
00:28:07.135 --> 00:28:09.545
They knew all the answers. They knew who they were.

539
00:28:09.695 --> 00:28:11.345
They they they were looking for.

540
00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:13.985
And many of those prophecies had been fulfilled when

541
00:28:13.995 --> 00:28:15.265
Jesus was born.

542
00:28:15.615 --> 00:28:16.625
Like they had it all.

543
00:28:16.655 --> 00:28:19.705
They even had expectant hearts 'cause Rome was taking over.

544
00:28:19.725 --> 00:28:20.785
And they were thinking like, man,

545
00:28:20.855 --> 00:28:22.625
this Messiah's gotta come right now.

546
00:28:22.855 --> 00:28:24.385
Sure seems like this is the right time.

547
00:28:24.495 --> 00:28:27.625
They were expectant for the Messiah, but they missed it.

548
00:28:30.905 --> 00:28:32.155
They were looking for something else.

549
00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:35.755
They were wanting someone else.

550
00:28:35.865 --> 00:28:38.755
They were wanting someone militarily invested

551
00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:41.155
to ha drive out those hated Romans.

552
00:28:41.185 --> 00:28:44.115
They wanted somebody to come take back the land

553
00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:46.755
and come to free them from oppression.

554
00:28:46.855 --> 00:28:48.955
That's what they thought they wanted.

555
00:28:49.015 --> 00:28:50.515
And when Jesus failed

556
00:28:50.575 --> 00:28:52.715
to meet those expectations, what happened?

557
00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:59.245
They crucified it. Now it

558
00:28:59.245 --> 00:29:00.845
was God's plan for him to be crucified.

559
00:29:00.945 --> 00:29:03.325
But the Jewish people were responsible

560
00:29:04.685 --> 00:29:07.895
because they refused him as the Messiah that he was.

561
00:29:07.895 --> 00:29:12.495
Listen, I fear that something similar is happening today.

562
00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:17.695
Now we're not gonna re crucify Jesus.

563
00:29:17.705 --> 00:29:19.135
We're not standing here rejecting him

564
00:29:19.135 --> 00:29:20.815
and say, give us Barabbas instead of Him.

565
00:29:20.975 --> 00:29:25.275
We're not doing that. But there are people

566
00:29:25.325 --> 00:29:30.105
everywhere who are rejecting God for

567
00:29:30.325 --> 00:29:33.325
who he is, not for who he is.

568
00:29:33.415 --> 00:29:37.205
Sorry, they're rejecting God not for who he is, but

569
00:29:37.205 --> 00:29:39.645
because he doesn't fulfill some unfair

570
00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:42.285
or selfish expectation they have of him.

571
00:29:46.445 --> 00:29:49.665
So it's not because of like just the truth of who he is.

572
00:29:49.935 --> 00:29:53.825
It's that they have imposed some selfish or materialistic

573
00:29:54.005 --> 00:29:55.825
or unfair expectation on God

574
00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:57.665
that if you don't do this, then I'm out.

575
00:29:58.005 --> 00:29:59.185
And he never said he was gonna do it.

576
00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:03.655
And so we're rejecting some version of God that we think

577
00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.655
or the problem comes

578
00:30:05.655 --> 00:30:07.735
where we grow up in a Christian environment

579
00:30:07.915 --> 00:30:09.655
and we culturally look the part.

580
00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:12.575
We know the answers to the questions in Sunday school,

581
00:30:12.795 --> 00:30:15.335
but we have no personal life-giving relationship

582
00:30:15.405 --> 00:30:16.575
with God by faith.

583
00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:24.705
If that was happening back then, it can still happen today.

584
00:30:27.545 --> 00:30:29.405
We can look the part, we can have the answers,

585
00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:31.765
but we don't know God.

586
00:30:31.825 --> 00:30:36.105
So be careful. Be careful not

587
00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:39.465
to merely go through the motions of Christianity.

588
00:30:41.615 --> 00:30:45.435
Be careful not to put on God something that He's not

589
00:30:46.165 --> 00:30:48.675
where he is never promised.

590
00:30:52.895 --> 00:30:56.545
Because what John is calling us to here in verses 12

591
00:30:56.565 --> 00:31:01.335
and 13 is the counter to all of that, the counter

592
00:31:01.435 --> 00:31:05.015
to this fake churchianity kind of reality

593
00:31:05.195 --> 00:31:08.295
or to reject God because he's something that he's not.

594
00:31:08.795 --> 00:31:11.535
He never said he was, but rejecting something we've put on

595
00:31:11.535 --> 00:31:16.015
him the counter to all of that, the counter to someone

596
00:31:16.115 --> 00:31:19.575
who is walking in darkness to the counter, to someone

597
00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:21.655
who is walking in death.

598
00:31:21.865 --> 00:31:23.815
Watch this verses 12 and 13.

599
00:31:25.195 --> 00:31:28.855
But to all who did receive him, not those who ignored him,

600
00:31:28.855 --> 00:31:33.055
those who refuse him, to those who did receive this light,

601
00:31:33.315 --> 00:31:36.095
who believed in his name, he gave the right

602
00:31:36.155 --> 00:31:40.675
to become children of God who were born not of blood,

603
00:31:40.675 --> 00:31:42.675
of the will of flesh, nor the will of man,

604
00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:45.315
but were born of God.

605
00:31:45.335 --> 00:31:48.235
Listen, here's the truth, you can receive him.

606
00:31:51.285 --> 00:31:52.465
The world ignored him.

607
00:31:53.715 --> 00:31:56.815
The people he was among at the time refused him.

608
00:31:57.275 --> 00:31:58.855
You can receive him.

609
00:32:02.895 --> 00:32:05.555
And this, this is true.

610
00:32:05.935 --> 00:32:09.715
It doesn't matter how dark the path you've been

611
00:32:09.715 --> 00:32:10.835
walking has been.

612
00:32:14.495 --> 00:32:18.715
It. It doesn't matter how blind you feel like you've been.

613
00:32:19.095 --> 00:32:23.275
The light shines in it and the darkness has not overcome it.

614
00:32:25.315 --> 00:32:27.415
It doesn't matter. You look at your life like,

615
00:32:27.415 --> 00:32:28.455
well, there's no way I could be saved.

616
00:32:28.515 --> 00:32:32.335
No this, this is talking about light shining in darkness.

617
00:32:32.435 --> 00:32:34.295
The whole point of this, this prophecy.

618
00:32:34.295 --> 00:32:38.135
Listen to this one, 700 years before Jesus came

619
00:32:38.315 --> 00:32:40.045
before God, the Son took on flesh.

620
00:32:40.045 --> 00:32:42.565
Listen to Isaiah chapter nine verse two.

621
00:32:42.565 --> 00:32:44.485
700 years earlier, the people

622
00:32:44.585 --> 00:32:47.805
who walked in darkness have seen a great light.

623
00:32:49.135 --> 00:32:53.485
Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them has light

624
00:32:54.015 --> 00:32:56.745
shone Israel.

625
00:32:56.795 --> 00:32:58.505
Let's talk about them walking in

626
00:32:58.785 --> 00:32:59.945
darkness for hundreds of years.

627
00:32:59.975 --> 00:33:02.385
They have no hope. They're waiting for the Messiah

628
00:33:02.525 --> 00:33:03.865
for his light to show up.

629
00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:05.265
And he did.

630
00:33:06.605 --> 00:33:10.085
Hundreds of years later he did so thank God

631
00:33:10.085 --> 00:33:11.205
for that, that he did it.

632
00:33:11.225 --> 00:33:14.045
But it also applies to those of us today

633
00:33:14.305 --> 00:33:15.965
who are still walking in darkness,

634
00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:21.395
feeling their way through a dark room.

635
00:33:22.515 --> 00:33:26.995
Stubbing toes lost without hope.

636
00:33:31.325 --> 00:33:33.145
How exhausting is that right?

637
00:33:36.205 --> 00:33:37.865
To try to make it

638
00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:41.495
through life slowly.

639
00:33:42.495 --> 00:33:44.295
Tripping and hurting and falling

640
00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:45.695
and destruction and darkness.

641
00:33:46.235 --> 00:33:48.295
How exhausting is that

642
00:33:53.235 --> 00:33:53.455
yet?

643
00:33:53.455 --> 00:33:56.935
Hear me clearly today. It doesn't have to be that way.

644
00:34:00.095 --> 00:34:05.035
You don't have to. In

645
00:34:05.035 --> 00:34:06.955
fact, that's why God brought you here today.

646
00:34:09.135 --> 00:34:11.195
That's why God put a Christian friend in your life.

647
00:34:13.515 --> 00:34:14.595
Somebody in your neighborhood invited you

648
00:34:14.595 --> 00:34:17.395
to their Christmas party and you showed up here today.

649
00:34:17.395 --> 00:34:19.555
That's why God did that.

650
00:34:20.105 --> 00:34:23.915
Acts 1727 says that they should seek God

651
00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:27.395
and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him.

652
00:34:28.095 --> 00:34:29.875
Yet he's actually not far from each one of us.

653
00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:36.115
Why did God put that reflector of light in your life?

654
00:34:36.505 --> 00:34:39.635
It's so that you would see and find God.

655
00:34:41.985 --> 00:34:45.125
Listen, friend, if you've been walking spiritually,

656
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:48.605
if you've been walking in darkness, if you've been trying

657
00:34:48.605 --> 00:34:51.205
to fill that hole in your heart or

658
00:34:51.505 --> 00:34:53.605
or whatever you might explain that to be,

659
00:34:53.605 --> 00:34:56.045
if you've been trying to fill that with pleasure

660
00:34:56.225 --> 00:34:57.245
or with stuff

661
00:34:57.545 --> 00:35:00.325
or with some other God that you've been seeking

662
00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:02.525
and you just find yourself still in darkness

663
00:35:02.525 --> 00:35:05.965
after darkness, yet right now you're sensing that

664
00:35:05.965 --> 00:35:09.045
for some reason God seems to be working in your heart,

665
00:35:09.045 --> 00:35:10.365
he's moving in your heart somehow.

666
00:35:10.815 --> 00:35:11.725
Don't run away from that.

667
00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:19.045
Don't run away from that. Because the reality is you cannot

668
00:35:19.235 --> 00:35:20.325
open your own eyes.

669
00:35:20.665 --> 00:35:24.365
You cannot open your own heart. You can't awaken your heart.

670
00:35:24.425 --> 00:35:25.565
You cannot do any of that.

671
00:35:25.785 --> 00:35:27.125
So the fact that God is,

672
00:35:27.145 --> 00:35:30.005
if you feel this prompting in your spirit towards

673
00:35:30.005 --> 00:35:32.645
what I've been sharing about today, that you can see Jesus,

674
00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:35.125
his life, death and resurrection in your place,

675
00:35:35.125 --> 00:35:36.885
you can start to see that that's starting to make sense.

676
00:35:36.925 --> 00:35:40.165
Sense for your hope for today, your hope for eternity.

677
00:35:40.195 --> 00:35:41.805
It's starting to click a little bit like that.

678
00:35:42.095 --> 00:35:44.365
Don't deny that. That's God himself.

679
00:35:47.045 --> 00:35:48.825
You didn't walk in here today like, yeah, I'm just,

680
00:35:48.965 --> 00:35:50.745
I'm gonna decide to believe this Jesus

681
00:35:50.745 --> 00:35:51.825
thing to no you didn't.

682
00:35:51.825 --> 00:35:54.665
Right? It's God's work. He's drawing you.

683
00:35:54.895 --> 00:35:58.065
He's moving in your heart. That's what verse 13 said, right?

684
00:35:58.325 --> 00:36:00.705
He says, who were born not of blood

685
00:36:00.705 --> 00:36:03.225
or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man,

686
00:36:03.365 --> 00:36:04.385
but born of God.

687
00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:08.695
There's nothing you can do to make yourself born,

688
00:36:08.755 --> 00:36:10.935
to make yourself alive on your own.

689
00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:14.135
You're dead spiritually, but God can make you alive.

690
00:36:14.635 --> 00:36:16.935
God can give you this new birth.

691
00:36:16.935 --> 00:36:19.815
It's not a physical birth, it's a spiritual birth

692
00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:21.825
where he makes you

693
00:36:21.965 --> 00:36:26.095
new again.

694
00:36:26.095 --> 00:36:30.625
You and I can't do that. There's no sacrifice

695
00:36:30.725 --> 00:36:32.625
or amount of sacrifices we could give.

696
00:36:33.455 --> 00:36:37.145
There's no strong act that we could do to manufacture this.

697
00:36:37.145 --> 00:36:40.465
There's no emotional desire we could have that's deep enough

698
00:36:40.465 --> 00:36:41.625
or we cry hard enough.

699
00:36:41.895 --> 00:36:46.825
None of that matters. Only

700
00:36:46.925 --> 00:36:50.185
by God's spirit are you drawn to him

701
00:36:50.525 --> 00:36:51.905
and made new spiritually.

702
00:36:53.425 --> 00:36:55.365
If you sense that in your heart right now,

703
00:36:55.365 --> 00:36:56.765
that's God working in you.

704
00:36:58.375 --> 00:37:01.515
'cause this is not natural. It's not natural to want

705
00:37:01.515 --> 00:37:03.635
to confess your sin and find hope in Christ

706
00:37:03.695 --> 00:37:04.995
and something outside of yourself.

707
00:37:04.995 --> 00:37:06.435
That doesn't happen naturally.

708
00:37:07.465 --> 00:37:09.725
It only happens by God's spirit.

709
00:37:10.945 --> 00:37:12.725
And so if you're feeling drawn by God,

710
00:37:13.025 --> 00:37:14.445
you don't want to ignore that.

711
00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:16.085
You don't want to refuse that.

712
00:37:16.085 --> 00:37:17.525
What you want to do is receive that.

713
00:37:18.305 --> 00:37:22.815
How do he say, how do you receive the gift

714
00:37:22.845 --> 00:37:24.175
that he's talking about here?

715
00:37:24.345 --> 00:37:27.815
Verse 12. By believing in his name,

716
00:37:31.385 --> 00:37:33.805
by orienting the hope of your life

717
00:37:33.945 --> 00:37:36.365
and your eternity toward all that he is

718
00:37:36.545 --> 00:37:41.135
and all that he's done believing, not just agreeing,

719
00:37:41.165 --> 00:37:42.735
believe like God, I'm all in.

720
00:37:42.975 --> 00:37:44.255
I am yours.

721
00:37:45.725 --> 00:37:49.025
I'm turning away from anything that I've believed before.

722
00:37:49.365 --> 00:37:51.465
I'm turning away from the things that I turned to

723
00:37:51.485 --> 00:37:54.385
before to to find life, to find light.

724
00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:57.345
It didn't work. I'm turning to you as my life

725
00:37:57.445 --> 00:37:59.105
and my light in everything.

726
00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:03.345
'cause that's then what he promises to do

727
00:38:03.685 --> 00:38:07.625
as he works in your life is he's going to lead you to

728
00:38:07.655 --> 00:38:10.585
that light switch of faith so that when you walk

729
00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:13.425
through your room, the light's on, it's flooded your heart

730
00:38:13.565 --> 00:38:16.145
and you can actually walk in life

731
00:38:18.615 --> 00:38:21.065
because then it gives confidence, humble confidence

732
00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:24.065
that you can walk through the rooms of your life

733
00:38:24.105 --> 00:38:27.025
because you are in the light as he is in the light.

734
00:38:27.225 --> 00:38:30.295
Scripture says it's a whole

735
00:38:30.295 --> 00:38:31.335
different way of seeing the world.

736
00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:33.455
It's a whole different way of seeing

737
00:38:33.455 --> 00:38:35.605
everything in our lives.

738
00:38:35.625 --> 00:38:37.205
And you know what might be the best part of this?

739
00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:44.655
What did it say God gives to those

740
00:38:44.715 --> 00:38:46.535
who receive him by faith?

741
00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:52.975
The right to become children of God.

742
00:38:57.235 --> 00:38:58.235
Now,

743
00:38:58.645 --> 00:39:02.095
Like Just think about being God's

744
00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:05.495
child, right?

745
00:39:05.565 --> 00:39:10.055
Just when you're hurting, when you're,

746
00:39:11.635 --> 00:39:12.175
you're needy,

747
00:39:17.235 --> 00:39:21.375
God of the universe looks at you

748
00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:22.855
as his child like believer.

749
00:39:22.855 --> 00:39:26.455
Listen that that means a whole lot.

750
00:39:26.755 --> 00:39:30.495
But just think of this, you are in the royal line now.

751
00:39:33.555 --> 00:39:35.935
You're a child of God,

752
00:39:37.885 --> 00:39:42.255
full access to and power from God Almighty.

753
00:39:45.325 --> 00:39:49.095
What a gift, right? That's Christmas.

754
00:39:50.435 --> 00:39:54.735
He came as the light to do all of this for us so

755
00:39:54.735 --> 00:39:56.495
that we could be children of

756
00:39:56.555 --> 00:39:57.555
God.

757
00:39:59.715 --> 00:40:01.375
That's what the true light brings church.

758
00:40:03.435 --> 00:40:07.895
So let's rejoice like overwhelmingly rejoice in the fact

759
00:40:07.895 --> 00:40:10.575
that he's made us by faith, his children,

760
00:40:11.395 --> 00:40:14.735
and let's reflect that light to others so

761
00:40:14.735 --> 00:40:17.615
that they might believe and become children of God as well.

762
00:40:18.955 --> 00:40:21.135
So if you would pray with me towards those ends,

763
00:40:26.405 --> 00:40:28.535
just as we do enter a time of prayer,

764
00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:37.775
search your heart and see if this

765
00:40:38.995 --> 00:40:41.335
belief is true of you.

766
00:40:46.545 --> 00:40:48.335
Maybe it is for the first time you're,

767
00:40:48.335 --> 00:40:50.895
you're awakening in your heart to this reality

768
00:40:50.895 --> 00:40:52.095
of who he is and what he's done.

769
00:40:55.565 --> 00:40:59.615
What do you do with that? Romans says, you

770
00:41:00.165 --> 00:41:02.815
believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,

771
00:41:02.815 --> 00:41:04.615
that he did everything needed to save you.

772
00:41:04.835 --> 00:41:08.015
And you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.

773
00:41:10.355 --> 00:41:13.055
You say, God, I'm in like inside your heart.

774
00:41:13.075 --> 00:41:16.255
You say, God, I believe this. I am in. That's my hope.

775
00:41:16.515 --> 00:41:18.135
And then you confess with your mouth,

776
00:41:21.225 --> 00:41:22.295
Jesus is my Lord.

777
00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:27.735
And so you run to him in your heart,

778
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:28.975
you say, God, I'm a sinner.

779
00:41:29.055 --> 00:41:31.015
I cannot say myself. I can't awaken myself,

780
00:41:31.015 --> 00:41:32.335
but you seem to be awakening me.

781
00:41:32.335 --> 00:41:33.605
So I'm coming to you for salvation.

782
00:41:36.225 --> 00:41:40.205
And then tell somebody about it.

783
00:41:44.665 --> 00:41:45.765
Say, Jesus is my Lord

784
00:41:45.765 --> 00:41:49.285
and Savior that'ss what Scripture says,

785
00:41:49.625 --> 00:41:50.885
you will be saved.

786
00:41:52.145 --> 00:41:53.245
The true light has come,

787
00:41:55.425 --> 00:41:57.805
the darkness has not overcome it.

788
00:41:59.025 --> 00:42:01.125
No darkness in your life can overcome that.

789
00:42:02.905 --> 00:42:05.525
So run to 'em today, the light of the world.

790
00:42:09.825 --> 00:42:10.965
God, thank you for being that.

791
00:42:10.965 --> 00:42:12.365
Thank you for drawing us to yourself

792
00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:15.005
today, every day tomorrow.

793
00:42:16.865 --> 00:42:19.845
And we look forward to that second advent when you come back

794
00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:22.245
and we, we see you're appearing.

795
00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:31.685
God draws us. Give us belief, faith, trust more

796
00:42:31.685 --> 00:42:34.085
and more today, tomorrow, the next day,

797
00:42:34.135 --> 00:42:36.285
every day till you return.

798
00:42:38.435 --> 00:42:39.885
Help us worship you now in spirit

799
00:42:39.985 --> 00:42:42.605
and in truth in Jesus' authority.

800
00:42:43.035 --> 00:42:43.325
Amen.
