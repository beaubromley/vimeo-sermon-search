WEBVTT

1
00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:50.725
Hey.

2
00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:55.605
Funny to see you there. I didn't, um, somebody joked

3
00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:57.965
that I should get a lazyboy up here and see what happens.

4
00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:02.525
No, um, I'm just trying to move lower and lower every week

5
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.005
and so next week we're gonna be sitting on the

6
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:05.205
floor I guess.

7
00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.925
No, um, you may have noticed

8
00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:09.605
that there's some construction going on,

9
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:10.765
some work on our building.

10
00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.285
Uh, that's gonna be a couple more weeks out at least.

11
00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:16.005
It was pretty extensive as we had a busted pipe

12
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:17.045
during the freeze.

13
00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.725
I also had some work done on my knee this week

14
00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:21.805
and so, uh, happened

15
00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.285
to be a little more extensive than we originally thought.

16
00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.805
So that means my timeline's a little longer than we thought

17
00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:30.525
as well, but uh, it could be a lot worse.

18
00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:33.485
Uh, the worst part is I have a big incision right on my

19
00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:36.285
kneecap and so that makes it feel really good

20
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.245
to move it, bend it.

21
00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.005
Um, that may be TMI to some of you, but that's okay.

22
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:42.085
We're real. This is a family.

23
00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:44.765
So anyway, that's what we're at right now.

24
00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:47.005
It could be a lot worse, but yeah.

25
00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:50.205
So I can't let it hang is why I'm not standing

26
00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:54.085
or why I'm not on that stool

27
00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:55.325
that I've been the last few weeks.

28
00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:57.285
So anyway, what a beautiful morning.

29
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.325
We're not here for any of that. That's not why we're here.

30
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:02.525
Um, we're here to stare into the face of God

31
00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:07.005
and to to see his word, show us who he is,

32
00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:10.965
to worship him in response and to to grow in our love

33
00:02:11.025 --> 00:02:13.605
and to grow in our obedience to who he is

34
00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:15.165
and what he's done for us.

35
00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:17.885
And so to help us get to know him better, we've been going

36
00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:18.885
through this series where we've been

37
00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:20.085
calling first things first.

38
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:22.645
And so the first things that we need

39
00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:25.885
to put into our theological jar first, that's

40
00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:28.525
what we've been looking at the most important of our

41
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.365
doctrines, our beliefs, the core of what we believe.

42
00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:32.925
And we're gonna review regularly just

43
00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:34.045
so we get them in our heads.

44
00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:36.845
So just remember they're, they're coming every week.

45
00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:38.685
So remember the first one.

46
00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:41.165
What was the first one of our big rocks

47
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:42.365
that we put in a couple weeks ago?

48
00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:45.765
Revelation. Yeah, that's right. Alright, we're getting it.

49
00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:50.125
Okay. So revelation that God has told us about himself.

50
00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.325
Otherwise we wouldn't know much about who he is.

51
00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:58.245
What was the second one? At the attributes of God.

52
00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:00.605
This is what he's told us about himself,

53
00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:02.765
what he is and who he is.

54
00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.005
And so we put that in the jar.

55
00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:08.565
Now the third one last week, this is the new one.

56
00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:12.125
What did we look at last week? The Trinity?

57
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:15.245
Yeah, the three persons.

58
00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:19.725
One God, equal person. Same essence.

59
00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:22.845
That was the study of the Trinity, which was one

60
00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:24.725
of the most hard, difficult to understand.

61
00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:27.765
We know that, but it's also one of the most foundational

62
00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:32.045
for our faith and it separates us from everybody else.

63
00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:35.525
Biblical Christianity in this system is different

64
00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:36.565
because of that.

65
00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.805
We're gonna add one more rock today, of course,

66
00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:41.485
this fourth rock, uh, another one

67
00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.605
that could get us tripped up into all kinds

68
00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:46.045
of different heresies along the way as well.

69
00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:50.845
This rock is God the son, God the Son.

70
00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:52.165
Now we could talk about God the Father,

71
00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:53.765
God the Spirit like we talked to the Trinity,

72
00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:56.045
but we're just gonna focus on God the Son,

73
00:03:56.835 --> 00:04:00.765
what we call the incarnation Big word.

74
00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:02.965
That means God took on flesh

75
00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.045
and dwelled among us in order to save us.

76
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:10.125
That's the incarnation.

77
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:12.565
So we're gonna talk about that today and

78
00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:15.605
and this mystery, it's a mystery like last week, it's not

79
00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:18.645
as mind melting as the Trinity, but it's pretty close.

80
00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:20.685
So there's gonna be stuff that we're gonna have

81
00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:22.605
to really work through and talk about and look at.

82
00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:23.965
But the question we have

83
00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:26.565
to think about why this is such a mystery is how could

84
00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:31.245
the God that we saw last week, all

85
00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:36.085
that he is in his attributes, how could he retain all of

86
00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:40.685
that yet also take on a body like

87
00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:44.365
ours and not lose anything and

88
00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:46.925
and be, how could he not be tainted by the fact

89
00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:49.405
that he's taken on a body lesser?

90
00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:51.965
That's the question of the incarnation.

91
00:04:52.065 --> 00:04:53.765
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna follow the track

92
00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:55.925
of John one to help us try

93
00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:58.245
to understand this a little bit better.

94
00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:00.085
So go ahead and turn there with me if you would,

95
00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:03.765
in your copy of God's revelation of Himself, his word.

96
00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:05.485
We're gonna be in John one

97
00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:08.685
and just follow that track a little bit

98
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:14.005
to help us understand some things about this incarnation.

99
00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:16.805
Now this is one

100
00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:19.045
of the most beautiful passages in all of scripture.

101
00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:22.935
So I just wanna read it slowly

102
00:05:23.635 --> 00:05:26.215
and I want it to sit on our souls for a little bit

103
00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:28.495
as you just feel this passage

104
00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:34.495
and what God has said to us here, John one, all the way down

105
00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:35.535
through verse 18,

106
00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:42.975
in the beginning was the word and the word was with God.

107
00:05:43.955 --> 00:05:48.695
And the word was God. He was in the beginning with God.

108
00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:52.455
All things were made through him.

109
00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:56.255
And without him was not anything made

110
00:05:56.405 --> 00:05:59.525
that was made in him was life.

111
00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:02.325
And the life was the light of men.

112
00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:05.365
The light shines in the darkness

113
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.645
and the darkness has not overcome it.

114
00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:11.895
There was a man sent from God whose name was John.

115
00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:15.295
He came as a witness to bear witness about the light

116
00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:17.895
that all might believe through him.

117
00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:19.975
He was not the light

118
00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:25.175
but came to bear witness about the light, the true light

119
00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:28.975
which gives light to everyone was coming into the world.

120
00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:33.095
He was in the world and the world was made through him.

121
00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:35.455
Yet the world did not know him.

122
00:06:36.955 --> 00:06:40.695
He came to his own and his own people did not receive him,

123
00:06:42.155 --> 00:06:46.335
but to all who did receive him, who believed in his name,

124
00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.415
he gave the right to become children of God

125
00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:53.945
who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,

126
00:06:54.565 --> 00:06:56.865
nor of the will of man, but of God.

127
00:06:58.675 --> 00:07:02.655
And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.

128
00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:06.575
And we have seen His glory, glory as

129
00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:11.495
of the only son from the Father full of grace and truth.

130
00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:15.415
John bore witness about him and cried out.

131
00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:19.935
This was he of whom I said, he who comes after me, ranks

132
00:07:19.995 --> 00:07:22.775
before me because he was before me.

133
00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:25.945
For from his fullness.

134
00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:28.865
We have all received grace upon grace

135
00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.865
For the law was given through Moses.

136
00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.505
Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

137
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:42.355
No one has ever seen God, the only God

138
00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:44.355
who is at the father's side.

139
00:07:45.055 --> 00:07:49.795
He has made him known God.

140
00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:52.195
What a beautiful passage of scripture.

141
00:07:53.985 --> 00:07:55.595
What an incredible picture of

142
00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:57.995
who you are and what you've done.

143
00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:03.155
Lord, I pray that as we just soak in this passage

144
00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:05.675
for a few minutes, that you would change our hearts.

145
00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:12.085
You'd give us eyes to see you, our hearts

146
00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:13.845
to be open, to receive you,

147
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.335
that we would be utterly changed by this doctrine,

148
00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:23.975
this truth of God the Son incarnate,

149
00:08:27.755 --> 00:08:29.985
thank you for this God, thank you for your word.

150
00:08:29.985 --> 00:08:34.585
Thank you for changing us. Make us new even today.

151
00:08:35.165 --> 00:08:38.835
Awaken us to this in Jesus' name. Amen.

152
00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:43.635
And so not only is this passage so beautiful,

153
00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:46.595
it's also rich theologically.

154
00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:48.195
There's so much here

155
00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:49.555
and so much of understanding of

156
00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:51.675
who God is in the incarnation comes

157
00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.315
right here from this passage.

158
00:08:53.505 --> 00:08:56.205
It's highlighted here using this word,

159
00:08:57.065 --> 00:08:58.685
son Christ progression.

160
00:08:58.685 --> 00:09:00.085
So we're just gonna follow that, what

161
00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:01.405
that looks like in this passage

162
00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:02.765
and understand a little better.

163
00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:07.285
So here's the first truth is that this word is

164
00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:10.525
identified as the creator and the savior.

165
00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:14.485
This word it talks about is identified

166
00:09:14.485 --> 00:09:16.285
as the creator and the savior.

167
00:09:17.465 --> 00:09:20.165
And so right away in verse one, we find that this,

168
00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:24.245
this truth of the eternality of the word

169
00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:28.365
and the divinity of this word is eternal

170
00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:29.765
and divine.

171
00:09:30.145 --> 00:09:32.685
It echoes Genesis one, right in the beginning,

172
00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:36.045
the first few words in the beginning, same as Genesis one,

173
00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:40.885
before time and space began was the word.

174
00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.285
This means pre-existent.

175
00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:50.005
That there was never a time where the word was not.

176
00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:54.725
If you understand what I mean by that, the word has always.

177
00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:59.285
And even before time began, the word was,

178
00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:03.005
and it says the word was with God.

179
00:10:03.105 --> 00:10:05.325
Now at first glance, let's just be clear.

180
00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:07.805
That could mean there's separate entities.

181
00:10:07.905 --> 00:10:10.045
You're with someone, right?

182
00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:12.005
Except for the next phrase where it says,

183
00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:14.125
and the word was God.

184
00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:17.925
That's flashback to the trinity last week, right?

185
00:10:19.465 --> 00:10:22.165
One God, three persons, same essence.

186
00:10:23.425 --> 00:10:27.845
So the word is God, yet also was

187
00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:29.765
with the Father.

188
00:10:29.905 --> 00:10:32.765
So that you can see how this is confusing, yes,

189
00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:36.285
but the same substance we also find out in verse four,

190
00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:38.005
the word was life.

191
00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:42.245
All things were made through him.

192
00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:44.685
Nothing was made without this word.

193
00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:47.645
Now again, this is a callback

194
00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:49.325
to Genesis one in the beginning.

195
00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:51.085
So he's talking about creation.

196
00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:54.005
Do you recall how God created everything

197
00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:55.165
back in Genesis one?

198
00:10:55.825 --> 00:11:00.215
How did God do it? He spoke right?

199
00:11:00.675 --> 00:11:03.215
And God said, let there be light.

200
00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:05.015
And God said, let there be animals.

201
00:11:05.475 --> 00:11:10.095
He spoke and created, he created through the word,

202
00:11:10.955 --> 00:11:14.135
see that this is the idea we get right here.

203
00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:16.415
All things were made through the word.

204
00:11:16.415 --> 00:11:17.895
And so we're starting to build this theology

205
00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:20.175
of understanding who this word is,

206
00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:23.735
what this word even is.

207
00:11:26.005 --> 00:11:28.375
Well, he briefly mentions John the Baptist role

208
00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:29.495
proclaiming the savior.

209
00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:32.815
It wasn't the same John who wrote this gospel, by the way.

210
00:11:32.815 --> 00:11:34.015
They're different people.

211
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:36.095
He talks about John for a second,

212
00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.935
but then we catch this light idea.

213
00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:44.015
He says that John was a reflective light, that he was

214
00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:47.255
bearing witness about the true light.

215
00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.575
And so I was thinking about this. Here's a good example.

216
00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:52.055
You, you can might, you might think about this

217
00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:53.410
as like the sun and the the moon.

218
00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:56.725
So when you go out at night, especially on a full moon or

219
00:11:56.725 --> 00:12:00.005
or a large moon it, it may, it may look like

220
00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:03.885
the moon is lighting up the night sky, right?

221
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:07.165
You walk outside, it's almost daylight at times.

222
00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.525
It's so bright.

223
00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:12.445
But does that moon have any light in itself?

224
00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:17.125
Science class? No. Right?

225
00:12:17.155 --> 00:12:20.365
It's just a big hunk of rock dust.

226
00:12:22.155 --> 00:12:26.405
What it does is it reflects the light of the sun.

227
00:12:27.025 --> 00:12:28.525
And so it appears to shine,

228
00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:31.085
but it's really just reflecting the light.

229
00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:34.135
Same for us, right?

230
00:12:35.365 --> 00:12:37.415
That we are to be reflectors

231
00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:40.365
of the true light.

232
00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:43.885
Who gives light, who came into the world

233
00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:45.525
as the light at that time.

234
00:12:46.405 --> 00:12:47.625
So it's what our job is to be.

235
00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.545
We're we're just a bunch

236
00:12:49.545 --> 00:12:51.145
of big moons sitting around here, right?

237
00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:52.945
Like it's just God's delight.

238
00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:57.465
We are reflecting the light as we go into the world.

239
00:12:57.605 --> 00:13:00.225
The problem here is

240
00:13:00.225 --> 00:13:02.345
that not everyone has received the light.

241
00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:04.745
John one says even his own family.

242
00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:06.985
He says he came to his own.

243
00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:08.945
That's talking about the Jewish people, the the people

244
00:13:08.945 --> 00:13:11.865
that would have known him and should have known him.

245
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.585
He was born into that family.

246
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.905
They didn't recognize him, most people didn't.

247
00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:17.745
He was even their creator

248
00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:21.545
and they didn't have the spiritual eyes to see who he was.

249
00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:26.145
Well sadly that still happens today, doesn't it?

250
00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:31.705
People hear the gospel, they see God's good

251
00:13:31.705 --> 00:13:36.065
and gracious news, but their eyes are closed to it.

252
00:13:37.655 --> 00:13:42.575
It happens every day. They don't truly know God.

253
00:13:42.575 --> 00:13:45.415
There might even be a semblance of religious activity.

254
00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:47.295
They might be a good human being.

255
00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:51.015
They might be a decent person, but they don't know God.

256
00:13:51.015 --> 00:13:52.055
And again, did you see it here?

257
00:13:52.055 --> 00:13:55.015
Verse 11 says, they did not receive him.

258
00:13:56.955 --> 00:13:59.455
So the idea of that word receive the image

259
00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:02.575
of it is like you receiving welcoming someone

260
00:14:03.115 --> 00:14:04.935
as they are into your home.

261
00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:11.495
So when you have someone come to your door, most people

262
00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:16.375
don't know you, I'm not gonna let you in to receive

263
00:14:16.925 --> 00:14:20.775
this word would be to say, I understand who you are.

264
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:24.775
I see who you are. Come on in as you are.

265
00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:31.155
Verse 12, then repeats that phrase, adds a qualifier

266
00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:33.555
to it says those who did receive him, it says

267
00:14:34.115 --> 00:14:35.315
believed in his name.

268
00:14:36.415 --> 00:14:40.695
That's the key. That's the condition of salvation.

269
00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.895
Here it says belief

270
00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:47.375
that you see the incarnate word as he is,

271
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.495
as the creator, as the light as God.

272
00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:53.325
And you receive him as he is.

273
00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:59.005
Meaning you give him his rightful place

274
00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:01.325
as the master of your house.

275
00:15:03.255 --> 00:15:05.145
Like not just a salesman coming to your door,

276
00:15:05.335 --> 00:15:07.745
ringing the doorbell and you see him

277
00:15:07.745 --> 00:15:09.025
and you're like, okay, come on.

278
00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.145
Have a have a meal.

279
00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:13.985
You see him as the savior, as the creator king.

280
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.385
And you say, come on in. You're in charge now.

281
00:15:17.845 --> 00:15:21.625
That's what it means to receive this word

282
00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:25.625
because you believe who he is and that's what makes you.

283
00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:30.465
It says a reborn child of God. You can't be born into this.

284
00:15:30.735 --> 00:15:32.385
Like just because your parents are Christians

285
00:15:32.385 --> 00:15:33.585
does not make you a Christian.

286
00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:38.105
You can't do this by your own effort.

287
00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.005
You can't work your way into it.

288
00:15:41.195 --> 00:15:43.885
It's only by God doing it in you.

289
00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:47.485
It's what John one says.

290
00:15:47.485 --> 00:15:51.765
And so I wonder, have you received him?

291
00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:57.085
Have you believed in his name

292
00:15:57.585 --> 00:16:02.005
and invited him in as the master of the house as he is

293
00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:08.745
into your life to say You are in charge

294
00:16:09.485 --> 00:16:11.905
so that I can be a part of your family.

295
00:16:12.085 --> 00:16:15.695
Now, have you received

296
00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:18.095
him this word?

297
00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:20.855
Who is the savior? Have you received him?

298
00:16:25.415 --> 00:16:28.195
Now so far we've only looked at this kind of vague

299
00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.635
word, God language.

300
00:16:31.095 --> 00:16:33.275
That's what John one starts with.

301
00:16:33.335 --> 00:16:37.875
But verse 14, notice marks a shift in the passage to

302
00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:40.235
son, father language.

303
00:16:41.485 --> 00:16:44.755
Still the same characters, just how we meet them.

304
00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:47.155
Look again at verse 14.

305
00:16:49.895 --> 00:16:52.075
And the word, this word we've been talking about,

306
00:16:52.335 --> 00:16:55.835
the word became flesh and dwelt among us.

307
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.595
And we've seen His glory.

308
00:16:58.205 --> 00:17:02.875
Glory as of the only son from the Father full

309
00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:04.715
of grace and truth.

310
00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:11.515
So the eternal word here is signified as the son

311
00:17:12.055 --> 00:17:13.835
by taking on flesh.

312
00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:20.755
So the word that we were just kind of aware of is now said

313
00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:22.315
to be the son

314
00:17:23.775 --> 00:17:27.155
and shows that by taking on flesh again, this is

315
00:17:27.155 --> 00:17:28.315
what we call the incarnation,

316
00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:32.075
that God the Son put on a flesh suit.

317
00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:38.275
Now here is where we easily drift into the ditches

318
00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:40.755
of heresy on both sides of this.

319
00:17:41.825 --> 00:17:42.995
Like you're driving a road

320
00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:44.595
and you got ditches on both sides.

321
00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:46.035
We're trying to avoid those

322
00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:48.155
and people have done this for 2000 years,

323
00:17:48.415 --> 00:17:50.205
fallen into all kinds of things.

324
00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:52.245
And so we need to learn how to speak well

325
00:17:53.225 --> 00:17:54.765
of the incarnation just like

326
00:17:54.765 --> 00:17:55.885
we did with the Trinity last week.

327
00:17:55.895 --> 00:17:58.365
We've gotta have some good language.

328
00:17:58.365 --> 00:18:02.325
And so we, we put what we've figured out to be the best just

329
00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:03.885
by going back into the church.

330
00:18:03.915 --> 00:18:05.045
Fathers old people

331
00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:07.645
who understood this worked on it for a long time.

332
00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:10.485
We put it on your notes. Here's a great definition

333
00:18:12.145 --> 00:18:13.405
in response to heresies.

334
00:18:13.405 --> 00:18:14.805
Were popping up all over the place.

335
00:18:15.515 --> 00:18:19.005
This group of church leaders got together at Caldon in

336
00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:20.685
4 51 ad.

337
00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:25.285
So over 1500 years ago to come up with a solid foundation

338
00:18:25.505 --> 00:18:28.365
and definition of this incarnation we're talking about.

339
00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:30.455
So it'll be on the screen, it's on your notes.

340
00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:35.735
Listen to this talking about God the Son, one

341
00:18:35.735 --> 00:18:37.975
and the same son, our Lord Jesus Christ.

342
00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:42.015
The same perfect in Godhead and also perfect in manhood.

343
00:18:42.825 --> 00:18:47.135
Truly God and truly man of a reasonable soul

344
00:18:47.195 --> 00:18:51.975
and body consubstantial that word means one substance

345
00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:56.655
with the Father according to the Godhead and consubstantial.

346
00:18:56.755 --> 00:18:58.535
One substance with us according

347
00:18:58.535 --> 00:19:01.055
to the manhood means he's truly human

348
00:19:02.195 --> 00:19:06.455
in all things like unto us without sin, though

349
00:19:07.695 --> 00:19:09.935
begotten before all ages of the Father,

350
00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:11.215
according to the Godhead.

351
00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:12.975
And in these latter days for us

352
00:19:12.975 --> 00:19:16.735
and for our salvation, born of the virgin Mary, according

353
00:19:16.735 --> 00:19:21.335
to the manhood, one in the same Christ son, Lord,

354
00:19:22.085 --> 00:19:25.895
only begotten to be acknowledged in two natures

355
00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:31.095
incon, confusingly, unchangeable, indivisibly inseparably.

356
00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:35.295
The distinction of nature's being by no means taken away

357
00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:37.335
by the union, but rather the property

358
00:19:37.335 --> 00:19:39.455
of each nature being preserved

359
00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:44.975
and concurring in one person, one subsistence, not parted

360
00:19:45.075 --> 00:19:48.775
or divided into two persons, but one in the same son.

361
00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:53.215
The only begotten God, the Word the Lord Jesus Christ.

362
00:19:57.485 --> 00:19:58.495
Lots of big words there.

363
00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:01.655
I think I might have even drifted off while reading it.

364
00:20:01.875 --> 00:20:03.975
So I get, it's hard to understand,

365
00:20:05.195 --> 00:20:07.775
but this is how complicated this can get, right?

366
00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:11.895
When we try to understand God taking on flesh, like right

367
00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:16.055
yet, here's the key elements you can pick through

368
00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:18.135
that one for years.

369
00:20:18.595 --> 00:20:22.695
But the key elements are the fact that the eternal son was

370
00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:24.775
and is God perfectly

371
00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:27.575
and man perfectly,

372
00:20:28.945 --> 00:20:30.695
truly sinlessly.

373
00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:33.095
Yet he still one substance with the Father

374
00:20:35.965 --> 00:20:37.815
plus because of that,

375
00:20:38.155 --> 00:20:41.175
it means he has two natures in one person,

376
00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:43.575
fully, perfectly.

377
00:20:44.835 --> 00:20:47.015
That's something that the theologians have termed

378
00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:48.725
hypostatic union.

379
00:20:49.655 --> 00:20:52.925
Throw that one out at your next birthday party, right?

380
00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:54.725
Hypostatic union.

381
00:20:55.025 --> 00:20:59.285
It means two natures in one being, one essence.

382
00:21:01.865 --> 00:21:04.085
So here's okay, trying to simplify this.

383
00:21:04.105 --> 00:21:06.245
Let me give you just a simple way to say this.

384
00:21:09.145 --> 00:21:11.015
Think of it this way. God the Son

385
00:21:12.435 --> 00:21:16.975
merely took on another nature, a human nature.

386
00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:20.455
Like if you're gonna baseline it, level it out,

387
00:21:20.835 --> 00:21:25.335
God the Son took on another nature, a human one.

388
00:21:27.345 --> 00:21:31.095
Again, it's a mystery though, a difficult mystery,

389
00:21:31.265 --> 00:21:33.295
which is why people fall into the ditches.

390
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:35.055
I wanna give you a couple examples of

391
00:21:35.075 --> 00:21:37.095
how people have fallen into the ditches over the years

392
00:21:37.635 --> 00:21:42.415
in this doctrine of the incarnation, trying to explain this

393
00:21:43.055 --> 00:21:44.615
probably right hearted, but

394
00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:46.495
but just getting off track in some ways.

395
00:21:46.565 --> 00:21:49.255
Some would say Jesus only appeared to be human.

396
00:21:50.115 --> 00:21:53.455
He was kind of some ghost. He wasn't really human.

397
00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:55.135
We thought he was, but,

398
00:21:55.155 --> 00:21:57.815
but that that would deny the true humanity of Jesus,

399
00:21:57.825 --> 00:22:00.815
which means he couldn't then die for us and be our savior.

400
00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.975
I, last week I mentioned Arianism, which says

401
00:22:05.975 --> 00:22:08.455
that Jesus was created by God.

402
00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:11.175
Well that can't be true

403
00:22:11.175 --> 00:22:14.695
because this just said he existed from before time began.

404
00:22:14.695 --> 00:22:15.975
But, but that heresy's still alive

405
00:22:15.975 --> 00:22:17.775
and well all over the place with Mormonism

406
00:22:17.775 --> 00:22:18.855
and Jehovah's Witnesses.

407
00:22:21.955 --> 00:22:25.015
Here's others. They would say that Jesus was two nature's,

408
00:22:25.155 --> 00:22:28.615
yes, but two persons and

409
00:22:28.635 --> 00:22:30.615
and rather than one person, even to the point

410
00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:31.935
that he had two minds.

411
00:22:33.245 --> 00:22:35.775
Well when you think about that, that would be competition

412
00:22:35.805 --> 00:22:37.775
somehow happening inside him,

413
00:22:37.775 --> 00:22:40.655
which we call schizophrenia even today, right?

414
00:22:40.655 --> 00:22:42.895
Like so there's this I that can't be true of him.

415
00:22:42.955 --> 00:22:46.055
Two minds, no Still.

416
00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:47.815
Others would say that the divine

417
00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:52.095
and human nature somehow went into the Cuisinart blender

418
00:22:52.095 --> 00:22:55.215
and came out as one, a different form of nature somehow

419
00:22:56.015 --> 00:22:58.095
a third type of nature.

420
00:22:58.235 --> 00:23:00.975
Now, I like the fact that we want to try to keep unity here,

421
00:23:00.975 --> 00:23:03.575
but we also have to keep the two natures separate, divine

422
00:23:03.575 --> 00:23:07.815
and human still.

423
00:23:07.815 --> 00:23:09.975
Others say that Christ only had one nature

424
00:23:10.075 --> 00:23:14.815
or he had only one will that still denies that he's both God

425
00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:19.505
and man Here, here's even more like you can see

426
00:23:19.505 --> 00:23:20.865
how far we can get off track, right?

427
00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:22.665
Some people, we even say that, that Joseph

428
00:23:22.765 --> 00:23:25.265
and Mary had this, they they conceived this baby

429
00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:28.665
and that the, the God the son then just overtook the baby

430
00:23:29.385 --> 00:23:31.145
whenever the baby was conceived

431
00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:36.065
or even that, that he found some guy named Jesus 30

432
00:23:36.065 --> 00:23:38.185
years later and overtook that body

433
00:23:38.285 --> 00:23:40.985
and became Jesus this son that we know

434
00:23:41.085 --> 00:23:44.385
or even that that Jesus, yeah, was kind of something.

435
00:23:44.445 --> 00:23:48.885
But then at the baptism is when he became God the Son

436
00:23:51.435 --> 00:23:52.785
again, we're trying to understand this,

437
00:23:52.805 --> 00:23:54.545
but you can't explain it apart from

438
00:23:54.545 --> 00:23:56.145
what God's word has just said to us.

439
00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:58.585
These are all heresies,

440
00:24:00.805 --> 00:24:05.025
But there's one that we might even drift into inadvertently,

441
00:24:05.085 --> 00:24:07.625
but, but it's done by misinterpreting scripture.

442
00:24:09.975 --> 00:24:12.225
It's Philippians chapter two which says

443
00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:14.625
that Christ emptied himself.

444
00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:18.025
It's what we call the kenosis theory.

445
00:24:18.215 --> 00:24:20.345
That word kenosis is the Greek word for empty.

446
00:24:22.725 --> 00:24:25.425
And we say that in a way that that implies that

447
00:24:26.285 --> 00:24:28.945
for somewhere in some way he's not God anymore.

448
00:24:29.895 --> 00:24:32.505
He's he emptied himself of his divinity so

449
00:24:32.505 --> 00:24:33.945
that he could become man.

450
00:24:33.945 --> 00:24:36.065
Now, now we have to be very clear about this.

451
00:24:37.695 --> 00:24:40.385
When God the Son stepped out of eternity

452
00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:44.625
and took on flesh, he did not lose anything.

453
00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:46.825
That's right. Right?

454
00:24:47.045 --> 00:24:51.435
You hear that he did not lose anything.

455
00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:54.755
He didn't set aside his divinity in any way.

456
00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:57.075
If we start getting down that road, we're walking into a lot

457
00:24:57.075 --> 00:24:58.275
of those things we just talked about.

458
00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:01.995
Because you remember Colossians two, nine,

459
00:25:02.495 --> 00:25:05.235
we spent like 20 years in Colossians last year, right?

460
00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:09.955
It seems so Colossians two nine, the whole fullness

461
00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:13.155
of deity dwells in him bodily.

462
00:25:14.025 --> 00:25:18.395
It's in Jesus the whole fullness of deity.

463
00:25:18.395 --> 00:25:20.595
So here again, the healthier way to think about it is

464
00:25:20.595 --> 00:25:23.835
that God the Son, merely added on humanity.

465
00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:25.555
He didn't lose anything, set anything aside.

466
00:25:25.555 --> 00:25:29.875
He just took on something. He didn't change in any way.

467
00:25:30.175 --> 00:25:33.155
He just set aside what we might think the full glory

468
00:25:33.155 --> 00:25:35.915
of sitting at the throne of God forever.

469
00:25:36.775 --> 00:25:40.275
He set that aside, humbled himself,

470
00:25:40.655 --> 00:25:42.035
became a servant.

471
00:25:42.185 --> 00:25:44.595
Even to the point of shameful death on a cross.

472
00:25:44.975 --> 00:25:47.995
That's what he set aside, that he emptied himself

473
00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:50.955
of a glorified position so

474
00:25:50.955 --> 00:25:54.475
that he could come live in obedience, die on the cross,

475
00:25:55.045 --> 00:25:56.235
accomplish redemption.

476
00:25:57.695 --> 00:25:59.425
There's nothing about his divinity that changed.

477
00:25:59.485 --> 00:26:00.585
He didn't set anything aside.

478
00:26:00.885 --> 00:26:04.385
He set aside this position, which we read Philippians two.

479
00:26:04.685 --> 00:26:06.785
He did empty himself of that position.

480
00:26:06.805 --> 00:26:10.785
But what happened next? He goes back to the position again.

481
00:26:12.485 --> 00:26:16.305
So it was merely that glory that he was longing to receive.

482
00:26:16.305 --> 00:26:19.225
Again, John 17, he's talking about this idea of saying, God,

483
00:26:19.305 --> 00:26:21.105
I need that position back.

484
00:26:23.025 --> 00:26:24.225
Glorify me again in that sense.

485
00:26:24.225 --> 00:26:28.105
And he did through this humbling exaltation.

486
00:26:29.485 --> 00:26:32.145
So this idea, again, I'm gonna say it all the time,

487
00:26:32.265 --> 00:26:33.465
incarnation's really hard.

488
00:26:34.165 --> 00:26:36.545
Yes, but it is essential.

489
00:26:38.755 --> 00:26:40.235
I love how it was said that God,

490
00:26:40.235 --> 00:26:43.275
the Son taking on flesh will remain for eternity.

491
00:26:43.585 --> 00:26:45.165
The most profound miracle

492
00:26:45.745 --> 00:26:48.285
and the most profound mystery in all the universe.

493
00:26:50.835 --> 00:26:53.205
Some miracle and a mystery.

494
00:26:53.465 --> 00:26:56.605
Yet we can learn to speak well of it.

495
00:26:59.255 --> 00:27:01.515
We can understand it so we can grow and love.

496
00:27:01.515 --> 00:27:03.395
And so we're, we're walking this track.

497
00:27:03.575 --> 00:27:06.795
Now we've seen the word. Now we've seen the Son.

498
00:27:06.945 --> 00:27:08.755
It's developing. Watch this.

499
00:27:08.815 --> 00:27:11.755
Now let's go back and read John one 14 through 18.

500
00:27:12.145 --> 00:27:14.075
It's continuing to develop this watch

501
00:27:15.255 --> 00:27:17.275
the word became flesh dwelled among us.

502
00:27:17.275 --> 00:27:18.435
We've seen his glory.

503
00:27:18.725 --> 00:27:21.395
Glory as of the only son from the Father full

504
00:27:21.395 --> 00:27:22.675
of grace and truth.

505
00:27:22.825 --> 00:27:24.635
John bore witness cried out.

506
00:27:24.635 --> 00:27:27.435
This was he of whom I said He comes after me, ranks

507
00:27:27.435 --> 00:27:31.195
before me 'cause he was before me for from his fullness.

508
00:27:31.195 --> 00:27:32.875
We've all received grace. Upon grace.

509
00:27:33.215 --> 00:27:34.315
The law was given through Moses.

510
00:27:34.405 --> 00:27:38.355
Grace and truth came through. Here we go, Jesus Christ.

511
00:27:39.735 --> 00:27:40.875
No one's ever seen God,

512
00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:42.955
the only God who's at the father's side.

513
00:27:43.135 --> 00:27:45.795
He has made him known.

514
00:27:47.695 --> 00:27:51.955
So one thing that John clarifies for us here is

515
00:27:51.955 --> 00:27:55.155
that this son, there's a relationship that's begotten

516
00:27:56.225 --> 00:27:57.315
with the Father.

517
00:27:57.815 --> 00:28:00.315
You don't really see it here. It's in the background.

518
00:28:00.315 --> 00:28:02.995
Greek word. It's the begottens.

519
00:28:02.995 --> 00:28:04.555
Now you saw that when I read the definition

520
00:28:04.555 --> 00:28:05.635
earlier, the creed.

521
00:28:06.615 --> 00:28:08.395
Now you've probably heard that word before

522
00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:11.875
because it's in the verse

523
00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:15.195
that most people have memorized if they're at all

524
00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:19.875
around church, John three 16, not in every translation,

525
00:28:19.875 --> 00:28:22.195
but the King James version says it.

526
00:28:23.615 --> 00:28:26.475
You know the the one that's on that sign

527
00:28:26.475 --> 00:28:28.675
behind the field goal at every football game.

528
00:28:31.175 --> 00:28:32.515
No, I put the Steelers up there.

529
00:28:32.515 --> 00:28:34.235
That's an honor of B deal by the way.

530
00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:37.675
Uh, sorry that they're losing in that scene, but it's okay.

531
00:28:38.215 --> 00:28:40.195
Um, but John three 16, right?

532
00:28:40.195 --> 00:28:43.035
The one that most people memorize first in the King James.

533
00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:45.395
I remember Awana growing up. I remember it this way.

534
00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:47.955
For God so loved the world

535
00:28:48.585 --> 00:28:52.275
that he gave his only begotten son

536
00:28:53.425 --> 00:28:58.355
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish

537
00:28:58.935 --> 00:29:01.795
but have everlasting life.

538
00:29:03.355 --> 00:29:04.795
I dunno why when I say that I feel like I need

539
00:29:04.795 --> 00:29:06.315
to say it in a British accent or something.

540
00:29:07.185 --> 00:29:10.675
Whosoever believeth that sounded more Boston. I don't know.

541
00:29:10.735 --> 00:29:14.715
Uh, okay, but what does begotten even mean?

542
00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:18.245
Like we say it but we don't even know what it means.

543
00:29:19.595 --> 00:29:22.045
Well the word itself means to give rise to

544
00:29:22.105 --> 00:29:23.125
or to bring about.

545
00:29:23.615 --> 00:29:27.205
Often referring to a mother and a father begetting a child.

546
00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:29.125
Again, we don't talk like that very often,

547
00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:30.965
but here in the original Greek language,

548
00:29:30.985 --> 00:29:35.725
the word monogenist, it's translated as only, that's

549
00:29:35.725 --> 00:29:38.485
where you see it in John one only or only son

550
00:29:38.545 --> 00:29:41.205
or only begotten John three 16.

551
00:29:43.275 --> 00:29:44.615
So when we're talking about the trinity

552
00:29:44.835 --> 00:29:47.735
and the forgottenness of the sun,

553
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:50.255
it does not mean created.

554
00:29:51.735 --> 00:29:53.715
We saw that in the nice scene creed last week.

555
00:29:54.955 --> 00:29:56.555
Begotten not made.

556
00:29:58.745 --> 00:30:00.835
What it's talking about, and this is hard,

557
00:30:00.855 --> 00:30:04.195
but it's talking about the relationship eternally

558
00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:06.075
between the two persons

559
00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:07.955
of the Godhead we're talking about here, the father

560
00:30:08.495 --> 00:30:09.755
and the son.

561
00:30:10.705 --> 00:30:11.795
There's a begotten

562
00:30:12.775 --> 00:30:15.875
to the son from the father.

563
00:30:16.485 --> 00:30:19.875
Again, not created, always existed in three persons,

564
00:30:20.135 --> 00:30:21.475
but there's a relationship.

565
00:30:21.475 --> 00:30:22.755
That's what this is talking about.

566
00:30:22.785 --> 00:30:24.275
It's John one 18 right here.

567
00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:26.555
It says, no one has ever seen God.

568
00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:30.275
The only God that's the begotten word we just said.

569
00:30:31.005 --> 00:30:34.195
Who's at the father's side? He has made him known.

570
00:30:35.215 --> 00:30:38.035
So this is the idea the son is begotten.

571
00:30:38.335 --> 00:30:41.635
The only meaning there's a relationship

572
00:30:41.635 --> 00:30:43.435
that's a high level.

573
00:30:45.655 --> 00:30:47.475
But, but that's the idea for us.

574
00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:48.795
As we understand this,

575
00:30:48.855 --> 00:30:51.155
we can know nothing about the three persons

576
00:30:51.155 --> 00:30:53.515
of the Trinity apart from God revealing it in his word.

577
00:30:54.255 --> 00:30:55.555
And this is how he said it.

578
00:30:55.775 --> 00:30:59.355
The Father and the Son, there's a relationship there to us.

579
00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:01.555
They're identical, but he says no,

580
00:31:01.835 --> 00:31:02.835
actually the son is begotten.

581
00:31:04.085 --> 00:31:05.825
The spirit is proceeding from,

582
00:31:05.885 --> 00:31:07.025
you could say it that way as well.

583
00:31:08.175 --> 00:31:11.425
There's a relationship in this trinity.

584
00:31:11.485 --> 00:31:16.385
So the word of God is the son of God, third

585
00:31:16.685 --> 00:31:18.225
or second person of the trinity.

586
00:31:18.685 --> 00:31:20.665
But who then? So, so we're trying

587
00:31:20.665 --> 00:31:22.465
to come down the levels here.

588
00:31:22.725 --> 00:31:24.625
Who do we then meet this son to be?

589
00:31:24.845 --> 00:31:27.025
Who does John say was before him?

590
00:31:28.315 --> 00:31:31.105
Verse 17 says, Jesus Christ.

591
00:31:33.885 --> 00:31:37.865
So he's tying all this together, right?

592
00:31:37.925 --> 00:31:41.665
The word to the Son, to the Christ, this eternal word

593
00:31:41.665 --> 00:31:45.665
of God, the Son of God took on flesh in his mission

594
00:31:46.245 --> 00:31:48.345
to save us and we now know him

595
00:31:48.525 --> 00:31:50.025
as the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

596
00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:55.785
This is all part of the eternal nature of God.

597
00:31:55.895 --> 00:31:58.785
Finally showing up to us in Jesus.

598
00:31:58.925 --> 00:32:01.625
That's the verse 18, only God who makes God known.

599
00:32:01.925 --> 00:32:04.145
That's the one who gives us grace upon grace.

600
00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:06.505
That's the one who shows us God's glory.

601
00:32:09.565 --> 00:32:11.705
And this is why all these rocks tied together.

602
00:32:12.005 --> 00:32:15.505
The only all that trinity stuff from last week.

603
00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:19.065
That's how Jesus himself can say in John 14,

604
00:32:19.215 --> 00:32:22.185
whoever has seen me has seen the Father.

605
00:32:24.615 --> 00:32:27.875
He says, I am in the Father and the Father is in me.

606
00:32:31.605 --> 00:32:33.435
Jesus, if he's just a man that doesn't work.

607
00:32:33.615 --> 00:32:35.755
But Jesus, the son of God, the word of God.

608
00:32:35.775 --> 00:32:38.115
That's how it all works out together.

609
00:32:38.115 --> 00:32:39.605
That's why we talk about God,

610
00:32:39.605 --> 00:32:42.605
the Son taking on flesh in the incarnation.

611
00:32:43.145 --> 00:32:47.445
We say He just added on a nature. He didn't lose anything.

612
00:32:47.625 --> 00:32:48.885
He didn't let anything go.

613
00:32:49.265 --> 00:32:53.325
He added on this human nature for us.

614
00:32:55.205 --> 00:32:56.905
And here's why this is really important, because

615
00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:59.825
otherwise Luke eight doesn't make any sense

616
00:33:01.845 --> 00:33:03.185
Unless we say it this way.

617
00:33:03.185 --> 00:33:04.465
Listen to what this says.

618
00:33:04.645 --> 00:33:07.745
One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples

619
00:33:07.745 --> 00:33:09.065
and he said to them, let's go across

620
00:33:09.085 --> 00:33:10.105
to the other side of the lake.

621
00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:12.865
And so they set out and as he sa, as they sailed,

622
00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:16.825
he fell asleep and a windstorm came down on the lake

623
00:33:16.825 --> 00:33:19.065
and they were filling with water and they were in danger.

624
00:33:19.805 --> 00:33:21.625
And they went and woke him saying, master,

625
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:22.905
master we're perishing.

626
00:33:23.205 --> 00:33:26.985
And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves

627
00:33:27.045 --> 00:33:29.345
and they ceased and there was a calm.

628
00:33:30.445 --> 00:33:33.545
He said to them, where's your faith? And they were afraid.

629
00:33:33.565 --> 00:33:36.345
And they marveled saying to one another who then is this,

630
00:33:36.735 --> 00:33:41.225
that he commands even winds and water and they obey him.

631
00:33:44.185 --> 00:33:48.275
That scene shows us the two natures in Christ, right?

632
00:33:50.065 --> 00:33:51.645
You've got his human nature

633
00:33:51.735 --> 00:33:54.445
where he fully identifies worth us, where he's

634
00:33:54.905 --> 00:33:57.645
so tired he falls asleep in a storm.

635
00:33:59.695 --> 00:34:02.315
Now this boat, not like a cruise ship

636
00:34:02.445 --> 00:34:04.115
where you're down in the bowels of it

637
00:34:04.115 --> 00:34:06.035
and you're safe, like this was an open,

638
00:34:07.135 --> 00:34:09.115
simple boat fishing vessel

639
00:34:09.495 --> 00:34:12.475
and this thing, just imagine you got wind and waves

640
00:34:12.475 --> 00:34:15.755
and thunder and, and he's just, he's just sleeping.

641
00:34:16.705 --> 00:34:20.355
Like how do you water flashes? That's how tired he was.

642
00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:28.775
Yet notice his divine nature is not diminished

643
00:34:28.795 --> 00:34:33.275
in any way because he's God.

644
00:34:33.735 --> 00:34:36.675
He stood up, said a word to the wind

645
00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:38.035
and the waves and they stopped.

646
00:34:40.435 --> 00:34:42.425
He spoke, right?

647
00:34:43.005 --> 00:34:46.585
So human nature like us,

648
00:34:47.605 --> 00:34:48.305
divine nature

649
00:34:49.805 --> 00:34:52.675
God, who is this?

650
00:34:52.705 --> 00:34:57.515
They asked. They were stunned. Well, we know who he is.

651
00:34:58.575 --> 00:35:01.155
The second person of the trinity, the eternal word of God,

652
00:35:01.295 --> 00:35:03.595
the eternal son of God who took on flesh

653
00:35:03.615 --> 00:35:05.155
as Jesus Christ to save us.

654
00:35:05.155 --> 00:35:09.395
That's who He is. And listen, that is

655
00:35:09.395 --> 00:35:12.675
what brings us the most benefit.

656
00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:14.835
That's what brings God the most glory.

657
00:35:14.835 --> 00:35:16.115
Because verse 14 says,

658
00:35:16.115 --> 00:35:17.915
the word became flesh and dwelt among us.

659
00:35:17.925 --> 00:35:19.035
We've seen his glory.

660
00:35:19.205 --> 00:35:21.275
Glory is the only son from the Father full

661
00:35:21.275 --> 00:35:22.835
of grace and truth.

662
00:35:23.025 --> 00:35:26.435
That grace and truth is what comes from God.

663
00:35:26.495 --> 00:35:30.515
It comes through Jesus Christ. That's who we know him to be.

664
00:35:30.835 --> 00:35:34.355
This Messiah, he's glorified as salvation. Something.

665
00:35:34.355 --> 00:35:37.685
The law through through Moses could never do only

666
00:35:37.685 --> 00:35:41.405
through God's grace, which remember is undeserved favor.

667
00:35:41.435 --> 00:35:43.085
Like you get a gift at your birthday.

668
00:35:43.085 --> 00:35:45.885
You don't deserve that. God just gives it to you.

669
00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:49.805
That's grace and truth, which is the ultimate standard

670
00:35:49.865 --> 00:35:51.005
of what is right and wrong.

671
00:35:51.795 --> 00:35:55.165
That he himself is the standard of how things ought to be.

672
00:35:55.385 --> 00:35:57.645
How we ought to be. And here's the problem.

673
00:35:58.315 --> 00:36:01.165
When we hear truth, we quickly figure out we don't measure

674
00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.445
up to that standard of truth.

675
00:36:02.445 --> 00:36:06.055
Right? He came full of truth.

676
00:36:06.475 --> 00:36:09.175
If we broken one of his commands, we've broken all of them

677
00:36:09.195 --> 00:36:10.215
and we're guilty of it.

678
00:36:10.215 --> 00:36:13.895
That's why we need not only truth, we need grace.

679
00:36:16.835 --> 00:36:21.455
And listen, if, if our biggest need was information,

680
00:36:22.355 --> 00:36:24.295
God would have sent an educator.

681
00:36:26.535 --> 00:36:28.315
If our biggest need was technology,

682
00:36:28.455 --> 00:36:30.035
God would've sent a scientist.

683
00:36:31.775 --> 00:36:34.555
If our biggest need was finances,

684
00:36:34.655 --> 00:36:36.275
God would've sent an economist.

685
00:36:38.225 --> 00:36:40.005
If our biggest need was pleasure,

686
00:36:40.025 --> 00:36:41.605
God would've sent an entertainer.

687
00:36:43.425 --> 00:36:45.805
But because our biggest need was

688
00:36:45.805 --> 00:36:47.925
forgiveness, God sent a savior.

689
00:36:49.835 --> 00:36:52.685
Amen. The Son in the flesh

690
00:36:53.385 --> 00:36:56.365
who would truly take on our humanity so

691
00:36:56.365 --> 00:37:00.005
that he could feel every temptation that we feel

692
00:37:00.345 --> 00:37:02.085
yet remain sinless in it.

693
00:37:02.225 --> 00:37:05.845
So he could be the adequate sacrifice as the bridge

694
00:37:05.995 --> 00:37:10.365
between divinity and humanity to cover our sin

695
00:37:10.785 --> 00:37:14.685
and make a way to be both

696
00:37:15.665 --> 00:37:16.765
the at toner

697
00:37:17.705 --> 00:37:21.845
and the atonement, right?

698
00:37:21.985 --> 00:37:26.205
He is the one who gives salvation

699
00:37:27.425 --> 00:37:30.325
and he is the means to get salvation.

700
00:37:32.525 --> 00:37:35.705
God and man in one. No one else could have done that.

701
00:37:35.735 --> 00:37:38.305
Only God himself can provide it.

702
00:37:38.305 --> 00:37:39.825
That's what the word of God came to do.

703
00:37:39.825 --> 00:37:42.265
That's what the Son came to do.

704
00:37:42.745 --> 00:37:44.785
'cause Jesus was not merely a good man.

705
00:37:44.965 --> 00:37:46.505
He was not merely a good example.

706
00:37:46.645 --> 00:37:49.625
He was not merely a good teacher, a good prophet

707
00:37:49.735 --> 00:37:51.905
what every everybody else would say about him.

708
00:37:52.085 --> 00:37:56.465
No, he was and is the son of God who took on flesh

709
00:37:56.885 --> 00:38:00.905
to make God known to us, to to show us

710
00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:04.705
the love of God better than anything else ever could. Amen.

711
00:38:05.255 --> 00:38:09.585
Hall, For God so loved the world

712
00:38:10.935 --> 00:38:12.025
that he gave his son.

713
00:38:12.775 --> 00:38:14.585
It's because of his heart, his love.

714
00:38:15.245 --> 00:38:19.425
Yet remember John one says, we must receive him.

715
00:38:21.495 --> 00:38:23.075
We must believe in his name.

716
00:38:23.075 --> 00:38:26.835
That's the only way you can become a child of God, a part

717
00:38:26.835 --> 00:38:28.555
of this eternal family of God.

718
00:38:28.665 --> 00:38:30.475
It's through believing.

719
00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:33.595
And listen, if you have not received him

720
00:38:33.615 --> 00:38:34.675
yet, what's holding you back?

721
00:38:39.325 --> 00:38:42.815
This God is not some force out there.

722
00:38:45.285 --> 00:38:46.975
He's the God who draws near,

723
00:38:48.955 --> 00:38:50.295
not just kind of close.

724
00:38:50.915 --> 00:38:53.455
He draws near to say, I came to you.

725
00:38:55.855 --> 00:38:58.095
I took on flesh for you.

726
00:39:00.525 --> 00:39:02.695
He's not far from each one of us.

727
00:39:02.695 --> 00:39:05.575
Acts 17 says, receive him.

728
00:39:09.455 --> 00:39:10.915
But if you have received Him, church,

729
00:39:13.055 --> 00:39:15.635
if you have received him, then my prayer today has been

730
00:39:15.635 --> 00:39:20.355
that we would be reawaken to the greatness of our God

731
00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:23.555
and Savior, that God would do this

732
00:39:25.995 --> 00:39:27.415
all this for us.

733
00:39:29.315 --> 00:39:30.695
Is that not stunning?

734
00:39:32.645 --> 00:39:35.575
Well, I think we should sing quickly in light of this.

735
00:39:35.755 --> 00:39:37.975
And so I'm gonna invite every, get them out here as quickly

736
00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:40.735
as possible and the 15 people it takes

737
00:39:40.735 --> 00:39:41.975
to get me off the stage here.

738
00:39:42.235 --> 00:39:45.215
So but, but this is the idea, right?

739
00:39:46.835 --> 00:39:50.015
Two Corinthians 5 21, he made him

740
00:39:50.115 --> 00:39:51.895
to be sin who knew no sin.

741
00:39:52.035 --> 00:39:54.655
So that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

742
00:39:56.205 --> 00:39:59.375
That Christ came, the son of God came so

743
00:39:59.375 --> 00:40:01.575
that we could be made new.

744
00:40:02.475 --> 00:40:06.615
And it's his merit, his effort, his salvation

745
00:40:06.645 --> 00:40:07.895
that makes the way for us.
