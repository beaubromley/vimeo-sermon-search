1
00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:51.945
So lemme just get this outta the way now.

2
00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:56.905
Um, yes, I'm limping and yes, I'm sitting.

3
00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:02.065
Uh, so yesterday I was literally just standing on the court

4
00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:05.985
but rebounding for my son and I turned around

5
00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:07.745
and my knee buckles inward.

6
00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.585
And so I don't know what's going on yet.

7
00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:13.625
We'll figure it out. I'm only 41.

8
00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:15.705
I didn't feel like I've hit the age yet

9
00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:16.985
where I get hurt standing.

10
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.385
So here we are.

11
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:21.225
Um,

12
00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:26.065
Doesn't get any better, does it, Greg?

13
00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:28.225
Okay, great. Thank you.

14
00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:32.265
I know it's pretty minor compared to what I know some

15
00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:35.065
of you're going through right now, so I, I get that.

16
00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:36.665
But we'll see how this week goes.

17
00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:39.105
Um, what, what it did, this was interesting.

18
00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:40.425
I was wrestling with that this morning.

19
00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:43.785
It's revealed some selfishness in my heart

20
00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:46.145
because we had a ski trip planned in a couple weeks.

21
00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:51.145
And, and so it's like, why am I more upset about that than

22
00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:54.425
other things that I should be upset about?

23
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:56.625
You know, just a little selfishness in my heart there.

24
00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:59.785
So appreciate your prayers for all that as we go forward.

25
00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:02.465
But, uh, I need to sit down for at least today.

26
00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:04.745
We'll see how that goes. But it's still a great Sunday.

27
00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:06.945
We're kicking off a new sermon

28
00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:08.225
series called First Things First.

29
00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.185
And, uh, maybe you're new to our church today.

30
00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:12.625
We're grateful that you would choose to,

31
00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.665
to take this step to be with us.

32
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:17.305
Uh, let me just say I'm proud of you for taking that step.

33
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.305
It's a big deal as you're trying

34
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.985
to start some new rhythms in life, uh, this new year, maybe.

35
00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:23.345
Uh, we're thankful for you.

36
00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:25.305
Don't worry about six months from now,

37
00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:26.545
like that's the long way off.

38
00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:27.905
Just the next step. That's all

39
00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:28.945
you need to worry about today.

40
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:30.865
We'd love to help you with that.

41
00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:32.265
So, uh, there's QR code

42
00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:34.785
and then there's a new here area out there if you

43
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.425
want to let us know who you are.

44
00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.585
So we can help you in that way as we go.

45
00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:42.545
But what do we mean by first things first as we talk about

46
00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:43.985
that series?

47
00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:47.825
Well, as you saw, our version involves rocks and sand.

48
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.025
By the way. It's amazing how focused the little boys are

49
00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:53.705
right now as we go through this series.

50
00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:55.585
They saw that and we see this rock here.

51
00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:57.105
It's not a potato, by the way.

52
00:02:57.725 --> 00:02:59.525
Um, but,

53
00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:01.885
but with these first things, what we're talking about,

54
00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.925
what we're wanting to do is go back

55
00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:05.565
to the basics theologically.

56
00:03:06.865 --> 00:03:11.605
So Jude one three calls this The faith Once

57
00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:13.645
for All Delivered to the Saints.

58
00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:18.685
He says, it's our common salvation as he called it, meaning

59
00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:22.365
the basic core of our beliefs as Christians.

60
00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:26.365
Like what makes us the doctrines that make us

61
00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:28.365
distinctly Christian.

62
00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:34.565
In fact, it's what Ephesians chapter four, uh, verses four

63
00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:38.925
through six describe, there is one body,

64
00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:42.285
one spirit, just as you were called to the one hope

65
00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:43.685
that belongs to your call.

66
00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:47.965
One lord, one faith, one baptism, one God,

67
00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:51.525
and Father of all whose overall through all and in all.

68
00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:54.925
So that's the idea we're gonna get to.

69
00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:56.125
And we need these reminders

70
00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:57.645
'cause there's a lot of religions out there

71
00:03:57.645 --> 00:04:00.405
that will teach similar things to what we talk about

72
00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:04.765
as Christians when you talk about being unselfish

73
00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:07.925
or loving others or that there's an afterlife

74
00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:11.005
or that there's a God who helps them if they do the

75
00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:12.125
right kinds of things.

76
00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:17.125
But if we believe that Jesus is the only way to God,

77
00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:22.645
if we believe that, that he is that, then we need

78
00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:23.765
to understand why.

79
00:04:25.945 --> 00:04:29.685
And then we also need to understand what those beliefs are

80
00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:31.805
that we would say are true.

81
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.925
Who even is this God that we talk about?

82
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:40.925
That's what we're gonna get to because here's the reality.

83
00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:45.565
Every one of us, every person in the world is a theologian,

84
00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:48.205
has beliefs about God.

85
00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:50.005
They're either believing the right

86
00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:53.365
and true things that we get from God's word,

87
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:57.845
or they're filling the gaps with their own made up versions

88
00:04:57.845 --> 00:04:59.325
of what they hope God is like

89
00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:01.165
or what they want him to be like.

90
00:05:03.665 --> 00:05:05.725
And so we're gonna look at what God's word says.

91
00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:08.405
Now, we're not gonna be able to say everything about each

92
00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:10.085
one of these beliefs.

93
00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:13.645
I only have a, a short few minutes on a Sunday.

94
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.325
Uh, that's why just as a side note, on Wednesday nights,

95
00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:20.325
we're gonna come back together as one

96
00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:22.005
of our equipping classes on Wednesdays.

97
00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:23.045
We're calling it Digging Deeper

98
00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:26.565
where we're gonna take this topic of whatever Sunday was.

99
00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:30.045
Dig deeper into it, do q and a talk a lot more.

100
00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:31.645
We'll have a lot more time there.

101
00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:33.765
So if you're interested in, in more about

102
00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:37.325
what we're saying each Sunday, Wednesday nights that class,

103
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:38.765
it will be a good one for you.

104
00:05:39.945 --> 00:05:42.325
But our hope here in this series is

105
00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.565
that whether this is something you're familiar with already,

106
00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:47.365
like all these doctrines are gonna be old hat to you,

107
00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:50.245
or maybe you're completely new to this.

108
00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:53.045
You've never heard any of these things before.

109
00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:55.725
Our hope in this is that you will come to know God

110
00:05:56.705 --> 00:06:00.965
and you'll come to rejoice your in your faith more than ever

111
00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:05.045
before, simply because we know who he is better than before.

112
00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:09.165
Here's how we're also gonna take this

113
00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:10.245
toward the end of the series.

114
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.405
And really at times throughout, you'll hear me

115
00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:14.765
and others do this, we're gonna touch on some,

116
00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:18.685
some lower tier Christian beliefs that,

117
00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:21.445
that Christians hold at times can and

118
00:06:21.445 --> 00:06:23.645
and do hold things that are not essential.

119
00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:25.805
Like we're gonna major on the majors, but,

120
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.325
but really there are some things that we need to talk about

121
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:30.685
that are not as essential.

122
00:06:30.685 --> 00:06:32.405
We're gonna see a couple things that'll make our church

123
00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:37.565
distinct, but we're also going to see how we should interact

124
00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:41.885
with other Christians who also agree on the major things,

125
00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:44.405
but differ a little bit on some

126
00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:46.205
of the less important things.

127
00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:51.445
Even in this room today. We hopefully all agree on the big

128
00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:55.565
rock doctrines of the Christian beliefs that we would die

129
00:06:55.585 --> 00:06:57.645
for, that people in history have died for.

130
00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:02.165
But there's even some smaller rocks

131
00:07:02.165 --> 00:07:04.325
and sand among us in this room.

132
00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:06.925
The way we see things a little bit differently, things

133
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:09.045
that are not gospel level issues, right?

134
00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:12.005
Things that are not as clear in scripture

135
00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:17.285
or even things that we can have freedom on the way we live

136
00:07:17.345 --> 00:07:18.965
and choose to live our lives.

137
00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:22.365
That's why when we look at the differences among those kinds

138
00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:24.365
of things, that's why there's denominations.

139
00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:26.965
That's why there's different churches.

140
00:07:27.215 --> 00:07:28.285
We're not all the same.

141
00:07:29.595 --> 00:07:31.565
There's even differing opinions on some

142
00:07:31.565 --> 00:07:34.485
of those lifestyle choices we would make as far as

143
00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:36.205
what we choose in our lives.

144
00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:40.925
And so we have to ask how do we, how do we disagree?

145
00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:44.885
Well, as believers, how do we work with people

146
00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:47.005
that might differ on a couple little things,

147
00:07:47.025 --> 00:07:49.285
but what we, we agree on the major things?

148
00:07:49.465 --> 00:07:50.485
How can we do that?

149
00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:52.405
Well, we're gonna do some of

150
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.845
that towards the end of this series.

151
00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:56.485
But I wanna come back to, uh, as you saw in the video,

152
00:07:56.555 --> 00:07:58.445
this jar that's sitting right here,

153
00:07:58.445 --> 00:07:59.565
it's the one from the video.

154
00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:03.205
When I talked about all those, what we call second

155
00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:06.165
and third tier issues, beliefs,

156
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:09.525
we we're classifying those as the smaller rocks

157
00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:10.845
and the sand.

158
00:08:11.955 --> 00:08:13.245
When you think about those things

159
00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:14.285
and you think about a jar,

160
00:08:14.545 --> 00:08:17.805
we can't put those things in the jar first, right?

161
00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:22.605
Like you, you think about, you put the sand in first.

162
00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:24.645
You put the smaller rocks in first.

163
00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:28.245
Then when you want to go put the big rocks in,

164
00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:29.965
they won't fit right.

165
00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:32.685
It would fill up most of the jar

166
00:08:32.685 --> 00:08:35.445
and then the big rocks don't actually fit in.

167
00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:38.285
So what we have to do is we have to put the primary things,

168
00:08:38.425 --> 00:08:39.885
the first things in first,

169
00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:43.085
the most important things in first.

170
00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:47.805
Because if we focus on these lesser issues like preferential

171
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:52.405
things in our lives, or church practice concerns first,

172
00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:54.965
or even political divides first,

173
00:08:55.225 --> 00:09:00.205
we put those things in first that begins to crowd out all

174
00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:04.925
of the big rock doctrines that we must have in the jar.

175
00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:08.325
We've gotta put the big rocks in first.

176
00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:10.205
Then all that other stuff fits

177
00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:13.645
around those you see.

178
00:09:16.465 --> 00:09:20.885
Now, full disclosure as we head into this series, I am

179
00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.165
intimidated by this

180
00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:30.925
because it, it is difficult to study

181
00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:34.645
these massive concepts

182
00:09:35.505 --> 00:09:37.245
and try to communicate them clearly

183
00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:38.605
in a few minutes on a Sunday.

184
00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:41.125
These are things that have been debated

185
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.245
for thousands of years.

186
00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:45.765
Talked about and written books upon books.

187
00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.605
And I'm gonna give you 30 minutes, right?

188
00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:51.605
And so I'm intimidated by this.

189
00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:53.965
That's why I'm leaning on a ton of resources.

190
00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:56.445
So many people in the background helping

191
00:09:57.115 --> 00:09:58.285
develop these things.

192
00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.165
So just know this, that as we walk this road,

193
00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:02.845
we're walking this road together.

194
00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:07.405
Like I'm, I said I'm intimidated, yes, but also excited

195
00:10:07.405 --> 00:10:09.925
because I'm gonna learn so much myself

196
00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:13.645
as I study these things again,

197
00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:15.845
to grow in our love for the Lord.

198
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.845
And so as we grow in this, as we understand more,

199
00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:20.525
let's also though walk humbly.

200
00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:23.405
'cause again, like I said, this has

201
00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:24.485
been debated for thousands of years.

202
00:10:24.545 --> 00:10:28.965
And so we need to walk humbly realizing where we are limited

203
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:33.845
and we need to walk in love where we, yes,

204
00:10:33.845 --> 00:10:36.525
we're gonna hold our beliefs firmly,

205
00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:41.525
but we also need to respect others' dignity when

206
00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:42.645
we disagree on some things.

207
00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:48.245
That's our hope as we go into this. So I hope you're ready.

208
00:10:48.305 --> 00:10:50.005
Are you ready? We're about

209
00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:52.605
to dive in over the next few weeks to this.

210
00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:57.245
So here is our, our first big rock doctrine

211
00:10:57.715 --> 00:10:58.925
that we put in the jar.

212
00:10:59.175 --> 00:11:00.925
First is revelation.

213
00:11:03.105 --> 00:11:04.325
Not the last book of the Bible.

214
00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:06.845
Don't think we're going there, right? That's not it.

215
00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:10.005
This is God's self revelation.

216
00:11:10.345 --> 00:11:13.445
His revealing of who he is to us.

217
00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:17.885
'cause here's the reality, unless God tells us about

218
00:11:18.035 --> 00:11:20.125
himself, we don't know anything about him.

219
00:11:21.665 --> 00:11:22.765
We know very little about him.

220
00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:26.005
I should say, as you'll see here, we can't know him

221
00:11:27.225 --> 00:11:31.565
in any other way unless he tells us who he is

222
00:11:31.705 --> 00:11:32.885
and how we can know him.

223
00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:35.645
That's why we start with this.

224
00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:37.085
We don't start with the doctrine of God.

225
00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:39.525
We start with the doctrine of revelation that he needs

226
00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:40.565
to tell us who he is.

227
00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:42.485
And thankfully he has.

228
00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:46.005
And so turn with me to Psalm 19 to help us see that

229
00:11:47.215 --> 00:11:48.925
Psalm 19, to help us see the how

230
00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:52.125
and the why that he has revealed himself.

231
00:11:52.655 --> 00:11:57.005
Psalm 19. Now this psalm was written by David, a man

232
00:11:57.005 --> 00:11:58.605
who knew God's law very well,

233
00:11:58.625 --> 00:11:59.685
but also spent a ton

234
00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:01.245
of time when he was a young shepherd out

235
00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:02.765
underneath the stars at night.

236
00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:05.445
And you'll actually see both aspects of

237
00:12:05.445 --> 00:12:06.725
that here in this psalm.

238
00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:09.045
So look at Psalm 19 with me.

239
00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:10.685
You'll be on the screen if you don't have it.

240
00:12:10.685 --> 00:12:12.365
There's a copy of God's word underneath one

241
00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:13.525
of the seats around you.

242
00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:15.445
Here's Psalm 19.

243
00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:19.885
The heavens declare the glory of God.

244
00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:23.085
The sky above proclaims his handiwork.

245
00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:26.165
Day to day, pours out speech, night

246
00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:27.525
to night reveals knowledge.

247
00:12:27.525 --> 00:12:28.925
There is no speech,

248
00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:31.845
nor are there words whose voice is not heard.

249
00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:34.805
Their voice goes out through all the earth

250
00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:38.245
and the words to the end of the world in them.

251
00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:39.925
He set a tent for the sun,

252
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:42.685
which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber.

253
00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:45.405
Like a strong man runs its course with joy.

254
00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:47.925
It's rising is from the end of the heavens.

255
00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.085
It's circuit to the end of them.

256
00:12:50.105 --> 00:12:52.285
And there's nothing hidden from its heat.

257
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:57.725
The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.

258
00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:01.285
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple,

259
00:13:01.905 --> 00:13:04.245
the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

260
00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:09.285
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes,

261
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:11.925
the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

262
00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:15.725
The rules of the Lord are true and altogether righteous.

263
00:13:16.675 --> 00:13:18.685
More to be desired are they than gold.

264
00:13:18.795 --> 00:13:22.445
Much even much fine gold, sweeter also than honey

265
00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:23.925
and drippings of the honeycomb.

266
00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:27.445
Moreover by them is your servant warned.

267
00:13:27.445 --> 00:13:29.445
In keeping them there is great reward

268
00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:32.205
who can discern his errors.

269
00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:34.445
Declare me innocent from hidden faults.

270
00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:38.485
Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.

271
00:13:38.745 --> 00:13:40.445
Let them not have dominion over me,

272
00:13:40.715 --> 00:13:42.005
then I shall be blameless

273
00:13:42.025 --> 00:13:44.085
and innocent of great transgression.

274
00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:46.805
Let the words of my mouth

275
00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:51.005
and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight.

276
00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:52.845
Oh Lord, my rock

277
00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:57.085
and my eye, redeemer God, that's our prayer today

278
00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:01.845
as we meditate on your word for the next few minutes,

279
00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:07.085
as we sing with our mouths in a moment, we,

280
00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:09.405
we pray that that would be acceptable.

281
00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:10.485
We know there's only one way.

282
00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:13.645
We'll see that here, for that to be acceptable.

283
00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:16.125
But God, our heart cry is to know you better.

284
00:14:16.185 --> 00:14:18.605
And I pray we would see that through Psalm 19 today.

285
00:14:21.155 --> 00:14:23.445
Open our eyes and our ears to see

286
00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:25.605
and hear what you want us to see and hear today,

287
00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:27.605
and to be doers of the word,

288
00:14:28.185 --> 00:14:30.925
not hearers only in Jesus' name.

289
00:14:32.075 --> 00:14:36.665
Amen. So did you see the two

290
00:14:37.265 --> 00:14:39.185
distinct sections of Psalm 19?

291
00:14:41.135 --> 00:14:43.305
They correspond with what is often described

292
00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:46.585
as the two modes of God's self revelation.

293
00:14:47.865 --> 00:14:48.865
I think there's three, actually.

294
00:14:48.865 --> 00:14:50.145
We'll get to that a little bit later.

295
00:14:50.325 --> 00:14:53.205
But, but first what we see is God's general

296
00:14:53.295 --> 00:14:54.685
revelation of himself.

297
00:14:55.865 --> 00:14:57.125
That's the first part here.

298
00:14:57.235 --> 00:15:00.765
Genesis is the story of creation.

299
00:15:00.835 --> 00:15:03.885
This kind of parallels that verses one through six

300
00:15:03.885 --> 00:15:06.325
of Psalm 19 shows us God's general

301
00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:08.885
revelation of himself.

302
00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:10.565
His natural revelation.

303
00:15:10.965 --> 00:15:13.005
I mean, just look at the language, right? You see it.

304
00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:17.685
Verse one, the heavens constantly declare the glory of God.

305
00:15:17.785 --> 00:15:21.685
How glorious God is the sky above it proclaims,

306
00:15:22.265 --> 00:15:24.405
it shows God's creative handiwork.

307
00:15:25.695 --> 00:15:30.405
Verse two, each day pours out a description of God.

308
00:15:30.425 --> 00:15:31.525
It it's like in the morning,

309
00:15:31.545 --> 00:15:34.325
it freely bubbles out of the sky.

310
00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:38.165
In fact, that word, that word can be used for belch as well.

311
00:15:38.165 --> 00:15:39.605
But we're not gonna go there today. Okay?

312
00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:41.005
Uh, but that's the idea.

313
00:15:41.145 --> 00:15:45.925
It pours out this description of God each night.

314
00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:51.165
Also reveals, it tells, it declares knowledge about God.

315
00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:55.165
This is just creation declaring.

316
00:15:55.185 --> 00:15:56.805
And then verse three supports

317
00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:59.205
that the nature's tell telling God's glory.

318
00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:02.205
It says it's all audible everywhere

319
00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:07.085
that those, it says words.

320
00:16:07.275 --> 00:16:09.045
It's not words, it's not audible, right?

321
00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:12.765
It's these words are going out to the ends of the earth

322
00:16:12.985 --> 00:16:15.245
to declare who God is.

323
00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:17.645
Just like the sun's heat covers the whole.

324
00:16:19.505 --> 00:16:24.405
And this is objectively true, right? This is just nature.

325
00:16:24.475 --> 00:16:27.925
When we look at creation, we can't help

326
00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:32.925
but be stunned at how great God really is.

327
00:16:35.475 --> 00:16:36.815
You know the song, right?

328
00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:40.565
I don't wanna sing a solo, so you

329
00:16:40.565 --> 00:16:41.845
better sing with me on this, right?

330
00:16:42.185 --> 00:16:43.565
How great thou art?

331
00:16:45.065 --> 00:16:47.485
Oh Lord, my God, please say,

332
00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:50.885
when I in awesome wonder,

333
00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:56.765
consider all the world's thy

334
00:16:56.775 --> 00:16:58.005
hands have made.

335
00:16:59.845 --> 00:17:01.925
I see the stars.

336
00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:06.365
I hear the rolling thunder.

337
00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:12.405
Thy power throughout the universe

338
00:17:13.395 --> 00:17:17.565
displayed, then sings my soul,

339
00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:22.485
my savior, your God to thee.

340
00:17:24.225 --> 00:17:26.205
How great thou are.

341
00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:33.005
How great thou then sings my

342
00:17:33.235 --> 00:17:35.885
soul, my savior,

343
00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:38.485
your God to thee.

344
00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:41.805
How great thou

345
00:17:46.355 --> 00:17:50.645
thou see, that's

346
00:17:50.645 --> 00:17:53.525
what God's general revelation is intended to do.

347
00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:57.805
It's intended to humble us before him.

348
00:17:59.715 --> 00:18:02.085
Like how do you look around at the creation

349
00:18:02.305 --> 00:18:04.325
and say, it's all about me.

350
00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.405
How? How do I do that? Right? I love what John Piper said.

351
00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:13.805
He said, it's all about the greatness of God,

352
00:18:14.265 --> 00:18:16.245
not the significance of man.

353
00:18:18.185 --> 00:18:20.045
God made man small

354
00:18:20.545 --> 00:18:23.885
and the universe big to say something about himself.

355
00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:29.365
You see that, right? And we know that intuitively.

356
00:18:29.365 --> 00:18:31.605
But again, like how often do we still

357
00:18:32.235 --> 00:18:35.405
make ourselves the center of the universe?

358
00:18:36.665 --> 00:18:40.725
I'm so tempted to revolve everything around me.

359
00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:42.365
My thoughts are often all about me.

360
00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:45.685
My my actions are, are trying to work things

361
00:18:45.825 --> 00:18:46.925
for my own advantage.

362
00:18:47.205 --> 00:18:50.525
I get mad when my plans are interrupted. Hello. Right?

363
00:18:54.895 --> 00:18:56.195
But let's just stop for a second

364
00:18:56.255 --> 00:18:58.795
and consider how small we really are.

365
00:19:02.835 --> 00:19:06.855
One person out of 8 billion people now

366
00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:12.655
on a planet that is 25,000 miles around

367
00:19:15.675 --> 00:19:20.215
in a galaxy that is 87,000 light years across,

368
00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:27.895
which is one of millions of galaxies in the universe.

369
00:19:31.995 --> 00:19:33.615
God made man small

370
00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:38.335
and the universe big to say something about himself.

371
00:19:39.535 --> 00:19:44.335
I To humble us, to remind us

372
00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:47.015
that he is God and we're not.

373
00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:50.935
And listen, let's just, that's good news, right?

374
00:19:53.215 --> 00:19:55.015
I, I don't wanna be in charge of this whole thing.

375
00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.335
I don't want any of you to be in charge of this whole thing.

376
00:19:59.045 --> 00:20:01.655
This thing's way too big for God is,

377
00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:05.375
and that's why Romans 1136 says this, for from him

378
00:20:05.835 --> 00:20:09.695
and through him and to him are all things

379
00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:12.175
to him be glory forever.

380
00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:17.055
Amen. But here's, here's one

381
00:20:17.055 --> 00:20:18.615
of the criticisms we get about this.

382
00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:22.695
We're not just reading our knowledge of God.

383
00:20:22.915 --> 00:20:24.775
Now back into creation.

384
00:20:25.795 --> 00:20:28.455
That's what's often said, no.

385
00:20:28.565 --> 00:20:30.775
This what we're talking about is objectively

386
00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:33.255
and universally present.

387
00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:37.615
Whether anyone who recognizes it or acknowledges it

388
00:20:37.675 --> 00:20:40.215
or believes it or not, it is there.

389
00:20:42.265 --> 00:20:45.415
Which is why the Apostle Paul can say

390
00:20:45.725 --> 00:20:49.405
that all people are rightly condemned by their sin.

391
00:20:49.405 --> 00:20:51.125
Whether they've heard the gospel or not.

392
00:20:52.925 --> 00:20:57.205
'cause that's what Romans one 18 through 32 says,

393
00:20:59.305 --> 00:21:02.485
for the wrath of God, there's only wrath of God towards sin.

394
00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:06.485
So the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all

395
00:21:06.805 --> 00:21:10.005
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who

396
00:21:10.225 --> 00:21:13.005
by their unrighteousness, suppress the truth.

397
00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:18.645
Here's why. For what can be known about God is plain to them

398
00:21:19.395 --> 00:21:21.245
because God has shown it to them.

399
00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:24.845
For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power.

400
00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:27.965
Divine nature have been clearly perceived

401
00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:31.805
ever since the creation of the world

402
00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:34.605
in the things that have been made.

403
00:21:34.705 --> 00:21:37.085
So there are without excuse for,

404
00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:39.605
although they knew God, they did not honor him as God

405
00:21:39.625 --> 00:21:40.845
or give thanks to him,

406
00:21:41.305 --> 00:21:43.365
but they became futile in their thinking.

407
00:21:43.585 --> 00:21:47.525
And their foolish hearts were darkened, claiming to be wise,

408
00:21:47.635 --> 00:21:48.805
they became fools

409
00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:52.645
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God

410
00:21:52.785 --> 00:21:55.965
for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals

411
00:21:56.025 --> 00:21:57.325
and creeping things.

412
00:21:58.225 --> 00:22:00.925
See, in our sin, we reject

413
00:22:01.435 --> 00:22:04.165
what is plain about God in creation.

414
00:22:04.195 --> 00:22:06.845
Instead turning to idols.

415
00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:10.725
He goes on in chapter two to describe

416
00:22:10.825 --> 00:22:15.205
how we reject even God's law that's written on our hearts,

417
00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:19.085
that there's an intuitive nature, sense of God.

418
00:22:19.305 --> 00:22:23.445
God designed us, designed creation to know that he's there.

419
00:22:25.735 --> 00:22:27.835
That's why when you look at every culture,

420
00:22:29.185 --> 00:22:30.875
there's some sense of religion.

421
00:22:31.945 --> 00:22:34.675
There's some sense of a God, right?

422
00:22:35.185 --> 00:22:37.795
It's because it's in here. It's out there. We see it.

423
00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:41.115
We know intuitive. Something is there. But here's the thing.

424
00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:46.555
Romans three goes on to say that just becoming more aware

425
00:22:46.695 --> 00:22:48.795
of God is not the solution.

426
00:22:51.615 --> 00:22:54.515
In other words, there's no natural theology

427
00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:55.995
that can save a person.

428
00:22:59.175 --> 00:23:02.155
The only solution is by putting on what John Calvin called,

429
00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:04.075
the spectacles of faith.

430
00:23:05.575 --> 00:23:07.555
The glasses of faith.

431
00:23:07.655 --> 00:23:10.595
That's why we talked about general revelation so far.

432
00:23:10.705 --> 00:23:14.275
General revelation must always be kept in submission to

433
00:23:14.275 --> 00:23:16.755
what we saw next in Psalm 19.

434
00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:21.915
Remember God's special revelation of himself.

435
00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:24.955
So we saw God's general revelation.

436
00:23:25.425 --> 00:23:28.715
Then we also, the shift in verse seven led us

437
00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:32.875
to now see God's special revelation of himself.

438
00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:36.595
Because you saw David start talking

439
00:23:36.595 --> 00:23:37.675
about something different, right?

440
00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:40.035
Creation, creation, creation, creation.

441
00:23:40.705 --> 00:23:44.555
Then he started talking about God's law, the testimony

442
00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:47.205
of the Lord, his precepts, his commandments, his rules.

443
00:23:47.555 --> 00:23:50.485
What he's referencing there is what he had at the time,

444
00:23:50.775 --> 00:23:54.485
which we know as the Torah, the first five books

445
00:23:54.865 --> 00:23:55.885
of the Old Testament.

446
00:23:57.945 --> 00:24:00.725
And so Israel at the time, all through history from

447
00:24:00.725 --> 00:24:05.245
that time, they saw that the Torah as God's revelation

448
00:24:05.265 --> 00:24:09.085
of himself through Moses, that God said, here's who I am,

449
00:24:09.085 --> 00:24:10.445
here's what you're supposed to do.

450
00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:14.485
But then over time it was added to developed.

451
00:24:14.825 --> 00:24:16.805
As they added historical books,

452
00:24:16.995 --> 00:24:20.765
they added prophecies from the prophets, wisdom literature.

453
00:24:21.215 --> 00:24:25.325
Jesus and the apostles in their timeframe looked back

454
00:24:25.425 --> 00:24:28.965
and they referenced all of that as scripture.

455
00:24:30.655 --> 00:24:33.765
Everything that we have as our Old Testament

456
00:24:34.305 --> 00:24:37.245
was the scriptures that Jesus and the apostles looked at

457
00:24:37.245 --> 00:24:38.525
and said, that's God's word.

458
00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:42.045
That's God's self revelation.

459
00:24:44.845 --> 00:24:48.865
And so then among the early church, the apostles

460
00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:51.945
who had been with Jesus, they were recording Jesus's life.

461
00:24:52.215 --> 00:24:53.665
They were recording his ministry.

462
00:24:53.815 --> 00:24:56.065
They were recording the letters that they were writing

463
00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:58.465
to the churches under the inspiration of God's spirit.

464
00:24:58.725 --> 00:25:03.305
And what they did is even that collection began to be seen

465
00:25:03.445 --> 00:25:08.305
as God's self revelation, his authoritative word as well.

466
00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:13.745
That's where we then get the 66 books that we now have

467
00:25:14.295 --> 00:25:17.105
that we call God's word as well.

468
00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:19.185
And again, this was necessary, right?

469
00:25:20.815 --> 00:25:24.425
Because we needed him to tell us about himself

470
00:25:24.605 --> 00:25:26.105
or else we wouldn't know him.

471
00:25:27.625 --> 00:25:30.125
We could get some general ideas from creation,

472
00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:35.045
but we couldn't know him unless he told us about himself.

473
00:25:35.105 --> 00:25:36.765
But the question is, how did he do that?

474
00:25:38.105 --> 00:25:41.165
How do we know that this is God's word?

475
00:25:42.715 --> 00:25:44.885
Well, he did it through people.

476
00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:48.565
He spoke through people.

477
00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:51.045
This is what two Peter one verse 20

478
00:25:51.145 --> 00:25:54.445
and 21 says, that no prophecy

479
00:25:54.445 --> 00:25:57.805
of scripture comes from someone's own interpretation.

480
00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:02.645
For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man.

481
00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:05.485
But men spoke from God

482
00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:08.805
as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

483
00:26:11.175 --> 00:26:15.995
God breathed out his word by leading people.

484
00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:17.555
Even Peter himself.

485
00:26:17.555 --> 00:26:21.275
Later in chapter three, he saw Paul, his writings

486
00:26:21.535 --> 00:26:22.955
as scripture already.

487
00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:24.995
He's a contemporary. They knew each other.

488
00:26:25.695 --> 00:26:27.995
And he looked at Paul and he said, man, God was speaking

489
00:26:27.995 --> 00:26:30.235
through Paul, this circumstances around here.

490
00:26:31.895 --> 00:26:33.675
God spoke and this is scripture.

491
00:26:33.895 --> 00:26:35.955
So notice something about scripture is

492
00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:39.355
that it wasn't merely a person coming up with this stuff.

493
00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:42.835
This was God speaking through people.

494
00:26:44.945 --> 00:26:47.685
Now, he used their personality, he used their context.

495
00:26:48.265 --> 00:26:52.045
But God, superintendent, every word,

496
00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:56.245
meaning every word in scripture is there

497
00:26:56.245 --> 00:27:00.465
because God wanted it to be there, even

498
00:27:01.165 --> 00:27:06.065
by ensuring that we now have what he wants us to have today.

499
00:27:09.245 --> 00:27:12.385
And listen, this even includes everyone's favorite

500
00:27:12.455 --> 00:27:13.905
abandoned ship moment.

501
00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:16.705
As you're reading through the Bible, the genealogies,

502
00:27:19.175 --> 00:27:20.585
some of you're already, you know,

503
00:27:20.725 --> 00:27:22.665
you're a week in committed to it.

504
00:27:24.065 --> 00:27:26.865
February 8th, I'm done, right?

505
00:27:27.135 --> 00:27:28.425
Because you hit those things

506
00:27:28.525 --> 00:27:30.905
and you're like, why did, why did God put those in there?

507
00:27:31.015 --> 00:27:32.145
Well, first of all, he didn't

508
00:27:32.145 --> 00:27:33.225
put them in there to punish us.

509
00:27:36.775 --> 00:27:39.265
They're an accurate historical record,

510
00:27:39.535 --> 00:27:41.105
certainly at the very least.

511
00:27:42.885 --> 00:27:46.545
But think about how God used families

512
00:27:46.545 --> 00:27:47.785
to bring about the Messiah.

513
00:27:50.485 --> 00:27:54.785
He fulfilled prophecies through lineages, genealogies

514
00:27:55.445 --> 00:27:56.985
of people, families,

515
00:27:58.765 --> 00:28:02.345
and all of it points us to God's providence

516
00:28:03.445 --> 00:28:05.105
in the history of redemption.

517
00:28:06.715 --> 00:28:09.685
That that it shows us how he brought about the good news

518
00:28:09.685 --> 00:28:12.285
of Jesus at just the right time.

519
00:28:16.535 --> 00:28:18.355
All that together, when you look at that,

520
00:28:18.505 --> 00:28:20.395
they're talking about the Old Testament

521
00:28:20.855 --> 00:28:22.475
and how it developed to bring about

522
00:28:22.545 --> 00:28:25.755
that moment 2000 years ago when Jesus came.

523
00:28:26.935 --> 00:28:29.795
All of that together is why Paul says in two Timothy three

524
00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:31.755
15 that the sacred writings,

525
00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:33.275
he's talking about the Old Testament.

526
00:28:33.275 --> 00:28:38.035
At the time, the scriptures were able to make you wise

527
00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:40.835
for salvation through Christ Jesus.

528
00:28:43.385 --> 00:28:47.435
That this special revelation of God is able

529
00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:50.395
to make you wise for salvation

530
00:28:52.165 --> 00:28:53.855
through faith in Christ.

531
00:28:53.875 --> 00:28:55.735
In other words, they show us the way,

532
00:28:57.935 --> 00:28:59.225
even the Old Testament,

533
00:29:00.225 --> 00:29:03.065
'cause that's what He's talking about, it points

534
00:29:03.165 --> 00:29:04.425
us to Jesus.

535
00:29:06.315 --> 00:29:09.065
God's special revelation is to reveal

536
00:29:10.025 --> 00:29:11.705
salvation to his people.

537
00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:17.785
That's why one of our anchoring, one of our values,

538
00:29:17.925 --> 00:29:18.945
is anchoring truth.

539
00:29:20.535 --> 00:29:24.185
That we prioritize God's word in everything we do

540
00:29:24.185 --> 00:29:27.505
because it is what reveals who he is.

541
00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:30.985
And it reveals salvation to us.

542
00:29:34.045 --> 00:29:37.985
But listen, that's why scripture is so critical for each

543
00:29:38.125 --> 00:29:40.545
of us to dig into ourselves.

544
00:29:41.595 --> 00:29:46.285
Because you remember how Psalm 19 describes its effect, how?

545
00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:50.525
How it affects us. It's true. It's right in everything.

546
00:29:50.925 --> 00:29:53.285
Absolutely. But the scriptures also, it says

547
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:55.125
revives the soul.

548
00:29:56.225 --> 00:29:59.885
It makes wise the simple. It rejoices the heart.

549
00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:02.845
It enlightens the eyes. It endures forever.

550
00:30:03.305 --> 00:30:05.445
It can even keep us from sinning

551
00:30:08.345 --> 00:30:10.765
how again, because God breathed it out.

552
00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:14.325
God inspired it to teach us about himself,

553
00:30:14.535 --> 00:30:18.325
about his character in order to rebuke us when we sin,

554
00:30:18.585 --> 00:30:20.765
to correct us the right direction,

555
00:30:20.865 --> 00:30:23.725
and to train us how to live a life that's godly.

556
00:30:25.085 --> 00:30:26.985
That's all from his words.

557
00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:29.945
So that you heard it read earlier, two Timothy three 17,

558
00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:34.305
the man of God may be complete, fully equipped

559
00:30:34.925 --> 00:30:36.025
for every good work.

560
00:30:39.845 --> 00:30:41.045
I, I can't say this enough.

561
00:30:42.565 --> 00:30:44.605
Scripture is essential

562
00:30:45.625 --> 00:30:47.725
for our growth in Jesus Christ.

563
00:30:51.635 --> 00:30:52.805
It's how we see him,

564
00:30:55.045 --> 00:30:58.675
which second Corinthians three says, when we see him, that's

565
00:30:58.675 --> 00:31:00.675
how we're changed into his image.

566
00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:04.265
So it's only through his word.

567
00:31:04.365 --> 00:31:07.945
We cannot know God, how he desires us

568
00:31:08.005 --> 00:31:10.145
to know him any other way.

569
00:31:10.205 --> 00:31:11.385
We must hunger

570
00:31:11.725 --> 00:31:15.225
and thirst for his word in here, of course,

571
00:31:15.845 --> 00:31:17.065
but also on our own.

572
00:31:19.865 --> 00:31:22.425
I love how Pastor Javier from Nicaragua said it

573
00:31:22.615 --> 00:31:23.625
just a few weeks ago.

574
00:31:25.165 --> 00:31:28.385
He said, the word of God must be the bread of life,

575
00:31:29.125 --> 00:31:30.105
not the cake of

576
00:31:30.545 --> 00:31:34.265
birthdays, right?

577
00:31:34.765 --> 00:31:37.785
Tastes good every year,

578
00:31:38.655 --> 00:31:40.105
once a year.

579
00:31:40.615 --> 00:31:42.585
It's not the way it's supposed to be. It's the word.

580
00:31:43.175 --> 00:31:48.145
It's the bread of life daily sustaining us. We need it.

581
00:31:48.605 --> 00:31:53.505
Ask God for it. There's one more

582
00:31:53.505 --> 00:31:54.505
piece of the puzzle here though.

583
00:31:55.565 --> 00:31:59.145
And we saw that God shows his special power,

584
00:31:59.325 --> 00:32:00.905
his eternal power, his divine nature

585
00:32:00.905 --> 00:32:02.305
through general revelation.

586
00:32:03.645 --> 00:32:06.345
And he lets us know who he is through special revelation.

587
00:32:08.565 --> 00:32:13.105
But that special revelation only points us toward salvation.

588
00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:20.465
And so God himself took it one step further in his

589
00:32:21.345 --> 00:32:23.545
personal revelation of himself,

590
00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:29.625
Personal, that he actually came,

591
00:32:32.445 --> 00:32:33.905
not just told us about himself.

592
00:32:34.005 --> 00:32:37.185
He actually came. You remember how David closed Psalm 19?

593
00:32:38.205 --> 00:32:40.285
It was this messianic connote.

594
00:32:40.865 --> 00:32:43.805
He says, oh Lord, Yahweh, my rock

595
00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:46.165
and my redeemer.

596
00:32:48.725 --> 00:32:50.075
David knew he needed a savior.

597
00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:54.245
God had given his good word.

598
00:32:54.835 --> 00:32:57.525
He'd pointed his people to salvation, even the Old Testament

599
00:32:57.765 --> 00:32:58.805
by grace through faith.

600
00:32:59.235 --> 00:33:01.685
He'd shown them who he is, his character.

601
00:33:01.705 --> 00:33:04.765
But then what God would do later if a thousand years

602
00:33:04.765 --> 00:33:07.725
after David is he would actually show up.

603
00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:13.285
Here's who I am, here's what I'm about. But now I am here.

604
00:33:13.315 --> 00:33:15.045
This is what we call the incarnation.

605
00:33:15.275 --> 00:33:17.645
What we just celebrated a couple weeks ago with Christmas.

606
00:33:17.825 --> 00:33:21.925
The incarnation where God, the Son, took on flesh

607
00:33:22.615 --> 00:33:26.685
personally, came born as a baby, lived, died,

608
00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:28.765
resurrected, ascended.

609
00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:31.125
And he was personal. He was real.

610
00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:32.925
He wasn't a ghost, he was real.

611
00:33:35.985 --> 00:33:38.485
The Apostle John described it so well,

612
00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:40.285
his experience with Jesus.

613
00:33:40.515 --> 00:33:42.845
This is first John chapter one.

614
00:33:44.505 --> 00:33:46.325
He says that which was from the beginning,

615
00:33:46.615 --> 00:33:50.005
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,

616
00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:51.485
which we looked upon

617
00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:56.245
and have touched with our hands concerning the word of life.

618
00:33:57.345 --> 00:34:01.965
That's Jesus. The life was made manifest, evident, visible.

619
00:34:02.465 --> 00:34:05.605
And we have seen it testified to it proclaimed

620
00:34:05.605 --> 00:34:08.725
to you the eternal life, which was with the Father.

621
00:34:08.945 --> 00:34:12.365
And it was made manifest to us that which we've seen

622
00:34:12.485 --> 00:34:15.485
and heard, we proclaim also to you so

623
00:34:15.485 --> 00:34:18.005
that you too may have fellowship with us.

624
00:34:19.225 --> 00:34:21.285
Indeed, our fellowship is with the Father

625
00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:23.285
and with his son Jesus Christ.

626
00:34:27.175 --> 00:34:30.435
So get this. Not only did God

627
00:34:31.425 --> 00:34:36.275
give us his word to direct us toward the way

628
00:34:36.295 --> 00:34:41.235
of salvation, he also gave us the actual way

629
00:34:41.735 --> 00:34:45.235
of salvation capital W Jesus Christ,

630
00:34:47.215 --> 00:34:51.075
who John 14 says, I am the way, the truth in the life.

631
00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.155
No one comes to the Father except through me.

632
00:34:53.375 --> 00:34:56.835
Not only the way we see in scripture the way came

633
00:34:58.055 --> 00:34:59.795
and made the way for us.

634
00:34:59.865 --> 00:35:04.635
John one 14, the eternal word became flesh

635
00:35:04.975 --> 00:35:06.075
and dwelt among us.

636
00:35:07.015 --> 00:35:09.075
And we've seen His glory, glory

637
00:35:09.095 --> 00:35:11.835
as the only son from the Father full of grace

638
00:35:11.975 --> 00:35:16.275
and truth, full of saving grace, full of gospel truth.

639
00:35:16.575 --> 00:35:19.595
And he did all of that church to save us.

640
00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:25.715
His personal revelation was to save us.

641
00:35:27.935 --> 00:35:29.115
He came to be

642
00:35:29.455 --> 00:35:32.515
and to do what David foresaw back in Psalm 19,

643
00:35:33.015 --> 00:35:34.235
to be the rock.

644
00:35:34.415 --> 00:35:38.485
One Corinthians 10, four says that Jesus is to be what?

645
00:35:38.485 --> 00:35:43.445
Then Galatians four says the redeemer, listen to this.

646
00:35:47.235 --> 00:35:49.245
When the fullness of time had come,

647
00:35:50.465 --> 00:35:54.645
God sent forth his son, born of woman born under the law to

648
00:35:55.465 --> 00:35:58.325
redeem those who were under the law so

649
00:35:58.325 --> 00:36:01.405
that we might receive adoption as sons.

650
00:36:04.585 --> 00:36:09.405
Listen, this redeemer is the only way you

651
00:36:09.405 --> 00:36:12.405
and I can be acceptable in God's sight.

652
00:36:15.865 --> 00:36:17.515
It's not merely by being a better person

653
00:36:20.135 --> 00:36:23.395
by changing this words that you used to say or

654
00:36:23.495 --> 00:36:24.555
or that thought process.

655
00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:25.835
You change those things.

656
00:36:25.945 --> 00:36:30.475
It's not merely by out balancing your good over your bad

657
00:36:30.545 --> 00:36:31.875
because you can't,

658
00:36:36.095 --> 00:36:39.595
no one can climb a ladder of good works to get to God.

659
00:36:44.075 --> 00:36:46.215
But here's the thing, I know how quickly

660
00:36:46.815 --> 00:36:49.455
I default back into that mode of thinking.

661
00:36:53.725 --> 00:36:57.055
Like I know the gospel,

662
00:36:58.295 --> 00:37:02.655
I preach the gospel, but my default

663
00:37:02.845 --> 00:37:05.135
operating system is works.

664
00:37:07.955 --> 00:37:12.215
And so when I sin, I run away from my heavenly Father.

665
00:37:12.215 --> 00:37:16.215
Instead of run to him, I hide sin.

666
00:37:16.935 --> 00:37:19.335
I don't confess to brothers and sisters 'cause I'm ashamed.

667
00:37:22.095 --> 00:37:25.315
Why I if this God

668
00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:30.395
who is love has revealed himself in love to pay for

669
00:37:30.395 --> 00:37:34.715
that sin, then why do I still function the old way if I have

670
00:37:34.715 --> 00:37:37.235
a redeemer who's done it all and covered it all?

671
00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.915
Why do I still function as if I'm under the works?

672
00:37:45.145 --> 00:37:47.245
Listen, friends, this is why we study theology.

673
00:37:49.555 --> 00:37:51.765
It's not just cold and academic.

674
00:37:52.315 --> 00:37:55.765
It's meant to help us know who he is,

675
00:37:58.155 --> 00:38:01.575
to build and deepen the relationship that he has

676
00:38:02.095 --> 00:38:03.095
graciously given us.

677
00:38:05.435 --> 00:38:09.535
We don't deserve it. And yet he did it anyway.

678
00:38:09.675 --> 00:38:14.135
And so my prayer today is that we would see him

679
00:38:14.955 --> 00:38:16.615
as the glorious creator,

680
00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:20.035
yes, that he is.

681
00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:24.675
He's good to tell us about himself and who he is,

682
00:38:24.675 --> 00:38:27.275
and we would long to know more about that.

683
00:38:27.855 --> 00:38:30.875
But that also that he has been gracious enough

684
00:38:31.415 --> 00:38:34.355
to become like us in order to save us.

685
00:38:38.005 --> 00:38:41.785
May that truth, those truths stir our affections more

686
00:38:41.785 --> 00:38:45.065
and more for him simply

687
00:38:45.065 --> 00:38:49.935
because we know who he is now by his self revelation.
