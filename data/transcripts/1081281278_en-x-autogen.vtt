1
00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:35.875
Well, good morning again, church, it's great to see you.

2
00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:38.355
Uh, if you're new to our church, we're glad you are here.

3
00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:39.395
We would love to meet you.

4
00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:41.955
Uh, there's a couple ways to be able to do that.

5
00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:43.115
You can just come say hello.

6
00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:44.995
We are happy to do that always, of course.

7
00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:46.955
But there's also new here area out there.

8
00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:48.395
If you wanna go introduce yourself out there,

9
00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:49.675
that'd be great as well.

10
00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.275
Uh, we are this morning continuing in our new series called

11
00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:55.795
Rail Realigned.

12
00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:57.035
This series, we're walking

13
00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:58.715
through Romans chapter 12 together,

14
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:00.555
where we're being challenged with

15
00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:02.835
what a transformed life in Christ

16
00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:06.275
actually looks like as we get into it.

17
00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.275
Today, though, most of you know, I'm a sports guy,

18
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:09.915
like every one of 'em, it doesn't matter.

19
00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:11.155
I'll watch curling.

20
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:14.155
Uh, it's just that football is probably my favorite.

21
00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:17.875
Uh, it's something that has been part of what I do, uh,

22
00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:20.395
in my life, of course, but mostly it's

23
00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:23.955
because I see it as the ultimate team game, uh,

24
00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:25.075
the ultimate team game.

25
00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:27.035
And it's hard for one player to dominate.

26
00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.475
You don't win alone in any way,

27
00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.395
and you can't hide any weak links.

28
00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:34.355
Everyone must play their part

29
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.835
or the first picture happens, right?

30
00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:39.275
And I, I appreciate, uh, Brandon probably appreciates

31
00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:40.715
that one of the Steelers, right?

32
00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:43.515
But, uh, everyone must play their part.

33
00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:44.915
Everyone must defer to one another.

34
00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.475
You can't be just selfish in it.

35
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:48.995
Well, it's similar to what we're gonna study today

36
00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:51.275
as we look at God's word.

37
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:54.955
This chapter teaches us about serving one another.

38
00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.115
And we'll see how critical it is that everyone

39
00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:01.635
does their part within the body of Christ.

40
00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:07.675
Plus how we must be humble in order to maintain the unity

41
00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:09.235
of the Spirit in the bond of peace,

42
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:11.235
as Ephesians four puts it.

43
00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:14.035
And so if you're not already there, turn with me

44
00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:15.315
to Romans chapter 12.

45
00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:18.515
Again, we're in this for the, the long haul.

46
00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:20.755
So bookmark Romans chapter 12.

47
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.715
Today we're gonna be in verses three through eight.

48
00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:27.675
It's all about serving as you're turning it.

49
00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:29.115
Remember that this whole chapter,

50
00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.235
and really the rest of the book hinges on the first two

51
00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:36.115
verses, Romans chapter 12, verses one and two.

52
00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:40.155
That's a transitional section from chapters one through 11

53
00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:43.795
where he highlights the theology, uh, of God's nature,

54
00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:46.875
our predicament and our salvation.

55
00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:52.795
Therefore, this is how we live it out.

56
00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.275
And what he does remember in chapters one through 11,

57
00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:59.565
I said this last week, is that he holds up Christ

58
00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:03.925
as the perfect standard, as the plumb Bob

59
00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:07.165
that we have seen in the bumper video.

60
00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.205
But then also every week we're gonna have it up here

61
00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:11.445
that this is the, the perfect vertical.

62
00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:15.405
When we see Jesus, we see him as the standard,

63
00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:18.045
what perfect vertical actually is.

64
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.005
Now we all fall short of that, of course.

65
00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:22.845
So we need the grace of God in that.

66
00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:26.805
But we're also to be realigned back to

67
00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:27.885
that standard every day.

68
00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:29.845
That's what Romans 12 shows us, is this is

69
00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:32.725
what a realigned kind of life looks like.

70
00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:36.475
So we need his grace, we need his mercy,

71
00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:40.515
and we need his transformation in our lives.

72
00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.875
And Romans 12 paints that picture for us.

73
00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:45.315
It reminds us of God's mercies.

74
00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:47.835
It reminds us, uh, to offer ourselves

75
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.755
as a living sacrifice to God.

76
00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:53.515
And then we are to serve as a result of that.

77
00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:55.955
That's the first thing He says,

78
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.075
after offering yourself not being conformed to the world,

79
00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:00.555
the first thing he talks about is

80
00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:01.955
serving one another within the church.

81
00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:06.225
It's that important. Now again,

82
00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:07.625
we've got a perfect standard.

83
00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:10.225
So our model is Jesus,

84
00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:16.235
Who in Mark 10 45, it says, came not to be served,

85
00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:20.595
but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many,

86
00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:25.035
the king of the universe, the one worthy of being served.

87
00:04:25.135 --> 00:04:27.555
He came not to be served but to serve.

88
00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:29.115
So that's our standard.

89
00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:30.395
That's what we're realigning back

90
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.675
to every single day of our lives.

91
00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:35.975
And so look now at Romans chapter 12,

92
00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:37.895
verses three through eight.

93
00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:40.255
This is a transformed life of serving others.

94
00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:45.105
Watch this For, by the grace given

95
00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:47.625
to me, I say to everyone among you not to think

96
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.865
of himself more highly than he ought to think.

97
00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:53.985
But to think with sober judgment, each according

98
00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:57.665
to the measure of faith that God has assigned for,

99
00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:59.345
as in one body, we have many members,

100
00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:02.345
and the members do not all have the same function.

101
00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:06.265
So we though many are one body in Christ

102
00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:10.825
and individually members, one of another, having gifts

103
00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:12.945
that differ according to the grace given to us.

104
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:17.105
Let us use them if prophecy in proportion to our faith,

105
00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:20.185
if service in our serving, the one

106
00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:22.505
who teaches in his teaching, the one

107
00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:25.065
who exhorts in his exhortation, the one

108
00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:29.105
who contributes in generosity, the one who leads with zeal,

109
00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:32.545
the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness.

110
00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:37.875
So God, this is your word and we come to it humbly,

111
00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:43.395
and we want you to speak through it and change us today.

112
00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:44.835
Make us more like Christ

113
00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:47.035
and his service of us,

114
00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.875
that we can serve one another like that.

115
00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:54.365
But we know Holy Spirit, you've gotta change our hearts.

116
00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:57.445
You've gotta make us unselfish kind of people

117
00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.605
where we are prone to be so selfish.

118
00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:06.395
So lead us, teach us today from this, that we be doers

119
00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:08.635
of the word, not merely hearers, only

120
00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.555
for your glory, for our good. In Jesus' name,

121
00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:13.465
Amen.

122
00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.875
So notice what we learned about this transformed life.

123
00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:21.195
This life realigned to the perfect life of Christ.

124
00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:22.835
First we learned that serving

125
00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:25.515
that kinda life serving is founded on humility.

126
00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:29.635
That's the first part of this. It's founded on humility.

127
00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:33.475
This transformed life. We must found it on humility.

128
00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:37.795
That was verse three, very clearly by the grace given to me,

129
00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:40.035
I say to everyone among you, not to think

130
00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:42.235
of himself more highly than he ought to think.

131
00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.875
But to think with sober judgment, according to the measure

132
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.155
of faith, God is assigned.

133
00:06:48.745 --> 00:06:51.075
Okay? So we've got to think differently.

134
00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:52.395
So where does that start?

135
00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:53.995
Well, first of all, we have

136
00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:56.235
to think about seeing God rightly.

137
00:06:57.295 --> 00:06:59.355
If we're gonna be humble and think about ourselves rightly,

138
00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:03.475
we've gotta see God rightly first it all starts with him,

139
00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:07.235
or top down theology, not bottom up theology.

140
00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:09.555
This is what we are starting with is him.

141
00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:11.915
And remember what Romans one through 11 taught.

142
00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:15.915
It's that God is holy. God is a God of justice.

143
00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:17.995
God is a God of wrath towards sin.

144
00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:19.995
God is a God who's sovereign overall.

145
00:07:20.655 --> 00:07:24.595
And in light of that, he is also merciful and gracious.

146
00:07:26.615 --> 00:07:28.225
He's slow to anger. He's abounding

147
00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:29.825
and steadfast love and faithfulness.

148
00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:32.785
This is our God all through Christ.

149
00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:35.425
That's how he shows up here in the world.

150
00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:39.535
It's how we know him. So we see him

151
00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:40.855
rightly, that's who he is.

152
00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:43.495
And as we see God rightly, that leads us

153
00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:46.015
to see ourselves rightly in light of who he is

154
00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:51.545
when we see God rightly, you truly see yourself,

155
00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:57.175
God is God, you're not.

156
00:07:58.675 --> 00:08:02.815
And so you discover then the most important thing you

157
00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.375
and I can live for in our lives is not ourselves.

158
00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:09.505
If he is God and we're not,

159
00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:11.785
we discover we should live for him.

160
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.465
That's the most important thing to live for.

161
00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:18.305
And that's then what leads you to think of yourself, not

162
00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:22.525
as highly as you often do to link.

163
00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:25.405
Think of yourself, not more highly than you ought to think.

164
00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:31.895
Now, some people take that too far. Are you valuable?

165
00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:36.135
Absolutely you are. The point is,

166
00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:37.975
you're just not more valuable than everyone else.

167
00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:43.175
So what Philippians two says a lot,

168
00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:44.415
we'll get to that in a moment.

169
00:08:44.515 --> 00:08:47.095
But, but instead of thinking I'm more important than

170
00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:51.135
everyone else, it says think with sober judgment.

171
00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:55.215
A a phrase that means sensible.

172
00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:58.285
That you're clearheaded, you're seeing things accurately.

173
00:08:59.795 --> 00:09:02.285
There's no delusion, there's no deception.

174
00:09:02.285 --> 00:09:04.365
There's no lying about your character to try

175
00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:05.685
to put some reputation.

176
00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.165
You're not just putting the,

177
00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:09.005
the pure Instagram photos on there.

178
00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:10.685
You're, you're putting everything out there.

179
00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:11.765
It's, it's no delusion.

180
00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:14.645
You are just humbly telling the truth about who you are

181
00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:17.085
and who those people are,

182
00:09:19.015 --> 00:09:21.805
which leads you, again, to what I said about Philippians

183
00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:26.005
says this in Philippians two, verse three,

184
00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:29.525
do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,

185
00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:31.085
but in humility,

186
00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:33.965
count others more significant than yourselves.

187
00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:39.155
The way of the world, the way of our flesh is

188
00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:42.195
that I'm most important, I'm most significant.

189
00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:44.035
This says, in Christ,

190
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.475
you count others more significant than you.

191
00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:48.195
That's humility, right?

192
00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:51.815
If you and I are going

193
00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:55.055
to serve one another in the way God has designed us

194
00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:59.655
to serve one another, we've got to lay aside.

195
00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:03.695
Pretentiousness, got to lay aside selfishness.

196
00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:05.535
We've gotta lay aside this desire

197
00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:06.855
to build our own reputation.

198
00:10:07.075 --> 00:10:09.975
We have to lay all that, count it as nothing, die

199
00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:14.495
to ourselves and humble ourselves like Jesus did when he

200
00:10:14.675 --> 00:10:16.255
washed his disciples feet.

201
00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:19.215
You know why that was such a big deal?

202
00:10:19.965 --> 00:10:23.215
Because that was an act reserved for the lowest

203
00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:25.015
of the servants in the household.

204
00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:28.695
And Jesus, the one they saw,

205
00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.015
this is the Messiah, this is the king.

206
00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:34.105
He did it. And that's the context.

207
00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:37.305
He said, I didn't come to be served. I came to serve.

208
00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:41.105
Do this just like I'm doing it for you.

209
00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:45.585
Do this for one another. Serve one another like this.

210
00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:49.345
And so we've got to be humble.

211
00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:51.705
We have to start with humility.

212
00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:54.145
If we see ourselves too highly,

213
00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:55.385
we're not gonna serve others.

214
00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:59.555
But there's a second point here in Romans 12

215
00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:02.875
that this lifestyle, this realigned lifestyle

216
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:05.475
of serving is supported by unity.

217
00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:10.315
It's founded on humility. We start there, see God, right?

218
00:11:10.415 --> 00:11:14.595
See ourselves, right then it's also supported by unity.

219
00:11:17.805 --> 00:11:19.575
Look again at verses four through six here,

220
00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:24.455
for as in one body, we have many members.

221
00:11:24.755 --> 00:11:26.975
And the members do not all have the same function.

222
00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:29.015
He's looking at our physical bodies there.

223
00:11:30.235 --> 00:11:32.575
So we though many are one body in Christ

224
00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:36.735
and individually members, one of another, having gifts

225
00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:38.615
that differ according to the grace given to us.

226
00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:40.415
Let us use them.

227
00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:44.295
Now, if you read the Bible for any length of time,

228
00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:48.175
you see this is the most common illustration it gives

229
00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:50.015
for the church.

230
00:11:50.885 --> 00:11:55.805
This idea of the body, it helps us understand the nature

231
00:11:56.105 --> 00:11:58.125
of what this thing is we call the church.

232
00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:02.125
And so here's what it teaches us.

233
00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:05.245
It teaches us that the body parts,

234
00:12:05.345 --> 00:12:07.685
we are all different, right?

235
00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:10.445
So as the body parts are all different,

236
00:12:10.445 --> 00:12:12.645
that's the same way it works in your physical body

237
00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.765
and it works that way in the church.

238
00:12:15.105 --> 00:12:17.365
All the body parts are different.

239
00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:20.855
There are many unique members.

240
00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.375
We all have different gifts from God.

241
00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:25.575
And you can see that just by turning around

242
00:12:25.575 --> 00:12:27.295
and looking around this room, right?

243
00:12:27.295 --> 00:12:30.895
We are all very, very different with our backgrounds,

244
00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:33.895
with diverse sin, struggles that we all may have.

245
00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:36.535
The varying shapes and sizes, we won't get into that at all.

246
00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:39.455
Like diff different financial situations of life.

247
00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:40.655
There's all kinds of things

248
00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:43.495
that we have uniquely talented abilities, passions,

249
00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:45.775
we're all over the place where you were born,

250
00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:50.095
where you were coming from, all of that very different.

251
00:12:50.115 --> 00:12:52.935
And life would be really boring if we were all

252
00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:54.015
the same, wouldn't it?

253
00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:59.435
This is God's design for us to be

254
00:12:59.655 --> 00:13:01.275
so different from one another.

255
00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:06.295
It's intentional because it uniquely reveals his glory.

256
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:10.535
That if God can create such diverse people

257
00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:15.215
and then bring them together in unity, that is only by God.

258
00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:21.965
And it's the same way with our physical bodies.

259
00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:25.765
Kids just, just look at your hand, kids, right?

260
00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:28.685
Hold your hand up. Look at that. It's different than your

261
00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:29.845
nose, isn't it?

262
00:13:30.095 --> 00:13:31.885
Right? Like it's, it's very different.

263
00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:35.805
Each body part has a different purpose and function.

264
00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:38.965
They're not the same. But I have two hands.

265
00:13:38.995 --> 00:13:41.205
Yeah, but you have two different hands. I have two. Okay.

266
00:13:41.205 --> 00:13:43.045
No, but just you, you can think through it.

267
00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:44.605
They are still different.

268
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:50.495
The church has many members. We are all different.

269
00:13:51.115 --> 00:13:52.415
Not all have the same function.

270
00:13:53.555 --> 00:13:54.695
So the principle, he,

271
00:13:54.695 --> 00:13:57.095
the Bible teaches us about the nature of the church.

272
00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:02.125
Yet remember what Romans 12 said.

273
00:14:02.145 --> 00:14:04.085
If you notice that while we are different,

274
00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:07.405
we are all still one.

275
00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:12.955
We are different yet still

276
00:14:13.735 --> 00:14:16.585
one a couple times.

277
00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:21.045
Verse four says, there is one body, verse five,

278
00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:24.885
though many, we are one body in Christ.

279
00:14:26.055 --> 00:14:29.725
Verse Corinthians 1227, we are the body of Christ.

280
00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:32.045
Now, all that language, it smells like unity, doesn't it?

281
00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:34.965
I guess just one. There's one, there's one. Think about it.

282
00:14:34.985 --> 00:14:38.525
The parts of your physical body are not to compete

283
00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:39.645
with one another.

284
00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:41.525
We're not to think that this part

285
00:14:41.525 --> 00:14:44.285
of the body is more valuable than that part of the body.

286
00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:47.885
Each part of the body is to work towards the same goal

287
00:14:48.035 --> 00:14:52.205
that the head dreams up the brain functions thinking,

288
00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:53.365
this is what I want to do.

289
00:14:53.545 --> 00:14:55.205
And so the rest of the body says, all right,

290
00:14:55.205 --> 00:14:56.805
we're gonna do everything we can to get us there.

291
00:14:59.145 --> 00:15:01.725
If one part of the body is working in one direction,

292
00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:04.045
another part of the body is working a totally different

293
00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:05.365
direction, or if one part

294
00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:08.525
of the body is being neglected than the body will not

295
00:15:08.885 --> 00:15:10.725
function as it was intended to function.

296
00:15:11.905 --> 00:15:13.365
And we completely get this.

297
00:15:13.385 --> 00:15:16.125
We understand this just inherently, physically, we get it.

298
00:15:18.215 --> 00:15:20.995
We all have to work towards one purpose.

299
00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:28.375
Not only are we one, this passage also taught that we are

300
00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:30.855
dependent on one another.

301
00:15:32.245 --> 00:15:34.015
It's not just that we're one together,

302
00:15:34.145 --> 00:15:36.055
we're unified and we're one body.

303
00:15:36.285 --> 00:15:39.015
It's that we are actually dependent on one another.

304
00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:43.575
That's what verse five says.

305
00:15:44.315 --> 00:15:47.895
We are individually members, one of another.

306
00:15:48.225 --> 00:15:50.015
We're not just members of the body.

307
00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:53.895
We're members one of another. We're interconnected.

308
00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:57.975
We're not just like a, a random collection pile

309
00:15:58.115 --> 00:16:01.175
of body parts all thrown together, that we just happen

310
00:16:01.175 --> 00:16:02.295
to be in the same vicinity.

311
00:16:03.165 --> 00:16:05.985
We are actually interconnected, interdependent

312
00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:09.345
body of members.

313
00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:16.795
I love how one Corinthians puts this chapter 12,

314
00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:20.635
verses 21 through 26 says, the eye cannot say to the hand,

315
00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:24.035
I have no need of you, nor again, the head to the feet.

316
00:16:24.115 --> 00:16:27.475
I have no need of you. On the contrary, the parts

317
00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:30.835
of the body that seem to be weaker, are indispensable.

318
00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:34.995
And on those parts of the body, we think less honorable.

319
00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:36.355
We bestow the greater honor.

320
00:16:36.575 --> 00:16:38.115
And our unpresentable parts are treated

321
00:16:38.115 --> 00:16:39.395
with greater modesty,

322
00:16:39.395 --> 00:16:41.395
which are more presentable parts do not require.

323
00:16:41.775 --> 00:16:44.515
But listen, God has so composed the body,

324
00:16:44.615 --> 00:16:49.255
he designed the body such

325
00:16:49.335 --> 00:16:51.975
that giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,

326
00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:54.335
that there may be no division in the body,

327
00:16:54.635 --> 00:16:57.935
but that the members may have the same care for one another.

328
00:16:58.315 --> 00:17:00.495
If one member suffers, all suffer together.

329
00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:03.775
If one member is honored, all rejoice together.

330
00:17:06.885 --> 00:17:09.385
So again, let me summarize what this is teaching us.

331
00:17:09.645 --> 00:17:14.145
For us to be all that God created us to be,

332
00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:20.805
for the body of Christ to function as God intended it

333
00:17:21.065 --> 00:17:24.285
to function, then I need you.

334
00:17:24.785 --> 00:17:28.365
You need me. You need each other. We need all of us.

335
00:17:31.265 --> 00:17:32.645
No one can sit on the sidelines.

336
00:17:34.485 --> 00:17:36.985
No one can be neglected or excluded.

337
00:17:40.055 --> 00:17:43.315
If that happens, then we will not fulfill the glorious

338
00:17:43.315 --> 00:17:46.235
purpose for which God created the church, the body.

339
00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:53.285
But just think, then imagine, as we do all, participate,

340
00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:56.125
as we do all engage and serve

341
00:17:56.345 --> 00:17:59.445
and realign our lives with the perfect vertical of Christ

342
00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:00.885
and the way he served us.

343
00:18:01.065 --> 00:18:02.365
And we can serve each other like that.

344
00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:04.565
As we do that, watch out.

345
00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:07.845
Be amazed at what God will do with that.

346
00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:13.095
Maybe not convinced yet.

347
00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:17.215
So lemme give you a further illustration to help even more.

348
00:18:17.255 --> 00:18:19.255
I wanna invite Mark and Randy to come on up

349
00:18:19.255 --> 00:18:20.935
and help me with this one.

350
00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:22.695
These are two faithful servants of the Lord.

351
00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:24.455
They play the piano all the time. They're incredible.

352
00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:28.455
What we wanna do is give you a musical example of

353
00:18:28.455 --> 00:18:31.975
what I have just talked about for a while already.

354
00:18:36.195 --> 00:18:38.935
And so here's what we're gonna do, mark, uh,

355
00:18:38.955 --> 00:18:41.615
why don't you just start by playing a, a simple melody,

356
00:18:41.765 --> 00:18:44.735
just one hand, one part being played with this,

357
00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:50.975
okay?

358
00:18:51.925 --> 00:18:53.775
It's nice. Like we can enjoy that. We understand.

359
00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:56.175
We, we know that song. We we've heard that before, right?

360
00:18:56.585 --> 00:18:59.095
We'll just add another part to that, one more part added

361
00:18:59.115 --> 00:19:01.735
to it that's complimentary to the first part.

362
00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:09.655
Okay? It's beautiful, beautiful.

363
00:19:10.715 --> 00:19:12.335
Notice how the two parts are different.

364
00:19:13.475 --> 00:19:18.255
But as his two parts fulfill their roles in the same song,

365
00:19:18.285 --> 00:19:21.375
what you see is a beautiful more full picture.

366
00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:26.375
Well, Randy, why don't you add two more parts to this

367
00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:30.175
and just see what this wonderful song can sound like,

368
00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:47.935
Like Four different parts working together,

369
00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:51.615
dependent on each other for it all to work

370
00:19:52.075 --> 00:19:53.215
and to be beautiful.

371
00:19:55.765 --> 00:19:56.975
Okay, so now let's think though

372
00:19:58.315 --> 00:19:59.975
how it could go a different way.

373
00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:04.295
So Randy, why don't you start, let,

374
00:20:04.295 --> 00:20:05.935
let's flip the, the roll here a little bit.

375
00:20:05.935 --> 00:20:07.895
Randy, why don't you start with just that one hand,

376
00:20:08.035 --> 00:20:09.335
one line, one part.

377
00:20:09.335 --> 00:20:11.495
Just start with that melody again.

378
00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:16.975
Okay? Now add your, your second part.

379
00:20:23.485 --> 00:20:25.455
Okay, now, mark, why don't you add two more parts

380
00:20:25.485 --> 00:20:26.655
like Randy did before.

381
00:20:32.285 --> 00:20:34.655
Beautiful. But what if Mark

382
00:20:35.975 --> 00:20:39.295
insisted on his own way and said, you know what?

383
00:20:39.695 --> 00:20:41.495
I wanna play it at a faster tempo

384
00:20:41.645 --> 00:20:42.895
than what Randy's playing it.

385
00:20:42.965 --> 00:20:44.335
Same song, but faster tempo.

386
00:20:49.035 --> 00:20:51.365
Okay, that, that, that doesn't work, right?

387
00:20:51.945 --> 00:20:54.605
That's just a nutty mess. It sounds terrible.

388
00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:57.005
Okay, so let's get back to, uh, the unity again.

389
00:20:57.025 --> 00:20:58.165
All right, start, start again.

390
00:20:58.175 --> 00:20:59.445
Let's see how we're doing that.

391
00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:06.365
Okay, well, what if this time Randy decided on his own way

392
00:21:06.385 --> 00:21:09.925
and he wanted to play this song at, at, at a different key.

393
00:21:18.595 --> 00:21:20.005
Okay. Uh,

394
00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:23.725
same song, same tempo.

395
00:21:27.315 --> 00:21:31.365
Okay, alright, that's enough. Okay. Alright.

396
00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:33.485
Uh, ouch. Right?

397
00:21:35.505 --> 00:21:38.445
But church, listen, isn't that what happens in churches

398
00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:42.475
so often is that people choose

399
00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:46.195
to play different songs, different tempos, different keys,

400
00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:49.515
and it just sounds like that.

401
00:21:49.855 --> 00:21:52.475
Or they, they, they insist on their own way

402
00:21:53.735 --> 00:21:57.035
or they, they want to use their gifts for themselves, not

403
00:21:57.035 --> 00:22:01.635
for others, but like,

404
00:22:01.635 --> 00:22:04.115
just think, wouldn't we much rather

405
00:22:05.765 --> 00:22:09.535
have every part playing the same song in the the same tempo

406
00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:10.815
on the same key?

407
00:22:10.945 --> 00:22:13.055
Can't, can't we long for that?

408
00:22:13.075 --> 00:22:16.535
And just again, what it sounds like, I,

409
00:22:53.195 --> 00:22:54.135
Oh man, okay.

410
00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:56.855
Can we say thank you to Mark and Randy for that?

411
00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:01.935
Oh, oh man.

412
00:23:02.595 --> 00:23:04.335
And did you see how much fun they were having too

413
00:23:04.595 --> 00:23:05.775
as they were playing their parts

414
00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:09.015
and just how hard it was, first of all, for them

415
00:23:09.015 --> 00:23:10.975
to play it wrong first that was amazing.

416
00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:14.895
But then how much fun it is to play it correctly

417
00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:17.655
and to see, to see

418
00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:20.575
the parts fit together like it does.

419
00:23:21.325 --> 00:23:23.095
It's an amazing picture.

420
00:23:23.275 --> 00:23:25.375
See, church, we all have different parts to play,

421
00:23:27.385 --> 00:23:30.765
but we have one body with one song,

422
00:23:32.185 --> 00:23:35.605
the Song of Christ, and we are all

423
00:23:35.925 --> 00:23:37.205
dependent on one another.

424
00:23:39.265 --> 00:23:42.645
See, a musician cannot insist on his own way

425
00:23:42.745 --> 00:23:44.205
or it's gonna go really badly,

426
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:48.185
but it goes really well.

427
00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:52.585
And it's so much fun when every part is playing their

428
00:23:52.585 --> 00:23:54.185
part for the same song.

429
00:23:54.185 --> 00:23:55.265
Same tempo, same key.

430
00:23:55.265 --> 00:23:56.825
We're heading in the right direction together.

431
00:23:58.655 --> 00:24:00.115
That's why the final aspect of

432
00:24:00.115 --> 00:24:01.595
what we learn here about serving is

433
00:24:01.595 --> 00:24:03.475
that it is oriented toward others.

434
00:24:05.185 --> 00:24:07.715
It's not about me, it's not about you. It's not selfish.

435
00:24:07.975 --> 00:24:09.955
It is oriented toward others.

436
00:24:13.255 --> 00:24:15.635
That's why he lists out in verses six through eight,

437
00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:18.315
these gifts, watch this, he said, having gifts

438
00:24:18.315 --> 00:24:20.515
that differ according to the grace given to us.

439
00:24:20.775 --> 00:24:23.955
Let us use them if prophecy

440
00:24:23.955 --> 00:24:26.235
and proportion to our faith if service in our serving,

441
00:24:26.495 --> 00:24:28.515
the one who teaches in his teaching, the one

442
00:24:28.515 --> 00:24:30.635
who exhorts in his exhortation, the one

443
00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:33.275
who contributes in generosity, the one who leads with zeal,

444
00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:36.515
the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness.

445
00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:39.155
So he's talking about gifts.

446
00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:40.635
Now, you might not be aware of what these are.

447
00:24:40.835 --> 00:24:42.435
These are called spiritual gifts.

448
00:24:42.845 --> 00:24:47.395
These are supernatural abilities from God, empowered by God

449
00:24:47.535 --> 00:24:50.915
and his spirit in you to use for the church.

450
00:24:53.005 --> 00:24:55.905
And this list here that he lists is not exhaustive

451
00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:57.585
because there's other lists at other times,

452
00:24:57.605 --> 00:25:00.105
the New Testament that are mentioned elsewhere.

453
00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:04.065
Things like evangelism or discernment or languages.

454
00:25:04.065 --> 00:25:05.345
There's all kinds of other things

455
00:25:05.345 --> 00:25:06.945
that we could list out in that.

456
00:25:08.005 --> 00:25:10.265
And so he does these lists and we can collate those

457
00:25:10.285 --> 00:25:11.985
and put 'em all together as one large list.

458
00:25:12.165 --> 00:25:14.905
But here's the thing about those gifts, just

459
00:25:14.905 --> 00:25:16.545
because you may only have one

460
00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:18.585
or two of those gifts,

461
00:25:19.365 --> 00:25:22.905
it does not exclude you from practicing those gifts when

462
00:25:22.905 --> 00:25:25.025
they're commanded of you in other ways.

463
00:25:26.055 --> 00:25:27.665
Like evangelism is not my gift.

464
00:25:28.345 --> 00:25:30.425
I can't walk up to somebody and just have a conversation.

465
00:25:30.425 --> 00:25:33.305
It's hard for me. It's not supernaturally empowered by me,

466
00:25:33.445 --> 00:25:36.145
but I'm still called to share the gospel, right?

467
00:25:36.145 --> 00:25:38.465
So it's not gift, but it's a command.

468
00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:40.985
Mercy, same thing that's not natural to you.

469
00:25:40.985 --> 00:25:45.735
You still called to show mercy, it just might not come

470
00:25:45.735 --> 00:25:47.575
as easily if you don't have the gift, that's okay.

471
00:25:47.965 --> 00:25:49.055
It's commanded.

472
00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:51.455
But if you have that gift, it is

473
00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:54.695
flourishing in you and through you.

474
00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:57.175
That's what spiritual gifts are.

475
00:25:57.175 --> 00:25:58.175
That's what he's talking about here.

476
00:25:58.195 --> 00:26:00.175
So here's the question, then it arises from this.

477
00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:04.175
How do you know what your gift or gifts is?

478
00:26:05.155 --> 00:26:08.835
How do you know? Like how, how, how would you find this out?

479
00:26:08.855 --> 00:26:09.915
Do you know? Like,

480
00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:14.235
do you know what God has given you?

481
00:26:14.335 --> 00:26:17.155
Do you know how you are gifted by the Lord

482
00:26:17.255 --> 00:26:19.395
to serve his body as a member?

483
00:26:21.855 --> 00:26:24.715
The reality is sadly, many Christians don't know

484
00:26:25.815 --> 00:26:28.235
and we kind of assume or we kind of have some sense, but,

485
00:26:28.235 --> 00:26:29.515
but we don't know.

486
00:26:30.535 --> 00:26:35.355
But just think again, how much more effective you would be

487
00:26:35.615 --> 00:26:38.795
if you did know, like, this is my lane,

488
00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:39.915
this is what I'm supposed to do.

489
00:26:39.915 --> 00:26:43.405
Like how much of a joy would it be for you to know

490
00:26:43.425 --> 00:26:45.925
and find it and then run in your lane?

491
00:26:48.465 --> 00:26:51.595
Mine teaching leading administration,

492
00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:52.795
those are my top three gifts.

493
00:26:54.545 --> 00:26:57.445
And so when I'm doing this, when I'm leading,

494
00:26:57.445 --> 00:27:01.165
when I'm adminis like kind of detail focused, like I see

495
00:27:01.305 --> 00:27:04.045
and sense God's blessing and God's pleasure on it,

496
00:27:05.395 --> 00:27:08.405
because that's my lane over here.

497
00:27:08.405 --> 00:27:09.405
These other things, those aren't my

498
00:27:09.405 --> 00:27:10.365
lane, but that's one of yours.

499
00:27:10.365 --> 00:27:12.165
That's yours. That's yours. That, that's, that's

500
00:27:12.165 --> 00:27:14.565
where you're supposed to be your part of the body.

501
00:27:14.565 --> 00:27:19.415
This is my part of the body and God is blessing it.

502
00:27:21.165 --> 00:27:24.715
Okay? So if you don't know, how do you find out?

503
00:27:26.025 --> 00:27:27.235
Well, here's one of the best ways.

504
00:27:27.975 --> 00:27:29.395
Ask the people who know you the best.

505
00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:33.085
Just ask the people that are in your life

506
00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:34.685
that are watching you and knowing you and,

507
00:27:34.705 --> 00:27:35.965
and discovering things with you.

508
00:27:35.965 --> 00:27:37.965
Like ask them, what is my spiritual gift?

509
00:27:37.965 --> 00:27:41.035
What do you think it is? And if you ask enough people,

510
00:27:41.335 --> 00:27:43.355
it might start to align around a few things.

511
00:27:43.355 --> 00:27:45.435
You're like, oh, okay, that, that may be it.

512
00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:49.835
But here's another tool. We've got a quick online

513
00:27:50.165 --> 00:27:51.715
assessment that helps.

514
00:27:52.625 --> 00:27:55.675
It's not perfect, but at least might help you.

515
00:27:55.695 --> 00:27:57.995
And so I sent a link in my email last week.

516
00:27:58.265 --> 00:28:00.355
I'll send it again this upcoming week.

517
00:28:00.625 --> 00:28:02.275
There's also, if you're using the notes,

518
00:28:02.455 --> 00:28:04.035
the sermon notes on the app,

519
00:28:04.105 --> 00:28:07.275
there's a a link button embedded into the app.

520
00:28:07.295 --> 00:28:08.555
You could take it from there.

521
00:28:08.665 --> 00:28:11.275
There's also a QR code on your physical notes.

522
00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:12.435
If you have the paper copy,

523
00:28:12.695 --> 00:28:14.035
you can go home and do that today.

524
00:28:14.035 --> 00:28:15.355
And so let me just encourage you

525
00:28:15.535 --> 00:28:17.755
to take a few minutes this afternoon.

526
00:28:17.975 --> 00:28:20.075
You get home, say, God, I'm gonna lay in my life.

527
00:28:20.175 --> 00:28:21.955
I'm gonna turn the TV off, turn my phone off.

528
00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:26.315
I'm gonna lay my life before you as a living sacrifice

529
00:28:26.375 --> 00:28:29.715
and say, okay, God, show me how you've gifted me.

530
00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:33.235
I want to know and just be honest and

531
00:28:33.335 --> 00:28:35.915
and work through something like this assessment

532
00:28:35.935 --> 00:28:37.755
and just say, God, I want to know.

533
00:28:39.225 --> 00:28:43.155
Because here's the thing, God would not include these lists

534
00:28:43.215 --> 00:28:45.475
of gifts in His word

535
00:28:47.095 --> 00:28:49.555
if he didn't intend for us to know them

536
00:28:49.815 --> 00:28:51.475
and use them what he's given us.

537
00:28:52.655 --> 00:28:56.565
He wouldn't name them if he didn't say to

538
00:28:57.085 --> 00:28:58.445
somebody, you've got that gift.

539
00:28:58.825 --> 00:29:02.125
Use it. We need

540
00:29:02.125 --> 00:29:04.165
to find our gifts and use them.

541
00:29:04.165 --> 00:29:05.685
Which leads to the second question then

542
00:29:05.685 --> 00:29:06.685
that comes from this passage.

543
00:29:07.675 --> 00:29:10.965
Once you discover your gift, how then can you use

544
00:29:11.035 --> 00:29:12.325
that gift for others?

545
00:29:13.745 --> 00:29:16.445
How can you use the gift

546
00:29:16.835 --> 00:29:19.245
that God gave you for others?

547
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:26.275
Every spiritual gift is for the benefit of others.

548
00:29:28.345 --> 00:29:29.355
It's not for you.

549
00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:33.515
Like a tree does not produce fruit for itself.

550
00:29:34.775 --> 00:29:38.555
It doesn't produce apples and then cannibalize those apples

551
00:29:38.575 --> 00:29:40.475
and gorge itself on its own fruit.

552
00:29:40.535 --> 00:29:41.605
That's not the point.

553
00:29:41.785 --> 00:29:45.005
The point of a fruit tree is so that it would produce fruit

554
00:29:45.185 --> 00:29:48.405
for others good, that it would produce other trees

555
00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:49.845
to nourish and support

556
00:29:49.945 --> 00:29:52.085
and care for others within the body of Christ.

557
00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:54.125
That's why he gave us gifts.

558
00:29:56.555 --> 00:29:59.495
See, he didn't give me the gift of teaching for me

559
00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:01.895
to build some platform for myself.

560
00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:06.375
He gave me the gift of teaching so that I can benefit you.

561
00:30:06.595 --> 00:30:09.695
The body of Christ serve the body in that unique small way

562
00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:12.415
to serve the church and say, here's what I want to do.

563
00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:15.255
God said through you for the benefit of the church.

564
00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:21.835
Your gift of giving is to benefit others.

565
00:30:22.065 --> 00:30:23.475
It's not to promote yourself

566
00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.275
or to make a name for yourself of how much you gave.

567
00:30:26.275 --> 00:30:28.395
Your gift of giving is to serve others

568
00:30:28.705 --> 00:30:30.675
with the resources God gave you

569
00:30:35.205 --> 00:30:36.265
And so on and so forth.

570
00:30:36.265 --> 00:30:38.745
You can see all these gifts could be used for ourselves,

571
00:30:39.165 --> 00:30:41.745
but instead they're to be used for others.

572
00:30:44.005 --> 00:30:45.825
One Peter four 10 reminds us that

573
00:30:45.825 --> 00:30:49.065
as each has received a gift, use it

574
00:30:49.085 --> 00:30:52.585
to serve one another as good stewards

575
00:30:52.585 --> 00:30:54.105
of God's varied grace.

576
00:30:56.205 --> 00:30:57.265
So unique, different.

577
00:30:57.265 --> 00:30:58.745
Each one of you has a different gift

578
00:30:58.805 --> 00:31:00.425
and passion of how to use that.

579
00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:02.825
It's beautiful, it's varied,

580
00:31:02.965 --> 00:31:05.345
but we ought to be good stewards of it.

581
00:31:06.085 --> 00:31:07.105
And again, I said it

582
00:31:07.105 --> 00:31:10.105
before, it's essential that every part

583
00:31:10.645 --> 00:31:14.825
is utilizing their unique gift following our head.

584
00:31:15.005 --> 00:31:16.705
I'm not the head, the elders aren't the head.

585
00:31:16.795 --> 00:31:18.025
Jesus is the head of the church.

586
00:31:18.525 --> 00:31:19.705
So we're following our head.

587
00:31:19.955 --> 00:31:22.545
Jesus Christ, he's leading us in direction.

588
00:31:22.695 --> 00:31:26.025
He's coming up with the ideas and we are to follow him.

589
00:31:26.645 --> 00:31:30.665
If we don't each use our gift, then our growth

590
00:31:31.005 --> 00:31:33.385
as a church will be stunted.

591
00:31:36.265 --> 00:31:39.755
Listen to this. Ephesians four

592
00:31:41.585 --> 00:31:42.595
says it so well.

593
00:31:44.255 --> 00:31:47.155
And God gave the apostles, prophets, evangelist shepherds

594
00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:51.715
and teachers to equip the saints, the church for the work

595
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:55.595
of ministry, for building up the body of Christ

596
00:31:57.385 --> 00:32:00.535
Until we all attain to the unity of the faith

597
00:32:00.755 --> 00:32:04.855
and the knowledge of the Son of God to mature manhood

598
00:32:05.075 --> 00:32:09.375
to the measure, the stature of the fullness of Christ, so

599
00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:12.215
that we may no longer be children tossed to

600
00:32:12.215 --> 00:32:14.455
and fro by the waves carried about by every wind

601
00:32:14.455 --> 00:32:17.095
of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness

602
00:32:17.095 --> 00:32:18.895
and deceitful schemes by the way of the world.

603
00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:22.975
Basically rather speaking the truth in love, we are

604
00:32:23.035 --> 00:32:25.975
to grow up in every way into him.

605
00:32:26.115 --> 00:32:28.095
Who is the head into Christ?

606
00:32:28.365 --> 00:32:30.015
From whom the whole body joined

607
00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:31.455
and held together by every joint

608
00:32:31.455 --> 00:32:34.055
with which is equipped When each part check this out,

609
00:32:34.205 --> 00:32:36.775
when each part is working properly,

610
00:32:38.175 --> 00:32:41.685
makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.

611
00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:47.625
When each part is working properly, the body grows.

612
00:32:52.065 --> 00:32:54.395
When each part is working properly,

613
00:32:54.625 --> 00:32:57.875
when each part is using the gift God gave it.

614
00:32:58.295 --> 00:33:03.155
We are all built up in love. We all grow in maturity.

615
00:33:03.455 --> 00:33:06.435
We are all strengthened against the attacks of the enemy.

616
00:33:09.685 --> 00:33:13.635
Again, interdependent members of the body.

617
00:33:14.015 --> 00:33:15.555
The church then suffers.

618
00:33:15.775 --> 00:33:18.995
If anyone does not fulfill his or her God-given role.

619
00:33:21.565 --> 00:33:26.135
Each member is vital to the body of Christ functioning as he

620
00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:28.255
designed it to function.

621
00:33:31.875 --> 00:33:36.835
So what's your gift? How has he blessed you?

622
00:33:38.325 --> 00:33:40.585
Ask people who know you best, like just ask.

623
00:33:40.645 --> 00:33:43.465
Try to get some input on that. Take the assessment later.

624
00:33:43.695 --> 00:33:45.225
Just just how has he gifted you?

625
00:33:45.405 --> 00:33:48.265
How has he gifted you for the body?

626
00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:50.185
But then again, don't stop there.

627
00:33:50.805 --> 00:33:53.665
Ask God, how do you want me to use this for the benefit

628
00:33:53.725 --> 00:33:55.105
of others to serve the church?

629
00:33:55.165 --> 00:33:57.025
How do you want me to be doing that?

630
00:33:57.025 --> 00:33:59.225
Again, we wanna help you. Our call in Ephesians four is

631
00:33:59.225 --> 00:34:01.465
to equip the saints for the work of the ministry.

632
00:34:01.605 --> 00:34:03.345
So we wanna help you get there.

633
00:34:03.525 --> 00:34:07.185
And so on the notes on the app, in the email,

634
00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:10.385
there's another button, there's a second QR code,

635
00:34:10.385 --> 00:34:15.065
there's a second link that can help you fill out all of

636
00:34:15.065 --> 00:34:16.905
that information so

637
00:34:16.905 --> 00:34:19.305
that you can better apply the gift

638
00:34:19.435 --> 00:34:20.705
God's given you in this church.

639
00:34:21.405 --> 00:34:23.345
You're like, okay, now I know what my gift is.

640
00:34:23.705 --> 00:34:24.625
I don't know what to do with that.

641
00:34:24.705 --> 00:34:25.505
I don't know how to serve.

642
00:34:25.845 --> 00:34:29.745
We wanna help you there. So you've got two QR codes,

643
00:34:29.745 --> 00:34:34.505
two links, all of that to specifically help you how to serve

644
00:34:35.045 --> 00:34:37.825
and fulfill this realignment back

645
00:34:37.825 --> 00:34:39.185
to the service Christ gave.

646
00:34:41.515 --> 00:34:44.135
But again, don't forget this, above all else,

647
00:34:45.805 --> 00:34:49.695
this all starts by seeing God rightly first,

648
00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:53.785
by then seeing ourselves rightly in light of that,

649
00:34:56.485 --> 00:34:59.025
by understanding the nature of the body of Christ,

650
00:34:59.085 --> 00:35:03.465
the church, and giving ourselves wholeheartedly to him,

651
00:35:04.325 --> 00:35:05.385
you serve the Lord Christ.

652
00:35:05.385 --> 00:35:07.305
You're not serving me, you're not serving the church,

653
00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.305
you're serving Jesus.

654
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:11.745
And so we do that with all our hearts.

655
00:35:11.745 --> 00:35:12.785
We do that with all our effort.

656
00:35:12.855 --> 00:35:15.385
This is walking in the newness of life

657
00:35:15.385 --> 00:35:18.625
that Romans six described, that we are dead to sin,

658
00:35:18.755 --> 00:35:19.865
we're alive to God,

659
00:35:20.045 --> 00:35:21.745
and we are called to live

660
00:35:22.015 --> 00:35:25.665
that truth out even today, not just someday.

661
00:35:28.725 --> 00:35:31.145
And so again, as you think about this, serving

662
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:33.505
may be scary at first.
