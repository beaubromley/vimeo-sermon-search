00:00:01.155 --> 00:00:02.745
Jamie Authorities say this is now

2
00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:03.985
a criminal investigation.

3
00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:06.065
Several fires raging.

4
00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:09.905
Now down this street, smashing grab flash mob at a Nordstrom

5
00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:15.095
police, the number

6
00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:16.695
of homeless people on the streets and in shelter.

7
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.015
Medical treatment

8
00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:21.895
for minors has surprise attack within Israel's borders.

9
00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:22.855
People are for

10
00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:26.975
holding fireworks.

11
00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:48.985
And an angel of the Lord appeared to them

12
00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.305
and the glory of the Lord shown around them

13
00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:52.945
and they were filled with fear.

14
00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.225
And the angel said to them, fear not for behold.

15
00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:59.105
I bring you good news of great joy.

16
00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:05.945
Well, good morning church.

17
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.305
If you are new to our church, my name is John.

18
00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:09.465
I'm one of the pastors here.

19
00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:13.185
Uh, it's an honor that you would come worship with us today.

20
00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:14.865
Uh, we'd love to get to know you somehow

21
00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:16.225
if you would let us do that.

22
00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:18.545
There's an info desk out there in the lobby.

23
00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.105
You can just go say hi to their, uh, to someone there.

24
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:22.945
And we'd love to interact with you

25
00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.985
and help shepherd you and point you to Jesus.

26
00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.225
Maybe you're not ready not to talk to anybody yet.

27
00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:29.585
It's okay. There's a QR code in the seat in front of you.

28
00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:30.945
You can fill that out virtually.

29
00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:32.905
Uh, we'll contact you won't spam,

30
00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:34.425
you won't sell your information.

31
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:36.505
Don't worry about that. But we would love

32
00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:37.585
to just encourage you

33
00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:38.625
and point you towards Jesus,

34
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.745
how you can grow in the Lord in that.

35
00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.585
Uh, but again, it is an encouragement to gather.

36
00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:46.305
Always great to gather as we inch closer to Christmas.

37
00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:49.985
Last week, we looked at Mary's song

38
00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:53.145
and talked a lot about what waiting for the Lord looks like

39
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.825
and especially for Israel, 2000 plus years ago.

40
00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.865
What did that mean for them as they waited on the Lord?

41
00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.065
Well, we also then saw how God came through,

42
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.305
how he brought redemption by taking on flesh

43
00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:09.465
to become our savior, to live a perfect life

44
00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:13.465
and then die, the death that we deserve for our sin.

45
00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:17.875
Well, today we're gonna see another angle on that

46
00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:22.115
as we study Zacharia's prophecy, uh, which would've happened

47
00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.275
around the same time as Mary's song would've happened.

48
00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:27.915
Uh, so turn with me back to Luke chapter one,

49
00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:31.275
and we're gonna be in verse 67, uh,

50
00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:33.195
through 79.

51
00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:34.795
Bounce around a little bit.

52
00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:39.355
Before that though, a little bit of the backstory here.

53
00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.195
Zacharia was a priest at the temple

54
00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:44.675
he had served for many years.

55
00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:46.875
His wife Elizabeth, though,

56
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.275
had never been able to have a child.

57
00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:52.675
And back then that was a big deal.

58
00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:56.595
That was something that would've caused people in that day

59
00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:59.765
to question God's blessings on them,

60
00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:02.405
that maybe they weren't really faithful

61
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:04.965
and they were not having a child.

62
00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:08.085
And so that was something that they looked at as,

63
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.405
as a negative for sure, even to the, even more than,

64
00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:13.765
than we might see it as a, a hardship today.

65
00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:18.285
But by this point in their lives, there was very little hope

66
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:20.085
because the way the scripture says it is

67
00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:22.005
that they were both advanced in years.

68
00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:25.245
That's just a really kind way to say old. Okay?

69
00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:27.285
So you can use that when you go to Christmas

70
00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:29.485
with your family, that you're, I'm just advanced in years.

71
00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:34.165
Okay? Um, so there was little hope, uh, very, very little.

72
00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:36.805
It says zero hope that there was gonna be any resolution

73
00:03:36.865 --> 00:03:38.325
to their problem here.

74
00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:43.365
Yet, in all of that, they were both

75
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:45.405
faithful in following the Lord.

76
00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:50.095
They were following him in every way that they could.

77
00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:55.595
And on one particular day, Zechariah was chosen at random

78
00:03:56.255 --> 00:03:58.875
to enter the temple and burn incense.

79
00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:01.755
Now this was a big deal, uh,

80
00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:05.075
because at at that time some priests never got to do that.

81
00:04:06.415 --> 00:04:08.355
So they put the names in a hat you might think

82
00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:09.675
and pull out one at a time.

83
00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.155
And, and the most you could do it was once in your life

84
00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.475
because then they would take your name outta the hat

85
00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:15.635
and that was your chance.

86
00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:18.435
And so this was already a, a sense of anticipation

87
00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:21.315
for Zechariah as he was chosen to go into the temple

88
00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:24.315
to burn incense that particular day.

89
00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:27.395
But something even more spectacular happened

90
00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:29.755
while he was in the temple.

91
00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:33.515
This is back up in verse 11.

92
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.515
There appeared to Zechariah, an angel

93
00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.555
of the Lord standing on the right side

94
00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:41.115
of the altar of incense.

95
00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:44.825
And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him

96
00:04:44.845 --> 00:04:46.185
and fear fell upon him.

97
00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:49.345
But the angel said to him, do not be afraid.

98
00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:52.945
Zechariah sounds like what he said to Mary.

99
00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:55.545
We saw last week, do not be afraid.

100
00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:57.625
Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard.

101
00:04:57.805 --> 00:04:59.905
And your wife, Elizabeth will bear you a son

102
00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:03.545
and you shall call his name John and you will have joy

103
00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:05.825
and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth

104
00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:07.665
for he will be great before the Lord.

105
00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:10.185
And he must not drink wine or strong drink.

106
00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:12.225
And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit,

107
00:05:12.335 --> 00:05:13.665
even from his mother's womb.

108
00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:16.465
And he will turn many of the children of Israel

109
00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:17.505
to the Lord their God.

110
00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:19.425
And he will go before him.

111
00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:22.625
We don't know who him is yet, but before him in the spirit

112
00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:26.865
and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers

113
00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:29.225
to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom

114
00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:33.785
of the just to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.

115
00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:41.765
Now, this is the same angel that God sent to Mary

116
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:44.365
to tell her about a miraculous birth.

117
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:48.085
He sends that same angel to Zechariah to tell him

118
00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:50.765
that baron Elizabeth was also going

119
00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:52.285
to have a miraculous baby.

120
00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:57.095
Mary heard from that angel about Jesus.

121
00:05:57.475 --> 00:05:59.485
Well, Zechariah hears from that same angel

122
00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:02.725
that this one is going to be John the Baptist, that

123
00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:05.205
Elizabeth is going to bear a son

124
00:06:05.425 --> 00:06:06.965
and they have to name him John.

125
00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.205
Now that was overwhelming to begin with an angel showing up.

126
00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:13.605
But Zechariah initially, he doubted

127
00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:15.605
what this angel told him.

128
00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:16.725
He looked at his circumstances

129
00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:17.765
and said, well, how can that be?

130
00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.365
I mean, we're both old, right?

131
00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:21.205
So he doubted

132
00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:25.685
and God disciplined him by making him mute,

133
00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:27.765
meaning he can't speak.

134
00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:34.355
But in the same breath, the angel reminded Zechariah

135
00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:39.625
that God sent the angel to proclaim that message

136
00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:41.225
that it was God's word.

137
00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:44.185
So you should not doubt this zacharia.

138
00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:48.865
Well, he did. And yet he comes outta the temple

139
00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:50.345
and people obviously know something has happened

140
00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.465
because he can't speak and he's trying to make these motions

141
00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:53.985
and they didn't have sign language yet.

142
00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:55.665
So he's figuring out how to tell people

143
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:56.745
what happened, but they don't know.

144
00:06:56.885 --> 00:06:58.345
So eventually everybody just goes home.

145
00:06:58.345 --> 00:07:00.985
Well, lo and behold, soon

146
00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:03.905
after that day, his wife, Elizabeth, conceived

147
00:07:05.865 --> 00:07:07.445
God had fulfilled his promise, right?

148
00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:11.435
Like just as a sidebar, why do we ever doubt that he's going

149
00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:14.635
to, but we do all the time.

150
00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:18.655
Of course. And so nine months go by,

151
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:20.215
Elizabeth is pregnant.

152
00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:24.135
She's, she's growing of course in Zacharia the whole time.

153
00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:25.415
He still hasn't been able to talk.

154
00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:31.155
Well, Elizabeth gives birth to this baby boy and

155
00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:32.675
and they're custom at the time was

156
00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:34.715
to name the child on the eighth day.

157
00:07:35.895 --> 00:07:38.395
So everybody gathers for this big celebration, this big

158
00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:41.675
procedure process, whatever you would call it.

159
00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:44.835
And everyone just assumed that that baby was gonna be named

160
00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:46.315
after Zacharia his father.

161
00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:49.475
'cause that's what they did. Well watch what happens.

162
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:51.795
This is starting in verse 60 now,

163
00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:58.045
but his mother answered, this is Elizabeth,

164
00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.725
his mother answered, no, he shall be called John.

165
00:08:02.535 --> 00:08:04.755
And, and they said to her, none of your relatives is called

166
00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:06.515
by this name, meaning you're not following custom.

167
00:08:07.255 --> 00:08:10.835
And they made signs to his father, to Zechariah inquiring

168
00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:12.235
what he wanted him to be called.

169
00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:14.435
And Zacharia asked for writing tablet

170
00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:16.355
and wrote, his name is John.

171
00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:18.275
Now. Now notice something before we go forward.

172
00:08:18.735 --> 00:08:20.955
He had somehow communicated to Elizabeth

173
00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:23.555
that the baby was supposed to be named John, right?

174
00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:25.875
He couldn't speak, but he communicated, he,

175
00:08:25.975 --> 00:08:27.755
he got her to believe.

176
00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:31.035
So she said it, John, he says it by writing it down.

177
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:34.955
And everybody wondered, why, why John?

178
00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:40.105
And immediately verse 64, immediately his mouth was opened

179
00:08:40.365 --> 00:08:43.705
and his tongue loose and he spoke blessing God.

180
00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:46.235
We'll see what he said here in a moment.

181
00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:48.315
But fear came upon all their neighbors

182
00:08:48.315 --> 00:08:49.995
and all these things were talked about

183
00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:51.755
through all the hill country of Judea.

184
00:08:51.935 --> 00:08:53.955
All who heard them, laid them up in their hearts saying,

185
00:08:54.225 --> 00:08:58.725
what then will this child be for the hand of the Lord was

186
00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:00.685
with him, right?

187
00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:01.885
Everybody's amazed by this

188
00:09:01.885 --> 00:09:03.605
because God clearly had worked

189
00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:05.485
as Zacharia had overcome his doubt.

190
00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:09.005
He instructed his wife that they overcame their doubt.

191
00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:11.685
They saw God do miraculous things in their lives.

192
00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:14.725
And when he took the step of obedience to name the child,

193
00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:16.365
John, notice what happened.

194
00:09:16.585 --> 00:09:17.765
God opened his mouth again.

195
00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:23.655
And what did he say when he finally opened his mouth

196
00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:26.055
where he could finally bless God

197
00:09:26.055 --> 00:09:28.295
because he, he'd been storing it up for so long,

198
00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:30.215
he wanted to bless God.

199
00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:32.735
Well, in fact, that's what this has been called over the

200
00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:35.735
many centuries, this like we saw last week with Mary.

201
00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:39.975
The first word in the Latin language was Magnificat magnify.

202
00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:43.055
Here the first word is benedictus in Latin.

203
00:09:43.435 --> 00:09:44.615
That's what this one's called

204
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.455
because his first word is blessed be the God

205
00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:51.095
and Savior of our like.

206
00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:53.775
Like blessed be God here. You'll see it.

207
00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:54.895
Blessed be the Lord God.

208
00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:57.255
This is what he wants to do is he can't just help

209
00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:58.935
but spill out blessing.

210
00:10:01.315 --> 00:10:02.975
And that's gonna be our main passage today.

211
00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:06.775
Starting in verse 67, what did Zechariah prophecy

212
00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.855
prophesy in, in light of

213
00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:11.655
what he'd received from God all that he'd seen.

214
00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:14.375
Here's what he prophesied.

215
00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:16.695
His father Zechariah was filled

216
00:10:16.695 --> 00:10:18.615
with the Holy Spirit prophesied, saying,

217
00:10:19.325 --> 00:10:20.895
blessed, there it is.

218
00:10:21.405 --> 00:10:23.455
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.

219
00:10:24.115 --> 00:10:26.255
For he has visited and redeemed his people

220
00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:29.855
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house

221
00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:32.535
of his servant David, as he spoke by the mouth

222
00:10:32.535 --> 00:10:34.135
of his holy prophets from of old,

223
00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:36.495
that we should be saved from our enemies

224
00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:38.015
and from the hand of all who hate us,

225
00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:40.895
to show the mercy promise to our fathers

226
00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:44.775
to remember his holy covenant, the oath that he swore

227
00:10:44.775 --> 00:10:46.935
to our Father Abraham, to grant us

228
00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:49.095
that we being delivered from the hand

229
00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:52.895
of our enemies might serve him without fear and holiness

230
00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:54.295
and righteousness before him.

231
00:10:54.395 --> 00:10:58.915
All our days. And you child talking about John,

232
00:10:59.055 --> 00:11:02.035
you will be called the prophet of the most high for you,

233
00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:03.955
will go before the Lord to prepare his ways

234
00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:08.035
to give knowledge, salvation to his people, the forgiveness

235
00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:12.275
of their sins because of the tender mercy of our God,

236
00:11:13.065 --> 00:11:15.715
whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high

237
00:11:16.015 --> 00:11:18.675
to give light to those who sit in darkness in the shadow

238
00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:22.515
of death to guide our feet into the way of peace.

239
00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.445
So here's the interesting thing about his prophecy here.

240
00:11:30.305 --> 00:11:32.245
He actually talks about both children.

241
00:11:33.235 --> 00:11:34.645
He's not just talking about John,

242
00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:35.925
he's not just talking about Jesus.

243
00:11:36.075 --> 00:11:38.445
He's talking about both miracle babies, John

244
00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:43.005
and Jesus, the prophet of the most high and the most high.

245
00:11:44.065 --> 00:11:47.485
The one who's preparing the way and the way, right?

246
00:11:47.545 --> 00:11:50.325
So he, he's saying about both of them.

247
00:11:50.385 --> 00:11:52.725
And so first our, our challenge here is

248
00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:56.285
to understand John's role in redemption in this whole thing.

249
00:11:57.565 --> 00:12:00.165
'cause Zechariah is prophesying about miracle baby

250
00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:01.365
one, miracle baby two.

251
00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:05.245
And so, so what's John's role here as Zechariah,

252
00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:09.325
his father is prophetically describing what is happening.

253
00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:11.805
John's birth was miraculous.

254
00:12:12.095 --> 00:12:14.485
Jesus later said, no one's greater than John.

255
00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:18.845
So what's the deal here? How do we understand John's role?

256
00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:23.455
Well, first John was chosen by God from

257
00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:27.335
before he was born, to fulfill Elijah's prophetic function,

258
00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:32.405
to fulfill Elijah's prophetic function.

259
00:12:34.975 --> 00:12:37.185
This is what we saw. Whenever Zeer is in the temple,

260
00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:38.545
the angel's talking to him.

261
00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:43.435
What does he say? Verse 15, he will be filled

262
00:12:43.435 --> 00:12:45.835
with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.

263
00:12:46.295 --> 00:12:48.195
He will turn many of the children

264
00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:49.715
of Israel to the Lord their God.

265
00:12:50.335 --> 00:12:53.675
He will go before him. That's talking about the Messiah.

266
00:12:54.045 --> 00:12:55.835
He'll go before him in the spirit

267
00:12:55.935 --> 00:13:00.385
and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers

268
00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:01.425
to the children, to the

269
00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:03.745
and the disobedient, to the wisdom of the, just

270
00:13:03.885 --> 00:13:06.305
to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.

271
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:10.185
So Elijah, who was he?

272
00:13:10.565 --> 00:13:13.185
He was a preeminent prophet in the Old Testament.

273
00:13:13.445 --> 00:13:17.185
He was one that was seen al in many ways as a model prophet

274
00:13:17.435 --> 00:13:18.985
where he did battle with Ahab

275
00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:20.065
and Jezebel up on the mountain.

276
00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:21.745
That's a great story. Go read that.

277
00:13:21.805 --> 00:13:23.545
But, but he was seen as a model.

278
00:13:23.645 --> 00:13:27.225
And so in fact, he was so prevalent that he didn't even die.

279
00:13:28.445 --> 00:13:30.945
God took him to heaven in a fiery chariot.

280
00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:35.025
So what often happened later in Israel's history is they

281
00:13:35.025 --> 00:13:36.505
would think, oh, here's this prophet.

282
00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:38.625
Maybe that's Elijah coming back.

283
00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:41.665
Maybe that's Elijah not even reincarnated,

284
00:13:41.665 --> 00:13:43.385
he just coming back 'cause he never died in the first place

285
00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:45.265
they thought that of John.

286
00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.465
Now John was very clear. Jesus was clear.

287
00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:50.785
That's not Elijah reincarnated.

288
00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:54.465
But notice what the angel said.

289
00:13:54.645 --> 00:13:56.425
He was coming in the spirit

290
00:13:56.605 --> 00:13:58.385
and power of Elijah,

291
00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:00.715
meaning he's coming just like Elijah

292
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:01.875
came with the same power.

293
00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:05.675
Elijah came with and remember what Elijah's goal was?

294
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.395
His goal was to prepare the way of the Lord.

295
00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:11.675
That's what every prophet was to do, was try, try

296
00:14:11.675 --> 00:14:13.235
to ready the people to

297
00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:14.555
understand and believe in the Messiah.

298
00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:17.635
So his job was that John came in the same way.

299
00:14:20.155 --> 00:14:24.735
In fact, this was predicted at the end of the Old Testament,

300
00:14:26.275 --> 00:14:28.535
the last two verses of the Old Testament.

301
00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:30.855
Malachi four verses five and six.

302
00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:34.415
Behold I will send you Elijah, the prophet before the great

303
00:14:34.435 --> 00:14:36.015
and awesome day of the Lord comes

304
00:14:37.395 --> 00:14:40.095
and he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children

305
00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:42.615
and the hearts of children to their fathers.

306
00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.335
Lest I come and strike the land

307
00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:45.735
with a decree of utter destruction.

308
00:14:46.975 --> 00:14:48.065
Does that not sound familiar?

309
00:14:49.465 --> 00:14:51.270
That's what the angel said John's gonna do.

310
00:14:51.385 --> 00:14:54.245
John's a fulfillment of this passage, which is a fulfillment

311
00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:56.485
of Elijah and the prophetic vision

312
00:14:56.585 --> 00:15:00.005
of him being the forerunner of Messiah.

313
00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:07.155
Now remember, up until this point, God had been silent

314
00:15:07.255 --> 00:15:08.355
for 400 years.

315
00:15:10.015 --> 00:15:11.595
No prophets, no words.

316
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.395
Everybody was just kind of floating through it all hoping

317
00:15:16.055 --> 00:15:18.195
but 400 years of silence.

318
00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:21.995
And then John shows up carrying the mantle

319
00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.275
of the prophetic vision of Elijah.

320
00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:25.435
That's a huge deal

321
00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:29.275
because they would've known Malachi four, five, and six.

322
00:15:29.275 --> 00:15:32.635
They're saying, okay, something's different about this guy.

323
00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:37.325
Maybe now's the time that the Messiah is going to show up.

324
00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:40.285
That's what he did, right? He prepares the way.

325
00:15:40.295 --> 00:15:42.725
We'll see in a second prepares the way of the Messiah,

326
00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:46.365
calling people to repent, to ready their hearts for Christ

327
00:15:46.825 --> 00:15:50.635
and all that he would bring turning hearts,

328
00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:53.155
turning people to the Lord.

329
00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:59.375
But it wasn't hear, this wasn't just proclaiming repentance,

330
00:16:00.715 --> 00:16:02.375
it was also proclaiming Christ

331
00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:06.655
and that he would bring saving forgiveness when you repent.

332
00:16:08.315 --> 00:16:10.055
It wasn't just a generic repentance

333
00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:11.735
that you hope, man, I hope this works.

334
00:16:12.235 --> 00:16:14.055
It was repentance to forgiveness

335
00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:16.415
and that forgiveness comes in the Christ.

336
00:16:19.265 --> 00:16:21.865
Remember, that's what Zechariah prophesied John was going

337
00:16:21.885 --> 00:16:26.465
to do as a prophet in verse 77, to give knowledge of

338
00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:31.105
salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins.

339
00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:33.355
That was part of the deal.

340
00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:38.675
In fact, that's what Mark one four

341
00:16:38.675 --> 00:16:40.995
through eight says, John did.

342
00:16:42.855 --> 00:16:44.395
But notice how John viewed himself

343
00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:45.875
in relation to this Messiah.

344
00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:48.715
John was a great, and Jesus said great,

345
00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:52.795
and John was miraculous, but but notice John's perspective.

346
00:16:52.905 --> 00:16:54.795
John appeared baptizing in the wilderness,

347
00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:56.515
proclaiming a baptism of repentance

348
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.675
for the forgiveness of sins.

349
00:16:58.695 --> 00:17:00.955
All the country, Judas, Jerusalem were going out to him,

350
00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:04.395
being baptized by him in the river, confessing their sins.

351
00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:06.875
John was clothed with camel's hair

352
00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:08.315
and wore a leather belt around his

353
00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:09.955
waist, ate locusts and wild.

354
00:17:09.955 --> 00:17:11.155
Honey, I'm sure glad

355
00:17:11.215 --> 00:17:16.215
that's not the same thing anymore, but he preached.

356
00:17:16.275 --> 00:17:17.275
Notice what he says

357
00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:22.955
after me comes He who is mightier than I, the strap

358
00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:26.115
of whose sandals I'm not worthy to stoop down and untie.

359
00:17:27.585 --> 00:17:28.795
I've baptized you with water,

360
00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:32.315
but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

361
00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:37.975
Like John great, amazing forerunner of the Messiah.

362
00:17:37.975 --> 00:17:40.175
And he looked at it like, no, no, no. That's about him.

363
00:17:41.575 --> 00:17:44.715
In fact, John won later he makes it even more clear

364
00:17:45.255 --> 00:17:46.555
at Jesus' baptism.

365
00:17:46.855 --> 00:17:48.315
He says, the next day he saw,

366
00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:50.365
John saw Jesus coming toward him

367
00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:52.325
and said, behold the lamb of God

368
00:17:52.325 --> 00:17:53.685
who takes away the sin of the world.

369
00:17:54.995 --> 00:17:56.605
This is the one of whom I've said

370
00:17:56.695 --> 00:17:58.845
after me comes a man who ranks before me

371
00:17:58.845 --> 00:18:00.405
because he was before me.

372
00:18:00.405 --> 00:18:01.805
Meaning he existed before me.

373
00:18:02.245 --> 00:18:03.325
I myself didn't know him,

374
00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:06.605
but for this purpose I came baptizing with water

375
00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.085
that he might be revealed to Israel.

376
00:18:10.075 --> 00:18:14.615
Right? You see that John's purpose was

377
00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:16.815
to point to Christ.

378
00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:21.095
He wanted to let Israel know that salvation had come.

379
00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:23.575
But it, it's not the same as you might think, Israel.

380
00:18:25.515 --> 00:18:27.615
You've been waiting for a political messiah,

381
00:18:28.325 --> 00:18:30.655
freedom from Rome, get your land back.

382
00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:33.655
Salvation is not merely political.

383
00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:35.455
Salvation is not merely social.

384
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:39.255
He's saying to them in this salvation, first

385
00:18:39.315 --> 00:18:41.735
and foremost is a problem internally

386
00:18:42.045 --> 00:18:43.615
that you have, it's called sin.

387
00:18:43.675 --> 00:18:45.975
That's what you need to be saved from.

388
00:18:45.975 --> 00:18:46.855
First and foremost,

389
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.445
even looking at all the temple sacrifices throughout the

390
00:18:53.445 --> 00:18:57.845
generations should have pointed them to the true lamb

391
00:18:57.865 --> 00:18:59.845
of God, the spotless one

392
00:18:59.845 --> 00:19:01.445
who could take away their sin forever.

393
00:19:04.165 --> 00:19:05.735
He's saying, guys, this is it. He's here.

394
00:19:05.805 --> 00:19:08.895
Look, the lamb of God is here.

395
00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:13.765
So that was John's role.

396
00:19:13.905 --> 00:19:15.845
He, he was solely focused on

397
00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:17.085
pointing the way to the Messiah.

398
00:19:17.085 --> 00:19:19.445
He must increase, I must decrease. That's his heart.

399
00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:25.065
But that good news of great joy that he was proclaiming

400
00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:28.045
should now lead us to,

401
00:19:28.205 --> 00:19:31.045
to more deeply look at God's role in redemption

402
00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:32.325
according to Zechariah.

403
00:19:33.545 --> 00:19:36.445
So John's role, we saw it's clear from this passage

404
00:19:36.515 --> 00:19:38.045
what he's supposed to do, but,

405
00:19:38.305 --> 00:19:39.645
but Jesus was greater than John.

406
00:19:39.665 --> 00:19:43.695
So let's focus on him. What did God do?

407
00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:45.335
What is God doing in redemption?

408
00:19:47.535 --> 00:19:49.785
What we learned first here is, is

409
00:19:49.785 --> 00:19:51.665
that God fulfills the prophecies.

410
00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:53.975
That's the first point

411
00:19:54.805 --> 00:19:57.615
that we see about redemption in God's role is

412
00:19:57.615 --> 00:19:58.895
that he fulfills the prophecies.

413
00:19:58.895 --> 00:20:02.775
This is just like we saw last week with Mary's song, a lot

414
00:20:02.775 --> 00:20:06.215
of references to the Old Testament, the promises God gave.

415
00:20:06.315 --> 00:20:09.695
You see it even here, verse 70, God spoke about this horn

416
00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:12.455
of salvation from David's house that's prophetic.

417
00:20:12.715 --> 00:20:15.015
The holy prophets of old verse 71

418
00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:16.575
to save them from their enemies.

419
00:20:16.575 --> 00:20:18.415
That's all predicted.

420
00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:21.775
Verse 72, God did all this to show his tender.

421
00:20:21.775 --> 00:20:24.415
Mercy promised to their fathers,

422
00:20:25.815 --> 00:20:28.835
God remembered his covenant prophetic language.

423
00:20:28.835 --> 00:20:32.675
Verse 73, God swore an oath, a promise to Abraham

424
00:20:33.605 --> 00:20:35.195
again and again throughout history,

425
00:20:35.425 --> 00:20:36.875
that God would deliver his people.

426
00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:39.475
This is all God taking these promises.

427
00:20:39.695 --> 00:20:42.595
And when Jesus shows up, hundreds

428
00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:44.555
of prophecies were fulfilled

429
00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:48.095
and many, many more will be

430
00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:49.415
fulfilled in the future through him.

431
00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:52.575
So, so what he's saying in this is, God, you can trust this.

432
00:20:54.435 --> 00:20:57.935
You can trust that I'm coming through for salvation,

433
00:20:58.275 --> 00:21:00.655
but you can trust that all the promises I'm making

434
00:21:00.715 --> 00:21:02.135
for you will also be fulfilled.

435
00:21:02.785 --> 00:21:04.665
Maybe not in the way you want or think,

436
00:21:04.845 --> 00:21:07.025
but they will trust me.

437
00:21:09.965 --> 00:21:11.985
So God's role in redemption first is

438
00:21:11.985 --> 00:21:13.825
to fulfill his promises.

439
00:21:13.825 --> 00:21:15.865
But there's one specific way God does that.

440
00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:18.265
Zacharia says it's by delivering his people.

441
00:21:20.075 --> 00:21:21.335
God delivers his people.

442
00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:25.805
And that's verse 74 specifically, which

443
00:21:26.605 --> 00:21:29.525
actually recalls the exodus in the Old Testament.

444
00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:33.805
You remember when, when Moses goes up

445
00:21:33.805 --> 00:21:36.285
to Pharaoh, God told him to do this.

446
00:21:36.285 --> 00:21:37.445
Moses goes to Pharaoh

447
00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:42.525
and he demands that God's people be released from

448
00:21:42.545 --> 00:21:46.045
the slavery they'd been in in Egypt for 400 years, right?

449
00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:49.185
He goes up to to Pharaoh and what does he say?

450
00:21:50.445 --> 00:21:53.185
You know this Charlton Hesston, right? Let my people go.

451
00:21:55.725 --> 00:21:59.865
But that was not all He said, if you remember, he said,

452
00:21:59.965 --> 00:22:01.065
let my people go.

453
00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:04.605
But what else did he say

454
00:22:05.595 --> 00:22:08.405
that they may serve the Lord in the wilderness?

455
00:22:10.075 --> 00:22:11.985
There was a reason. Let my people go

456
00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:14.665
so they may serve the Lord in the wilderness.

457
00:22:14.685 --> 00:22:17.745
Now listen again to what Zacharia said in Luke chapter

458
00:22:18.325 --> 00:22:19.505
one, verse 74.

459
00:22:20.045 --> 00:22:22.305
He says that we being delivered from the hand

460
00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:26.865
of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness

461
00:22:26.905 --> 00:22:29.145
and righteousness before him all our days.

462
00:22:31.635 --> 00:22:34.415
And so God's giving a physical illustration here

463
00:22:35.445 --> 00:22:39.425
of the deliverance of his people from the land of Egypt.

464
00:22:39.655 --> 00:22:41.905
He's saying to them now, in this context,

465
00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:43.585
I'm gonna do it spiritually.

466
00:22:45.185 --> 00:22:47.155
What you saw happen, what you remember

467
00:22:47.295 --> 00:22:50.395
and recall happening from ex, from the Exodus narrative,

468
00:22:52.085 --> 00:22:53.495
it's gonna happen spiritually too.

469
00:22:55.515 --> 00:22:58.695
You're gonna be saved from your enemies, the enemy

470
00:22:58.695 --> 00:23:03.565
of sin mostly and be free to serve me.

471
00:23:06.015 --> 00:23:09.435
So God delivers his people in redemption.

472
00:23:09.435 --> 00:23:10.395
That's what he does for us.

473
00:23:13.485 --> 00:23:14.935
There's another piece of this.

474
00:23:15.075 --> 00:23:16.695
He shows us, Zachariah does

475
00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.775
that God provides the light we need in redemption.

476
00:23:21.035 --> 00:23:23.375
He provides light that we need.

477
00:23:24.845 --> 00:23:26.895
Look again at the last two verses 78

478
00:23:26.895 --> 00:23:31.715
and 79 here, Whereby the

479
00:23:31.715 --> 00:23:36.475
sunrise shall visit us from on high to give light to those

480
00:23:36.475 --> 00:23:39.475
who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.

481
00:23:41.955 --> 00:23:44.975
Now, if you know your timeline, you know that at this,

482
00:23:45.085 --> 00:23:47.085
this point when Zechariah is saying this,

483
00:23:47.735 --> 00:23:49.445
Jesus has not been born yet.

484
00:23:50.145 --> 00:23:51.445
That's actually the next chapter.

485
00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:56.845
And so though the dawn was beginning to glimmer

486
00:23:57.785 --> 00:24:01.525
in the eastern sky, the sunrise hadn't happened yet.

487
00:24:02.845 --> 00:24:05.645
'cause the sunrise we're talking about the savior Messiah.

488
00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.365
It hadn't fully come yet,

489
00:24:08.365 --> 00:24:09.685
but you're starting to see glimpses.

490
00:24:09.685 --> 00:24:10.805
You're starting to see things happen

491
00:24:11.275 --> 00:24:12.445
like you see in the morning, right?

492
00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:15.805
You start to see some lights shining a little bit brighter,

493
00:24:15.865 --> 00:24:18.405
but you don't see the sunrise until a specific moment.

494
00:24:18.405 --> 00:24:20.365
That's what we're still waiting for.

495
00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:25.855
Now here's, here's part of just biblical theology,

496
00:24:25.885 --> 00:24:27.375
understanding darkness.

497
00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:30.835
When you understand darkness in God's word,

498
00:24:31.225 --> 00:24:35.835
it's used all over as a stand-in for sin, for evil,

499
00:24:36.855 --> 00:24:41.005
for lostness, it's used as as a way

500
00:24:41.005 --> 00:24:42.885
that people are talked about.

501
00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:44.725
Where they are separated from God.

502
00:24:44.725 --> 00:24:46.565
They're living according to their own flesh.

503
00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:49.645
That's darkness that happens all over God's word.

504
00:24:51.265 --> 00:24:53.245
Now that is partly external

505
00:24:54.955 --> 00:24:56.645
that it's just we live in a dark world and

506
00:24:56.645 --> 00:24:58.205
and listen, it doesn't take very long to look

507
00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:00.125
through the news or to scroll through your social media

508
00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:02.205
and see that this is a really dark place.

509
00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:07.185
And so there's a bit of darkness that's external to us.

510
00:25:07.325 --> 00:25:10.425
We understand that. But really also there's an internal

511
00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.145
reality of darkness.

512
00:25:13.205 --> 00:25:16.405
All of us, Romans 1 21 says,

513
00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:19.525
although they knew God, they did not honor him as God

514
00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:20.845
or give thanks to him,

515
00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:23.405
but they became futile in their thinking

516
00:25:23.705 --> 00:25:26.605
and their foolish hearts were darkened.

517
00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:31.685
That's you and me, every one of us.

518
00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:36.015
That's why we needed this light, this sunrise

519
00:25:38.805 --> 00:25:42.105
as Isaiah nine verse two promised 700 years

520
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:43.825
before Jesus came, the people

521
00:25:43.885 --> 00:25:46.705
who walked in darkness have seen a great light.

522
00:25:47.395 --> 00:25:48.625
Those who dwell in a land

523
00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:51.985
of deep darkness on them has light shown.

524
00:25:54.975 --> 00:25:57.275
But here, here's what I know. I've thought of.

525
00:25:57.275 --> 00:25:58.675
This is kind of my thought process.

526
00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:00.155
I know others have as well.

527
00:26:00.155 --> 00:26:04.195
When we hear the word sunrise, we tend to think

528
00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:06.035
of something very pleasant, don't we?

529
00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:11.315
Like you think of on your back porch, it's a nice morning.

530
00:26:11.415 --> 00:26:12.555
You got your Bible out.

531
00:26:12.575 --> 00:26:14.955
You see deer kind of traipsing through your backyard

532
00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:17.875
and the sunrise is just beginning to creep up.

533
00:26:17.875 --> 00:26:22.035
You got your nice warm co, I mean tea there with it and,

534
00:26:22.055 --> 00:26:23.955
and it's just like you know you.

535
00:26:23.975 --> 00:26:27.395
You see this sense of of pleasant. This is peaceful.

536
00:26:30.425 --> 00:26:34.205
But if, if this darkness is so pervasive,

537
00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:40.065
that kind of a sunrise would not have anything to do

538
00:26:40.735 --> 00:26:42.945
with overcoming this kind of darkness, right?

539
00:26:44.955 --> 00:26:48.085
Sunrise is pleasant in our minds, but, but watch this.

540
00:26:50.195 --> 00:26:52.055
Listen to the rest of Isaiah nine

541
00:26:52.065 --> 00:26:55.895
after what he said in verse two, verses three through seven,

542
00:26:57.845 --> 00:27:00.455
that light right has come.

543
00:27:01.475 --> 00:27:04.575
You have multiplied the nation, you've increased its joy.

544
00:27:04.925 --> 00:27:07.775
They rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest

545
00:27:08.195 --> 00:27:11.175
as they are glad when they divide the spoil Now.

546
00:27:11.175 --> 00:27:13.895
Now we're doing okay at this point still sitting on the back

547
00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:16.095
porch, Instagramming our quiet times, right?

548
00:27:16.115 --> 00:27:20.955
So let's feel good. But then verse

549
00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:22.395
four, for the yoke of his burden

550
00:27:22.655 --> 00:27:26.075
and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor,

551
00:27:26.855 --> 00:27:30.155
you've broken as on the day of Midian,

552
00:27:32.175 --> 00:27:35.315
for every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult

553
00:27:35.315 --> 00:27:38.635
and every garment rolled in blood will be burned

554
00:27:38.775 --> 00:27:40.115
as fuel for the fire.

555
00:27:41.955 --> 00:27:46.545
Oh, for to us, a child is born to us.

556
00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:49.305
A son is given. The government shall be upon his shoulder,

557
00:27:49.305 --> 00:27:50.545
meaning he's taken over

558
00:27:50.765 --> 00:27:53.225
and his name shall be called wonderful counselor,

559
00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:56.745
mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace, of the

560
00:27:57.265 --> 00:27:58.905
increase of his government and of peace.

561
00:27:58.985 --> 00:28:02.745
There will be no end on the throne of David over his kingdom

562
00:28:02.885 --> 00:28:04.425
to establish it, to uphold it

563
00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:06.305
with justice, with righteousness.

564
00:28:06.575 --> 00:28:10.025
From this time forth forevermore, the zeal of the Lord

565
00:28:10.025 --> 00:28:11.905
of hosts will do this.

566
00:28:13.605 --> 00:28:16.545
And so the sunrise shows up

567
00:28:16.765 --> 00:28:19.025
and it's not all Instagram pleasantries,

568
00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:21.705
it's battle to bring peace.

569
00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:26.745
Who's he battling? He's battling his enemies.

570
00:28:28.305 --> 00:28:29.645
So the sunrise shows up

571
00:28:29.785 --> 00:28:31.445
and it's not just this kind

572
00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:35.645
of peaceful little candle in a cave kinda light figure.

573
00:28:35.945 --> 00:28:39.565
It is this blazing SUN sun coming

574
00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:42.765
to drive away every shadow and every sorrow

575
00:28:42.765 --> 00:28:45.045
and every sinfulness that's in the world,

576
00:28:46.565 --> 00:28:47.715
every one of his enemies.

577
00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.795
That's what the sunrise is.

578
00:28:53.915 --> 00:28:58.575
It is fear inducing for those who are in darkness, for those

579
00:28:58.595 --> 00:29:00.375
who are walking in darkness.

580
00:29:00.475 --> 00:29:02.575
Not, not those, those of us who are in darkness,

581
00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:03.735
but we see the light.

582
00:29:03.885 --> 00:29:06.095
It's those of us in darkness that don't see the light

583
00:29:06.095 --> 00:29:07.815
and are walking in darkness and enjoy it.

584
00:29:09.775 --> 00:29:11.955
And we see that's what we want.

585
00:29:12.485 --> 00:29:15.315
Where his enemy, we don't have peace with God.

586
00:29:15.495 --> 00:29:19.545
That's what he brings. It's bad news.

587
00:29:23.015 --> 00:29:26.115
And so that salvation, that redemption is both external.

588
00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:27.715
That because the Lord is my light,

589
00:29:27.775 --> 00:29:29.355
my salvation, whom should I fear?

590
00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:32.155
And we should have no fear of anything

591
00:29:32.155 --> 00:29:33.835
because he is that light.

592
00:29:34.295 --> 00:29:38.355
But that's also an internal reality of his

593
00:29:38.865 --> 00:29:43.685
walking us into that light, which is what Acts chapter 26,

594
00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:47.165
verse 18 actually says that God sent Paul

595
00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:51.725
to open their eyes so they may turn from darkness to light,

596
00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:53.765
from the power of Satan to God

597
00:29:53.915 --> 00:29:56.965
that they may receive forgiveness of sins in a place

598
00:29:56.965 --> 00:30:00.245
among those who are sanctified by faith in me.

599
00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:04.765
It's what Jesus said, John eight 12,

600
00:30:05.325 --> 00:30:07.485
I am the light of the world.

601
00:30:08.955 --> 00:30:13.755
I am the sunrise. Whoever follows me will not walk

602
00:30:13.755 --> 00:30:16.875
in darkness but will have the light of life.

603
00:30:20.115 --> 00:30:22.965
Okay? The sunrise is here. How are you gonna respond?

604
00:30:23.105 --> 00:30:24.125
Is basically what he says.

605
00:30:25.385 --> 00:30:28.205
You got life, you got light if you're in me.

606
00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:32.245
But you walk in darkness and you see what happens to that.

607
00:30:34.105 --> 00:30:38.325
And so when he comes into a life, the light of life comes in

608
00:30:38.745 --> 00:30:42.125
and and that that light drives away darkness

609
00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:43.365
even inside your heart.

610
00:30:43.625 --> 00:30:47.805
And what that is, is a foretaste of that blazing glory

611
00:30:47.835 --> 00:30:50.405
that he's going to come burn away all the darkness once

612
00:30:50.405 --> 00:30:51.445
and for all someday in the future.

613
00:30:52.595 --> 00:30:55.075
What he does in us now is a glimpse of

614
00:30:55.075 --> 00:30:56.275
what he's coming to do someday.

615
00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:00.925
He brings the light we need.

616
00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:05.165
But here's what that light is intended to do.

617
00:31:06.525 --> 00:31:09.645
Zechariah actually says it this way in Zechariah one, uh,

618
00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:13.365
Luke 1 79, the very last verse, very last phrase,

619
00:31:13.875 --> 00:31:16.605
this light comes, it says

620
00:31:16.905 --> 00:31:19.965
to guide our feet into the way of peace.

621
00:31:21.265 --> 00:31:25.965
God leads us into peace. This is redemption.

622
00:31:25.965 --> 00:31:28.365
This is part of redemption. He leads us into peace.

623
00:31:28.385 --> 00:31:30.845
Now, they would've seen that freedom from oppression.

624
00:31:31.185 --> 00:31:32.965
No more Rome. We get our land back.

625
00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:37.225
But we can also understand today

626
00:31:37.225 --> 00:31:39.585
that the king values God brings through his people.

627
00:31:39.925 --> 00:31:41.945
That's peace on earth. Yes.

628
00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:43.625
And that's coming one day forever.

629
00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:45.345
We can praise the Lord for that.

630
00:31:45.365 --> 00:31:48.705
But more importantly, it's a peace with God.

631
00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:54.965
He brings peace, leads us into peace. We are enemies.

632
00:31:54.975 --> 00:31:56.765
We're opposed to him. We're in the darkness

633
00:31:56.795 --> 00:31:57.845
separated from him.

634
00:31:58.225 --> 00:32:02.285
Yet Romans five, one, since we've been justified by faith,

635
00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:05.925
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

636
00:32:08.025 --> 00:32:11.855
Forgiveness an enemy now a child,

637
00:32:12.195 --> 00:32:14.895
his perfect life, substitutionary death,

638
00:32:15.105 --> 00:32:18.735
victorious resurrection makes you a child of God instead

639
00:32:18.735 --> 00:32:21.735
of an enemy of God gives you peace

640
00:32:22.085 --> 00:32:24.095
with God when you place your faith

641
00:32:24.735 --> 00:32:26.375
specifically in Jesus's work for you.

642
00:32:26.835 --> 00:32:28.935
That's good news of great joy.

643
00:32:31.705 --> 00:32:34.345
But That brings up the last piece

644
00:32:34.345 --> 00:32:35.785
of zechariah's prophecy here.

645
00:32:36.765 --> 00:32:38.585
We saw John's role, we saw God's role.

646
00:32:39.945 --> 00:32:42.445
What's our role in redemption?

647
00:32:44.555 --> 00:32:47.655
What's the role we play in redemption?

648
00:32:50.065 --> 00:32:53.235
Well, here's a short answer. Nothing.

649
00:32:56.495 --> 00:32:59.795
This is all of God, right?

650
00:32:59.915 --> 00:33:03.315
This is, this is clear from this whole passage

651
00:33:03.895 --> 00:33:04.915
as you work through this.

652
00:33:05.495 --> 00:33:07.475
God visited God redeemed.

653
00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:11.155
God promised God provided God showed mercy.

654
00:33:11.655 --> 00:33:15.015
God made the covenant. In fact, the universe, 73,

655
00:33:15.015 --> 00:33:17.775
notice it says, God granted us.

656
00:33:18.165 --> 00:33:19.415
That means it's a gift.

657
00:33:21.095 --> 00:33:23.985
Then verse 74, that we even the tense matters

658
00:33:24.175 --> 00:33:26.665
that we being delivered.

659
00:33:27.555 --> 00:33:28.735
That's passive, right?

660
00:33:29.515 --> 00:33:31.055
That's not like you delivering yourself.

661
00:33:31.055 --> 00:33:33.495
That's you're sitting here, you're being delivered

662
00:33:33.605 --> 00:33:34.855
like the claw and toy story.

663
00:33:35.035 --> 00:33:37.415
You get chosen, right? That's being delivered.

664
00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:43.735
God does it. You see, God sent the sunrise.

665
00:33:44.195 --> 00:33:46.455
God gives light to those in darkness.

666
00:33:46.555 --> 00:33:49.215
God guides our feet into the way of peace.

667
00:33:49.245 --> 00:33:51.415
What that means is that this is all of grace.

668
00:33:54.205 --> 00:33:56.135
This is all of grace.

669
00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:57.335
Redemption's a gift

670
00:33:57.365 --> 00:33:59.975
because he loves us even though we don't deserve it,

671
00:34:00.155 --> 00:34:01.655
God gives us grace.

672
00:34:01.805 --> 00:34:03.215
It's what Ephesians two says.

673
00:34:03.435 --> 00:34:05.295
So well, even including the faith element,

674
00:34:05.435 --> 00:34:10.055
we might wonder about Ephesians 2, 8, 9.

675
00:34:11.155 --> 00:34:15.575
For by grace you have been saved through faith.

676
00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:18.055
And this is not your own doing.

677
00:34:18.595 --> 00:34:23.095
It is the gift of God, not a result of works so

678
00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:24.175
that no one may boast.

679
00:34:26.615 --> 00:34:28.995
Romans 11 says, if it's by works, it's not by grace anymore.

680
00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:34.145
This is a gift. It's by God's grace alone.

681
00:34:34.245 --> 00:34:36.345
You can't earn it because if you could earn it,

682
00:34:36.365 --> 00:34:38.465
you would start boasting about it that you were the one

683
00:34:38.465 --> 00:34:41.185
who figured it out or you were in this small subset

684
00:34:41.325 --> 00:34:43.225
of people that were good enough to earn it.

685
00:34:43.445 --> 00:34:46.705
No, you cannot earn it. So you can't boast about it.

686
00:34:46.895 --> 00:34:48.185
It's just like this holiday season.

687
00:34:48.325 --> 00:34:52.305
So check this out, workspace salvation is

688
00:34:52.595 --> 00:34:53.865
everywhere right now.

689
00:34:55.245 --> 00:34:56.585
And I'm not just talking theologically.

690
00:34:56.605 --> 00:34:58.905
I'm talking about when you talk about presence

691
00:34:59.205 --> 00:35:03.345
or coal in your socking, what's the question?

692
00:35:05.325 --> 00:35:09.655
Have you been a good boy? Have you been a good girl?

693
00:35:10.715 --> 00:35:13.055
Oh, You're gonna get coal or you're gonna get presence.

694
00:35:13.515 --> 00:35:15.375
That's works based salvation, isn't it?

695
00:35:16.785 --> 00:35:20.115
It's it's subtly feeding into this reality that we have

696
00:35:20.115 --> 00:35:21.235
to earn it some way.

697
00:35:21.235 --> 00:35:25.115
That's not how this works. You get the gift of redemption,

698
00:35:25.345 --> 00:35:27.515
even though you could not be good enough at all

699
00:35:29.785 --> 00:35:32.795
when you place your faith in the fact that Jesus

700
00:35:33.415 --> 00:35:36.675
was good enough for you, that's when you get presence.

701
00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:41.345
You're completely deserving of the coal. Absolutely you are.

702
00:35:43.075 --> 00:35:44.255
But he was good enough for you.

703
00:35:44.315 --> 00:35:46.015
And you say, he's good enough for me.

704
00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:49.475
I'm placing my faith in him. And you get presence.

705
00:35:50.545 --> 00:35:52.995
It's grace. It is grace.

706
00:35:55.065 --> 00:35:57.475
Good news of great joy, right?

707
00:35:59.695 --> 00:36:01.355
But I want you to see something about that grace.

708
00:36:02.775 --> 00:36:07.295
It's for a purpose that grace is for a purpose.

709
00:36:09.635 --> 00:36:13.895
We already saw the exodus motif come out again in verse 74,

710
00:36:13.895 --> 00:36:17.575
that image of God delivering his people for a reason.

711
00:36:17.995 --> 00:36:19.455
Did you see why he did it?

712
00:36:19.915 --> 00:36:21.975
Why did God deliver his people from Egypt?

713
00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:24.415
Why does he deliver his people today?

714
00:36:24.565 --> 00:36:26.455
It's the same reason verse 74,

715
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:29.335
that we being delivered from the hand

716
00:36:29.335 --> 00:36:33.895
of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness

717
00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:36.735
and righteousness before Him all our days.

718
00:36:37.915 --> 00:36:40.015
Listen, God's redeeming deliverance is not

719
00:36:40.015 --> 00:36:41.135
so you can have a cushy life.

720
00:36:41.445 --> 00:36:43.375
It's not that you can have everything you would ever want.

721
00:36:43.645 --> 00:36:46.975
It's so that you would serve him freely now

722
00:36:48.485 --> 00:36:50.465
and you're not enslaved to everything you were before.

723
00:36:50.645 --> 00:36:53.785
You're free. You're free from the fear

724
00:36:53.805 --> 00:36:56.185
of the enemy being able to touch you anymore.

725
00:36:56.365 --> 00:36:59.345
You're free from the reality that God might cast you away.

726
00:36:59.405 --> 00:37:00.865
You don't have to worry about anymore.

727
00:37:00.965 --> 00:37:03.385
You're free to live a life fit for him

728
00:37:03.645 --> 00:37:06.265
and empowered by him to follow him.

729
00:37:08.105 --> 00:37:09.685
You're saved to serve.

730
00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:15.405
You are freed from your sin to be a servant to God.

731
00:37:18.645 --> 00:37:20.625
And that's notice all your days, he said

732
00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:22.265
that was in there all your days.

733
00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:26.865
That means there is no retirement age in serving the Lord

734
00:37:28.685 --> 00:37:30.825
All your days and hear me, kids, students,

735
00:37:31.975 --> 00:37:33.665
there's not a minimum age either.

736
00:37:35.645 --> 00:37:38.665
All your days, zero to

737
00:37:38.665 --> 00:37:42.065
however long you live, all your days saved

738
00:37:42.445 --> 00:37:45.225
to serve the Lord freely.

739
00:37:47.075 --> 00:37:48.655
And there's one primary way we do that

740
00:37:50.795 --> 00:37:55.015
by being a carrier of that light to the dark world

741
00:37:55.015 --> 00:37:58.305
around us might think of it this way.

742
00:37:58.975 --> 00:38:00.945
It's kinda like you're carrying the flashlight. Now.

743
00:38:01.845 --> 00:38:03.585
I'm not gonna turn on 'cause you're blinded. You're right.

744
00:38:05.565 --> 00:38:08.625
You are not the SUN son.

745
00:38:10.845 --> 00:38:14.115
You're not the son we've already seen all morning.

746
00:38:14.115 --> 00:38:18.275
That's Jesus, right? That's the sunrise. He is the son.

747
00:38:18.655 --> 00:38:22.835
But, but listen to what Jesus said about you now believer.

748
00:38:24.785 --> 00:38:27.035
This is Matthew five 14 through 16.

749
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:30.315
He says, you are the light of the world.

750
00:38:32.965 --> 00:38:34.645
A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,

751
00:38:34.985 --> 00:38:37.285
nor do people light a lamp or turn a flashlight on

752
00:38:37.425 --> 00:38:40.845
and put it under a basket, but they put it on a stand.

753
00:38:40.945 --> 00:38:42.445
It gives light to all in the house.

754
00:38:43.425 --> 00:38:46.925
In the same way, let your light shine

755
00:38:47.345 --> 00:38:49.925
before others so that they may see your good works

756
00:38:49.985 --> 00:38:53.205
and give glory to your father who is in heaven.

757
00:38:54.405 --> 00:38:58.625
And so check this out. The light has made you

758
00:38:59.145 --> 00:39:02.825
a smaller light so he can shine brightly through you

759
00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:07.495
and he gets the glory Like your light is not focused on

760
00:39:07.695 --> 00:39:09.615
anything but like spotlighting him

761
00:39:12.235 --> 00:39:14.375
as you live the life, as you empower,

762
00:39:14.395 --> 00:39:16.135
as he's empowered you to live this life.

763
00:39:16.135 --> 00:39:18.975
You're just constantly pointing to him.

764
00:39:19.235 --> 00:39:21.535
Now, what else are you doing? You're also, in a way,

765
00:39:21.835 --> 00:39:26.455
as you carry this light, you're helping to guide others into

766
00:39:26.455 --> 00:39:29.735
what that verse said, the way of peace that you're on.

767
00:39:31.625 --> 00:39:34.045
You see how that works? People are walking in darkness.

768
00:39:34.425 --> 00:39:37.005
You have the light of the world shining through you

769
00:39:37.065 --> 00:39:40.685
so you can help guide someone else into that way of peace.

770
00:39:43.895 --> 00:39:45.195
Now, I'm not just making that up.

771
00:39:45.535 --> 00:39:49.035
That's what second Corinthians five actually says in a way

772
00:39:49.035 --> 00:39:52.755
for us to understand how to do this, that we are to do this

773
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:55.155
and we hear the word reconciliation,

774
00:39:55.205 --> 00:39:56.955
think peace with God here.

775
00:39:59.345 --> 00:40:02.035
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation.

776
00:40:02.215 --> 00:40:04.275
The oldest passed away, the new light has come.

777
00:40:05.755 --> 00:40:07.135
All this is from God.

778
00:40:07.865 --> 00:40:11.815
Grace who through Christ reconciled us to himself,

779
00:40:11.965 --> 00:40:16.875
gave us the ministry of reconciliation that is in Christ.

780
00:40:16.935 --> 00:40:18.875
God was reconciling the world to himself,

781
00:40:19.135 --> 00:40:21.875
not counting their trespasses against them, entrusting

782
00:40:21.895 --> 00:40:26.395
to us the message of reconciliation of peace with God.

783
00:40:27.955 --> 00:40:32.165
Therefore, four, because of that reconciliation,

784
00:40:32.505 --> 00:40:34.405
we are ambassadors for Christ.

785
00:40:37.575 --> 00:40:39.395
God making his appeal through us.

786
00:40:39.455 --> 00:40:44.275
We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

787
00:40:44.455 --> 00:40:47.395
So see this church, God's promise,

788
00:40:47.465 --> 00:40:49.675
deliverance was all of grace.

789
00:40:49.815 --> 00:40:51.635
You can't light this thing up yourself.

790
00:40:51.935 --> 00:40:55.395
God gave it to you by his grace. We don't deserve it yet.

791
00:40:55.395 --> 00:40:59.615
He gave it anyway. And it was for a purpose.

792
00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:04.955
It was to serve him as a new holy

793
00:41:05.715 --> 00:41:09.355
creation without fear, where we're now his ambassadors

794
00:41:09.495 --> 00:41:11.555
of light in a dark world around us.

795
00:41:11.555 --> 00:41:14.155
That's what he gave us the gift to do.

796
00:41:15.095 --> 00:41:16.835
And so may that be true of US church.

797
00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:20.165
May we be transformed,

798
00:41:21.335 --> 00:41:23.925
light bearers different in the way we live,

799
00:41:26.615 --> 00:41:30.715
living scent, carrying that light to everyone around us.

800
00:41:32.185 --> 00:41:33.205
May that be so church.
