1
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.800
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.560
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God,

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.840
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.

4
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.680
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.200
When Christ who is your life appears,

6
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.520
then you will also appear with him and glory.

7
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.480
He is the image of the invisible God,

8
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.760
the firstborn of all creation.

9
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.920
For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth,

10
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.920
visible and invisible.

11
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.920
Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities,

12
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.200
all things were created through him and for him.

13
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.240
And he is before all things. And in him all things hold together.

14
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.840
And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning,

15
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.720
the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be preeminent

16
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.653
for in Him,

17
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.040
all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell and through him,

18
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.840
to reconcile to himself all things,

19
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440
whether on earth or in heaven,

20
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.760
making peace by the blood of his cross.

21
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.880
And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil

22
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.963
deeds,

23
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.920
he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to

24
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.480
present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him.

25
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.120
If indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast,

26
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.760
not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard,

27
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.360
which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,

28
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.040
Paul became a minister.

29
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.600
I want you to imagine for a second that there is a massive throne sitting right

30
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.560
here in front of me. Like where a, a king would sit in his palace like,

31
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.960
like just imagine a throne. You got that in your mind, right? So, so right here,

32
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.120
there's a throne sitting here.

33
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.280
And then I want you to imagine that Jesus himself was sitting here on

34
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.560
that throne like in person, that same Jesus yesterday, today, forever.

35
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.720
He's sitting right here.

36
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.840
How would the atmosphere in this room change?

37
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.920
Like would we,

38
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.880
would we be sitting there kind of half asleep looking at this like, oh,

39
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.800
that's pretty cool. You know, like no, right? We,

40
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.680
we would see Jesus like this. We'd be our faces in awe and wonder.

41
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.840
We would be just overwhelmed.

42
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.360
Humility and brokenness would come out of our hearts. We'd have joy and worship.

43
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.960
We'd be crying, we'd be singing, we'd be all the things right?

44
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.440
Lemme fill you in on a little secret. You don't have to imagine that

45
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.480
because his presence is right here among us just

46
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.400
as if he'd be sitting right here in front of us.

47
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.280
And so the question we need to ask is why don't we respond like I just

48
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.200
described, if that's true.

49
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.680
Well I think part of it,

50
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.440
part of the reason many of us look bored at church

51
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.160
is because we have this picture of Jesus in our heads,

52
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.760
where we see Jesus as this little figurine on a shelf that we can take down when

53
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.760
we need him. But he's really not involved in our lives much else than that.

54
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.580
And we see him as somebody we can control in essence,

55
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.220
Rather than who he actually is. But, but think about that. How?

56
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.380
How wrong is that?

57
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.860
How wrong is that perspective of Jesus? See,

58
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.740
my hope today is that through this passage in God's word that you and

59
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.940
I would see Jesus rightly,

60
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.700
that he is this enthroned king over all things.

61
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.500
Like for too long I sat in church and just saw,

62
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.420
I never saw Jesus like this.

63
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.173
I,

64
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.940
But that small vision of Jesus in my head for so long led me to make

65
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.220
life all about me,

66
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.980
led me to think that I was some kind of self-made man,

67
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.100
led me to fall into the trap of lust, to sleep,

68
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.140
walk through church and not care at all about worship in any way.

69
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.300
That's what that small vision of Jesus led for me.

70
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.980
But praise the Lord. He took the blinders off so I could see,

71
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.620
finally see him like this,

72
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.620
which meant I finally saw myself in light of who he is.

73
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.940
And that's what changed everything for me.

74
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.440
That's why this theological vision of Jesus is so critical for us.

75
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.200
That's why we need to see Jesus above all like this.

76
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.120
Like that's the whole theme of the series, right? Christ above all,

77
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.840
this is where it comes from.

78
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.120
So that we see nothing else as ultimate in him.

79
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.960
That's the goal that we see nothing else as ultimate.

80
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.200
My hope today is that each of us would walk away from this moment

81
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.423
transformed

82
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.000
where we would then boldly praise him in here. Yes,

83
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.120
but then we'd boldly live for him out there because of

84
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.800
who he is. And to get there,

85
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.360
I wanna show you from this passage, six essential truths about Jesus.

86
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.280
Six things that that would've distinguished Jesus from all the other gods in

87
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.360
colossi at that time. But about also things,

88
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.880
truths that you can base your life on as well,

89
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.440
that you can base today and forever on these things about who he

90
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.840
is. So God, we pray as, as we look at this,

91
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.840
I pray that you make us more like you through

92
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.760
this, that you s you show us who you are,

93
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.720
you show us more of the reality of of being

94
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.040
God and what that means. So thank you God for that.

95
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.880
Help us holy Spirit to see what you want us to see in Jesus' name.

96
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.440
Amen. So here's the first truth.

97
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.880
The first truth is that Jesus is the perfect image.

98
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.200
Jesus is the perfect image.

99
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.920
Verse 15 says that he is the image of the invisible God.

100
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.080
And verse 19 says, further in him, all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.

101
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.320
Now this word image is used all over scripture.

102
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.400
It's actually the word icon in the Greek language it was written in originally.

103
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.880
And that word icon's familiar to us, right? It's,

104
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.800
it's something to us that might mean a,

105
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.760
a picture or a symbol on a screen that you double click to get to an app or

106
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.480
something like that, right? It could even mean somebody that that is a,

107
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.680
a celebrity or somebody that's done some big things in their life.

108
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.880
They're known as an icon of whatever they are, right?

109
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.280
But here in Colossians one,

110
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.280
it means that which has the same form as something else.

111
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.720
That which has the same form as something else.

112
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.960
It's a living picture that corresponds to an original.

113
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.030
That's why we see back in Genesis 1 27,

114
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.070
remember that that that God created man in his own image,

115
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.590
in the image of God, he created him, male and female, he created them.

116
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.590
And what that means is that humans,

117
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.670
you and I were created to reflect God's character.

118
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.840
We were a living picture of the original that that his nature was supposed to

119
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.520
show up through us. It kinda like a mirror reflects your image to you.

120
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.960
That's sort of what the idea here is. God created humans to reflect him.

121
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.160
Well if you know the story back in Genesis one all the way into chapter three,

122
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.440
we made it that far where Adam and Eve had done that for a while,

123
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.240
but then they sinned.

124
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.200
And what that led to is that every son or daughter of their lineage,

125
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.920
including you and me, was then a tainted image,

126
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.040
a distorted image of what God intended humans to be.

127
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.440
And that was until Jesus, right, who, who was not of the seed of Adam,

128
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.680
where Jesus instead was miraculously conceived in Mary's womb by the Holy

129
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.000
Spirit.

130
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.880
That was what he said was coming and fulfilled in

131
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.800
Mary. That was going to happen.

132
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.240
Then he went on as that new seed,

133
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.600
new lineage that he lived a perfect image bearing life.

134
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.800
That's why Hebrews one, three calls Jesus the exact imprint of God's nature.

135
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.560
You remember those old uh uh,

136
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.640
you put a penny in there and a quarter and you crank the thing and it puts an

137
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.880
imprint of some tourist attraction that you're at, right? It's an imprint.

138
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.760
He is the exact imprint of God's nature.

139
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.960
He was the most fully human person who's ever lived.

140
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.800
But he's also the fullness of God. We saw in Colossians one.

141
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.720
Now how can that be true? This 100% God, 100% man,

142
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.280
how can that even be possible? It is hard to understand.

143
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.920
But here's how Philippians two says it. It says,

144
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.400
though he was in the form of God,

145
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.520
he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped or to held onto for

146
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.353
his advantage.

147
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.720
But he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant,

148
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.360
being born in the likeness or image of men.

149
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.840
And so Jesus as the perfect image,

150
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.480
means he makes the invisible God visible.

151
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.280
If we need to know what God's like, we just look at Jesus.

152
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.360
He makes the invisible God visible,

153
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.680
which meant for the Colossians in the midst of all these other gods that they

154
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.560
could trust what Jesus was saying was actually good and right and true

155
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.240
that his way was right. They didn't have to find any other way.

156
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.760
It's the same for us today. We, we can look at Jesus fully, God, fully man,

157
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.080
and we can say that is worth following.

158
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.520
He is the perfect image.

159
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.560
Here's the second truth about Christ. He is the principle creator.

160
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.880
He's the perfect image. He's also the principle creator.

161
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.320
Look again, Colossians one 15 and 16,

162
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.600
he's the image of the invisible God. We already saw that.

163
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.680
But he's the firstborn of all creation.

164
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.240
For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth,

165
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.160
visible and invisible. Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities,

166
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.440
all things were created through him and for him.

167
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.920
Now, you may have already seen it throughout the book of Colossians.

168
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.840
You're gonna see things like that through him, by him. For him, in him,

169
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.680
it just highlights this. Again, Christ, above all, he's the point of this thing.

170
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.040
This is so many times even in this verse.

171
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.440
But notice a couple interesting phrases here. He says,

172
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.280
firstborn of all creation. That's one of the interesting things here.

173
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.880
Now this phrase actually over history has been misunderstood by some to say that

174
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.640
Jesus was created like firstborn son, right?

175
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.800
Firstborn of all creation.

176
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.520
But that's a misunderstanding of the way families worked back in the first

177
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.120
century. See, when we take verse 15,

178
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.520
not just by itself but with verse 16,

179
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.840
what Paul was saying was not that Christ was created in some way,

180
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.720
he's actually saying that Christ held the primary position in the family.

181
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.920
Firstborn son was the leader of the future family, right?

182
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.720
And so he's held the the pri primary position in the

183
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.800
family. That's why I like the way the new living translates. Verse 15,

184
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.480
it says He existed before anything was created and he is

185
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.240
supreme over all creation.

186
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.440
And we know that's true. We can't take just 15 by itself.

187
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.960
We know that's true because 16 says by Jesus,

188
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.560
all things are created through him, all things were created.

189
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.120
Same thing John one. Three says, all things were made through him,

190
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.040
meaning the word Jesus and without him was not anything made that was

191
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.680
made. Now you might be sitting there thinking about something, okay,

192
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.760
what I thought God created everything. Yes,

193
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.400
because Jesus is God. Remember? Right? This is the reality,

194
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.640
the hard part of this, but it's also reality. But, but this is really cool.

195
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.240
Check this out in the Old Testament, Genesis one,

196
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.680
remember how God created, did he have all kinds of, you know,

197
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.600
tools and resources and stuff? No, he spoke. God said,

198
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.800
let there be light. God said,

199
00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.440
let there be plants like he created with this speech.

200
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.520
But then listen to this Psalm 33, 6 adds by the word

201
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.880
of the Lord. The heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth,

202
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.080
all their host. Now,

203
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.800
do you remember what John one calls Jesus

204
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.840
the word by the word of the Lord, even in Psalm 33,

205
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.000
even in Genesis one,

206
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.600
the word of the Lord was the agent of creation.

207
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.640
That is Jesus. That's the argument Paul's making here.

208
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.760
That Jesus is the principle creator that this God,

209
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.240
the Colossians were worshiping was all powerful.

210
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.200
They don't need to doubt that maybe there's gonna be a competition someday

211
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.760
between the gods that they're worshiping or choosing to worship.

212
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:16.160
That Jesus is the all powerful principle creator over

213
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:16.600
all things.

214
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.080
They didn't need to try and appease all these other gods for their security.

215
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.760
They have the secure one who created everything

216
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.240
but shouldn't that lead us to take heart too, even today,

217
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.640
maybe we don't have the same context as they did back in Colossae, but,

218
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.720
but we have a lot of other nations and

219
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.553
threats.

220
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.880
We have a lot of things that are seen, but also a lot of things that are unseen,

221
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.040
that are pressing on us, that are coming at us, that are worrisome,

222
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.160
that are risky,

223
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.280
that all these things are coming at us just as much we can take heart

224
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.120
because Jesus is over them all just as much today as he was 2000 years

225
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.960
ago. He is over them all. He's the principle creator.

226
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.640
So everything comes from him.

227
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.440
And so it should give us some confidence, but it should also remind us of this.

228
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.080
It should remind us that Jesus is Lord over not only our spiritual

229
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.560
lives, he's also Lord over our material lives.

230
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.680
Here's what I mean by that. You can't separate Sunday morning from Friday night

231
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:39.320
like he's not just Lord over of your spiritual growth on Sunday and you,

232
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.480
you give him his due, check the box and move on. No, he is Lord,

233
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.240
if he's the creator,

234
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.560
he's Lord over every little corner of your material life too.

235
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.960
He is principle creator.

236
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.560
We keep going. Truth number three about Jesus.

237
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.720
He is the preexisting sustainer.

238
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.880
He is the preexisting sustainer.

239
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.400
This is verse 17. Now look at this again.

240
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.920
And he is before all things and in him all things hold

241
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.960
together. And so here,

242
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.600
Jesus being before all things could mean either that he pre-existed

243
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.240
or that he ranks first above all things.

244
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.760
Yes again, right Paul, for Paul,

245
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.760
these things go together that they don't separate that Jesus

246
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.720
does have precedence in time that he did exist before everything.

247
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.360
But he also has precedence in rank that he's before all things He's in first

248
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.243
place.

249
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.280
It's what John one one says in the beginning was the word.

250
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.800
The word was with God and the word was God. It's just like Genesis one, one,

251
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.960
the same kind of language that Jesus has always been.

252
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.450
He's pre-existed and so he could create.

253
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.610
But here's in verse 17, there's a next phrase. It's really interesting.

254
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.130
He says in him, all things hold together.

255
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.210
That's why I use the word sustainer.

256
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.210
Because here Paul says it's Jesus who holds all of

257
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.190
creation together. Hebrews one, three says,

258
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.550
he upholds the universe by the word of his power,

259
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.060
right? This is what it says about Jesus. Now, yes,

260
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.940
while Jesus was here physically for 33 years on earth, he had to drink food,

261
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.740
drink drink food. He had some of you do I guess, right? We drink food.

262
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.700
Um, what was that stuff called? Ryan? I can't remember. Ent, that's what it was.

263
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.980
Uh, so he had to drink water. He had to eat food,

264
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.820
he had to take a nap even in a storm on a boat, right? And yet

265
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.870
Philippians two says he was in the form of God.

266
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.550
And so he had to temporarily set aside some of those things to identify with us.

267
00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.750
Take on flesh. But you can't distinguish him,

268
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.830
humanity, Jesus from God, Jesus. 'cause as God,

269
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.510
if he existed before anything else, that means he doesn't need anything.

270
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.390
We can do nothing and bring nothing to him that would provide anything for him.

271
00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.630
He doesn't need anything as God.

272
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.960
In fact, he's the one who sustains us.

273
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.980
People in Colossae would worship all of these other gods by bringing food to

274
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.740
a shrine or bringing food to a temple. You can see it in India right now.

275
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.820
You can see these things. They're worshiping by saying,

276
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.260
I gotta provide for this God. That's a pretty,

277
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.500
pretty feeble weak God if you have to feed 'em.

278
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.300
But listen to what

279
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:08.180
Paul writes in acts or what he says in Acts 17

280
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.340
to the Areopagus in Athens, he says,

281
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.060
the God who made the world and everything in it being Lord of heaven and earth

282
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.500
does not live in temples made by man.

283
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.500
Nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything

284
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.620
since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath

285
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.620
and everything. So whether you acknowledge it or not,

286
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.660
you woke up today because Jesus said, you're waking up today.

287
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.140
The earth is spinning through the galaxy today because Jesus says

288
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.960
it's rain and crops,

289
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.640
intelligence, athleticism.

290
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.520
It all comes from him.

291
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.970
You didn't come up with it yourself. It comes from him.

292
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.250
And so when we think that way about Jesus,

293
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.890
clearly that's not just a little buddy on your shoulder.

294
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.730
That's not a little figurine on the shelf that you can take down when you need

295
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.810
him and leave him up there when you don't think you need him. No,

296
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.970
Jesus is the preexisting sustainer of all of life.

297
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.420
Should that not spark in us

298
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:32.060
a little bit of fear that we ought to avoid trying to be the

299
00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.300
sustainer of our own lives,

300
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:39.020
that we think we can make this thing continue or we can stop or we can do

301
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.260
whatever to make our lives continue. We should.

302
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.980
We should be afraid of taking that away from who can actually handle that.

303
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.340
But it should also spark in us a a sense of gratitude

304
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:59.700
that everything we have, even our very breath, is from him.

305
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.540
Praise him for it. He's the preexisting sustainer.

306
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.260
Jesus is the preexisting sustainer.

307
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.180
Here's the fourth truth. Jesus is the peerless head.

308
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.700
He is the peerless head. This is verse 18.

309
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.260
Again, I'm reading through it just that we read earlier,

310
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.780
reading back through it. Jesus is the head of the body,

311
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.193
the church.

312
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.660
Now here's where you need to understand a little bit of the context of what Paul

313
00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.260
was writing in for those original hearers. In their Greek context,

314
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:44.460
when they heard the word body, they would've immediately thought of creation.

315
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:49.180
They thought of creation as a of body and maybe even Zeus was the head of it.

316
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.540
But they,

317
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.980
they kinda had that picture of creation as a body and and when Paul then adds

318
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.820
Christ as the head of the body,

319
00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:01.260
which back then the word head didn't just mean directs it like a brain does.

320
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.580
It meant source or origin.

321
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.660
So when Paul adds Jesus as the head of the body,

322
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.700
they would have thought just like the previous couple verses that Christ is the

323
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.540
creator. Yeah. That that would've matched in their head to say, of course,

324
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.660
yeah. That that fits with the previous verses.

325
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.820
Christ is creating and originating everything here. Yes.

326
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.300
But then he flips it on its head by adding that qualifier.

327
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.340
The church again, it wasn't just the creation,

328
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.540
Christ is the head of the body, the church.

329
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.100
So what was he doing here? Why did he take it out of the realm of creation,

330
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.660
put it into the church? Well, blah,

331
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.760
I believe he was playing off of this new creation idea that the church

332
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.640
is intended to be

333
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.840
That Christ being the head of the church means that Jesus hear this,

334
00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.280
he is originating a new humanity. The church

335
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.160
that we are to be,

336
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.800
the church is to be a redeemed society that looks completely

337
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.280
different than the rest of humanity.

338
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.330
Do we see the church like that?

339
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.990
Do you see this church as God does,

340
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.390
that it is intended to be a countercultural way of life,

341
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.510
that it is intended to be something different than the world?

342
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.190
Or is church merely an accessory for you?

343
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.790
Like if this is who Jesus is,

344
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.550
if this is who he's intended us to be,

345
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.670
if this is what he's intended us to be, then we cannot

346
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.630
just show up when it's convenient.

347
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.300
We must deeply commit to to relationships

348
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.740
that will be life-giving and transformative for us.

349
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.780
We must commit to serving one another like Christ commands.

350
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.420
We must commit to giving generously.

351
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.380
So the gospel goes forth and we provide for brothers and sisters.

352
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.140
We must commit to seeing this as a counter-cultural way of life.

353
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.100
Not just something we can do on Sundays when we, when we're home,

354
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.740
right? This is who it is.

355
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.900
If Jesus is the matchless head of the church,

356
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.260
then he's worth everything for it.

357
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.720
He's the peerless head. It's not just another club.

358
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.640
It's not just the same like any other group of people out there.

359
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.080
The church is intended to be a new creation.

360
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.450
Here's truth number five.

361
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.690
He is the preeminent resurrector,

362
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.090
the preeminent resurrector.

363
00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.670
I had just read part of verse 18. Here's the rest of it. He is the beginning,

364
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.350
the first born from the dead,

365
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.030
that in everything he might be preeminent.

366
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.790
There's a new phrase here that Jesus is the first born from the dead.

367
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.870
Now, I've already seen the word firstborn before that,

368
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.070
that he is ranking first right in in all things

369
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.870
here. He's ranking first in resurrection. So what does that even mean?

370
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.950
Like why does resurrection point to his preeminence?

371
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.950
Why does resurrection highlight that Jesus is the first place in everything?

372
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.190
Like how, how does that tie together?

373
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.370
Because

374
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.320
No one else has ever done it. No one else has ever done it.

375
00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:51.120
No other God died and then defeated death by coming back to

376
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.080
life to save people.

377
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.720
He's the first place in it that makes him the most important in this, right?

378
00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.720
He's the first born from the dead,

379
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:05.360
which makes him preeminent. 'cause again,

380
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.440
remember the Colossian Christians were being presented with a buffet of

381
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.280
religious options and there was all kinds of things that they were,

382
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:18.800
were sampling from potentially, or they were being tempted to pull from.

383
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.800
They were being tempted with this buffet. Like you go to cc's, right?

384
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.200
And there's all kinds of options.

385
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.680
You can stuff yourself with this and that and this and that.

386
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.560
They were seeing that in their own lives.

387
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.080
But the reality is that no other God had ever done this.

388
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.200
So when they're seeing this buffet,

389
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.200
this would save or that would save or that would fulfill or that would satisfy

390
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.840
or they're seeing. All these things come,

391
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.160
Paul's reminding them here that there's only one who's gonna do all those things

392
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.200
for them. Amen?

393
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.000
There's only one who's gonna satisfy one who's gonna fulfill only one who can

394
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.720
actually save. And his name is Jesus.

395
00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.760
He's the preeminent resurrector, the firstborn from the dead. By the way,

396
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.840
if Christ has not been raised, then we are all most to be pitied.

397
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.640
And we are hopeless in everything.

398
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.720
That's why this is so important that Christ did come back from the grave,

399
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.600
because that means we are able to be saved from our sin and have

400
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.880
an eternal hope someday. See,

401
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.840
because he has resurrected, we do have hope.

402
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.160
That means we have this reality of Jesus,

403
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.440
not just in the grave somewhere that we're venerating and honoring with icons

404
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.120
and things like that.

405
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.120
Nowhere worshiping a king who sits on the throne over all things,

406
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:42.040
which one day he's gonna come back as he promised. That's who we're worshiping.

407
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.560
He is the preeminent resurrector. And so listen,

408
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.160
we've got five truths that are really pretty amazing already.

409
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.300
We could stop there and be good enough.

410
00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.380
But what Paul did with the rest of this passage is he drilled down to make it

411
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.500
even more personal. See,

412
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.540
he said that Yahweh is not merely an uninvolved deity.

413
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.350
He's not just a God out there doing these things. He wants a relationship.

414
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.790
And that's the sixth truth is that Jesus is the

415
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.030
proclaimed reconciler.

416
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.070
He is the proclaimed reconciler.

417
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.270
Starting in verse 19, for in Jesus,

418
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.710
all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell and through Jesus,

419
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.750
to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven,

420
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.600
making peace by the blood of his cross.

421
00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.920
And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds,

422
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.200
he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to

423
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.440
present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him.

424
00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.360
If indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast,

425
00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.680
not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard,

426
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:08.040
which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,

427
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.560
Paul became a minister.

428
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.920
So he's beautifully explained the, the supremacy of Christ.

429
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.280
And here at the tail end,

430
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.560
he points it back to God's saving work through Christ to what that

431
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.480
means for you and me and them forever.

432
00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.080
'cause reality is that as God,

433
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:35.000
Jesus satisfied the requirements of God through his

434
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.440
death on the cross.

435
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.160
And what that does is it begins to bring all things out of order,

436
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.560
back into order someday all of creation. But here we see,

437
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:50.520
certainly that includes sinners like you and me who are

438
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.800
estranged, hostile, evil.

439
00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.880
He brings those things back into order. And listen, it's critical for us.

440
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.520
I know people don't like hearing the bad news.

441
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.160
We don't like talking about that reality.

442
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.800
The the reality is it's critical for us to understand the depth of our

443
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.240
sin against God because that's the only way we really

444
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:15.880
appreciate the good news of what Jesus has actually done.

445
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.560
Here's how I, I heard it illustrated one time like this.

446
00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.280
If you come and see me and, and you say to me, Hey,

447
00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.480
I was at your house the other day and,

448
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.040
and a bill came due and I went ahead and paid it for you,

449
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:38.280
I really wouldn't know how quite to respond. I,

450
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.080
I need to know something about how big that bill actually is.

451
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.070
Like,

452
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:49.010
was it a package that came and there was extra postage due and you you paid a

453
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:53.010
couple bucks and you got the package for me? Well, I,

454
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:57.690
I would say thank you, thank you very much.

455
00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.130
That was very kind of you.

456
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:06.810
But what if it's that thing I was afraid of getting from the

457
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.650
i r s saying that I owed hundreds of thousands of dollars of back taxes

458
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.163
and you paid that.

459
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.630
See until I know to say thank you

460
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.190
or to fall at your feet and kiss your feet

461
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.670
and say thank you, I don't know how to respond to you,

462
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.600
right? I I don't know how to respond.

463
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.680
I don't know how happy to be because I don't know how big the debt you paid

464
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.950
actually was. Listen, Christians,

465
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.510
we should be really, really happy

466
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.110
because we need to see this reality that Colossians one says,

467
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:59.230
you and I are alienated from God. We are hostile to God.

468
00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.110
We are evil in our deeds from birth, every single one of us.

469
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.810
And that's the reality that, that Jesus,

470
00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:12.370
the eternal son of God took on flesh and he lived a perfect life that you and I

471
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:16.450
should have lived. But then he died the death on the cross shed,

472
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.970
his forgiving blood to reconcile us.

473
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.090
That word means the opposite of alienated.

474
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.570
Alienated means kicked out far from God.

475
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.450
Reconcile is brought near as a friend.

476
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:35.490
Why did he do that? He did that because we deserved it.

477
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.820
No, he did that merely because he loves us. And listen,

478
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.100
as a parent, I would do anything to save one of my kids' lives.

479
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.780
I'd give a kidney, I'd give my heart, I would push 'em out of a moving the,

480
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.020
the way of a moving train. I would do all of that,

481
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.460
whatever it took to save their life.

482
00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.780
You multiply that by infinity and that's how much Jesus loves you.

483
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.750
And he doesn't just make us his friends and kind of like

484
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.270
look past the sin and sweep it under the rug a little bit. He,

485
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.103
he doesn't just do that.

486
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.630
Did you see He does all that He does in order to

487
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.790
present you wholly and blameless and above

488
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.630
reproach before him.

489
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.990
He is working that in you believer.

490
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.680
Do you believe that? Like do, do you see this for you?

491
00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:40.160
Do you believe that if you are in Christ by faith,

492
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.320
he is making you holy. That word means set apart, distinct, sanctify.

493
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.480
He's making you that way. He is making you blameless.

494
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.960
That word means unblemished.

495
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.040
It means it's like you lived Jesus' life.

496
00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.680
And then he says above reproach.

497
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:05.400
That word means no charge can be made against you in a court.

498
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.630
You're not guilty and hear me.

499
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.190
I know you might not feel like that's true of you today.

500
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.050
You might not feel that those things are true of you. And listen,

501
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.690
I'm right there with you. The enemy loves to dredge up my past,

502
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:28.480
to keep me ineffective for him. He does that to you.

503
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:33.480
He's maybe doing that right now to you in your brain. But hear me today, church,

504
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.520
Romans eight, one,

505
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:39.040
there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

506
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.680
If your faith is in at Jesus as Lord in Savior,

507
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.640
then all that he is covers all that you are,

508
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.180
all that you've done, all your past, all that he is, covers all of that.

509
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.980
And nothing can separate you from his love.

510
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.940
So stop letting your addiction, your past,

511
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.180
your situation, your self-talk.

512
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:17.180
Stop letting that stuff keep you from experiencing and walking in

513
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.500
his love for you.

514
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.820
Stop defining yourself by what other people say about you.

515
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.420
Stop defining yourself by what you even say to yourself.

516
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.530
Stop defining yourself by how productive you are

517
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.550
because the reality is that Jesus loves you infinitely no matter what.

518
00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:43.900
How

519
00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.830
Freeing is that,

520
00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.590
that you don't have to walk around trying to get it from anybody else?

521
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.830
You've already have it.

522
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:53.950
He makes me wanna worship

523
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.070
it makes me wanna sing his praises.

524
00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.990
It makes me wanna proclaim his excellencies to anybody who will listen in my

525
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.350
neighborhood or in the nations around the world.

526
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:09.910
It makes me want to live a life that pleases him in thought and action because

527
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.390
of what he has done for us.

528
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.950
I'm gonna love what Spurgeon said. He said,

529
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.590
I have a great need for Christ.

530
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.190
I have a great Christ for my need.

531
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:30.390
This is who he is. Church. I'm gonna invite our worship leaders to come out now,

532
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.230
but I want you to hear me. Church, listen,

533
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.710
because of who Jesus is,

534
00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.630
stay steadfast because of who he is.

535
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:50.030
Stay steadfast. Remember, he is sitting on that throne right now.

536
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.630
He's ruling over everything.

537
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:56.350
You don't have to wonder if things are out of control because he is in control

538
00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:01.270
and you need nothing else. He doesn't,

539
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.790
he you don't need anything else. He, he always gives what is good.

540
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.630
He always gives what is best. You might not understand. We might be confused,

541
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:12.950
but he always does it. And so that means church, that means Christian,

542
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.150
that means unbeliever. You can submit your life to him.

543
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.750
You can abandon control of your life to him.

544
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:28.310
You can prioritize time with him because you wanna get to know him.

545
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.870
You want to hear and feel and see and experience and taste and see that he's

546
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:37.160
good. And you know why?

547
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:45.110
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.

548
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:49.190
For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth,

549
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.870
visible and invisible.

550
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.710
Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.

551
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:59.310
All things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things.

552
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.350
And in him, all things hold together. And he is the head of the body,

553
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.110
the church. He is the beginning,

554
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.710
the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be preeminent for in

555
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.790
Him, all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell and through him,

556
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:18.150
to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven,

557
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.070
making peace by the blood of his cross.

558
00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.790
He is the radiance to the glory of God, the exact imprint of his nature.

559
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.870
And he upholds the universe by the word of his power.

560
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.990
After making purification for sins,

561
00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:36.190
he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high,

562
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:41.070
having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more

563
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.390
excellent than theirs. He is the alpha and he is the omega,

564
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:50.310
the first and the last. Therefore,

565
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.390
God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name

566
00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.510
that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus,

567
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.910
every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.

568
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:08.990
And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the

569
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:13.990
glory of God the Father Church. This is who Jesus is.

570
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:19.470
If this is who he is, why do we fix our eyes on anything else?

571
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:24.710
He is worthy of it. And so let's sing. Stand with me now.

572
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.630
Let's sing His glory to who he is and let's go live loud for

573
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.270
who he is as well. Church.
