1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.400
All right, if I could have your attention, please

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.200
we're going to go and get started. We've got pockets of people that are just

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.600
continuing to talk right here right here.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm just kidding.

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.000
Yeah, get on them who said get on them.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.500
So we are in week seven

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.200
and what you'll notice is in

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.300
the next few weeks now next week. We're not

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.500
going to be here because of fall break so next week

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
you get the week off, but then we'll get

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.900
started. We'll come back and we'll just have a five five sessions

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.200
left. But what

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400
you'll notice is as we get closer to the final

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.900
few weeks our instructions going to become more

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.300
and more specific to what will I actually

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.500
do at a micro group and we've been

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.900
studying processes and systems

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700
and Concepts and

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.300
precepts and now it's going

20
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.100
to turn a little bit more into the Practical and

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.300
so but that doesn't

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.700
mean we don't review and so we're gonna go ahead and review this is our this

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.400
apple making pathway. Everyone is

24
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.200
expected to come to worship. Let me see if I can get this

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.400
thing we'll started here.

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.100
Yes, I can everyone is expected to

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.600
come to worship but we don't believe it's enough just

28
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
to come to worship and sit together and and there's

29
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200
always going to be good music and always going to be good preaching but

30
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
but the requires an exchange of an idea

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.500
and so we we come into

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
relationship and our community groups and our

33
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
community groups are where relationships are built. They're open

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.400
groups. They're ongoing groups. They

35
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.200
don't have a start date and an end date

36
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.400
and so they're not like some of our equipping or training meetings,

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.700
but but they're

38
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.400
also some of them are large we had 50

39
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.300
in one of our community groups on Sunday, which is the biggest

40
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.800
group I've seen since I've been here but some of

41
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.600
them are large and and all of them except a

42
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.700
couple of ladies groups are

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.300
A co-ed groups men and

44
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.100
women in the same group. So what we're asking you to do is to get

45
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.400
involved in what we're calling a micro group and this is

46
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.600
The Sweet Spot. This is where we believe that

47
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.700
transformation is most likely to happen. And why

48
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.900
is that

49
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.800
Well, first of all, let's discuss I'm talk about transformation. What

50
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.700
is a disciple one who's following Jesus one

51
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.400
who's being changed by Jesus and one is

52
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.200
committed to the mission of Jesus and that's disciple making so

53
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.700
how many of you got that memorized.

54
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.300
Okay, looky here. We've got four or

55
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.300
five. You know, what I'm gonna do next. I'm gonna call on you.

56
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.400
Have you stand up? No, I didn't ask you for permission.

57
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.500
But I would love you would encourage me by coming

58
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
up to me and say Hey listen to this and then just telling me and I'll be

59
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.600
fired up. So we've talked about this that

60
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.500
the reason we are calling this our sweet

61
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.900
spot is that we believe that Jesus style

62
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.300
disciple making happens best in the

63
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.600
context of a relationship and very

64
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.200
little relationships are built in a large group

65
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.000
setting because you're sitting facing the same

66
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.700
direction listening to one person speak, but the

67
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.200
closer we get see Community groups, you can begin to see these

68
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.700
relationships form because you do have that give and

69
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.700
take opportunity for a conversation but in

70
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.700
the micro groups, this is what we're beginning to experience and

71
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.100
just last week because now I'm a little

72
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm a little more familiar to you one of our sweet disciple

73
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.600
making young ladies came.

74
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.400
Says, you know, we can't read a word that you're writing.

75
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.400
And I'm trying to decide who it was. I'm gonna

76
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.100
take my time. All right conversations. Oh crud

77
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.400
conversations con.

78
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.700
ver

79
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.200
say misspelled. I know you're gonna complain about that

80
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.800
too. All right, we'll have opportunities for conversation,

81
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.900
but we'll also have opportunities because of our conversations to

82
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.000
build relationships relationships.

83
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.000
It's starting to go bad on me again here and

84
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.100
we want to we want transparency

85
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.200
now, why is transparency important?

86
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.300
Cool looking good, doesn't

87
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.100
it? Alright guys, I started this speed up. You can understand

88
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.700
but transparency is important because we do

89
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.700
as westerners have a an incredible

90
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.300
propensity to share just pieces of

91
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.300
ourself that we want getting out. It's it's like

92
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.300
social media. We don't post the pictures of ourselves just

93
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.300
out of bed without makeup on ladies or with our bed

94
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.100
head men. We don't post those pictures. We wait

95
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.900
until we look good and then we'll take several. You

96
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.300
don't just post the first picture you take it

97
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.000
and what do you do?

98
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.400
You look at it.

99
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.900
Let me just ask you a question. This is transparency. All right, when you

100
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.500
take a group picture, who's the first person you

101
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.700
look at when you look at the group picture?

102
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.300
Yourself, of course, and you can

103
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.400
tell if it's a good picture or not based upon what?

104
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
If you look good doesn't matter what the rest of group looks

105
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.200
like, right? So transparency means

106
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.400
okay, there may be parts of me that need

107
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.100
to to have the scrutiny of scripture and

108
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.700
the accountability of people whom I

109
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.400
trust to to help me with these issues. So

110
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.200
transparency is important and eventually I'm gonna go slow here.

111
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.400
intimacy

112
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.500
All right intimacy means that you're going

113
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.200
to be able to share things with me that you might not be able to share with

114
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.700
anyone else that I'll be able to trust you with those things because I

115
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.200
know that you love and care for me the way I love and care

116
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.800
for you and that's intimacy. All right, so there's a a quick

117
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.400
review and now we're

118
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.900
gonna get started on page four of your handout how to

119
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.400
make a disciples and a very important piece

120
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.000
of how to make disciples starts from the

121
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.000
very beginning choose disciples wisely. Now

122
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.500
what's going to happen when this 12 week

123
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.400
series is over is that we're going to be very close to

124
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.300
the holidays and I would suggest that during the

125
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300
holidays you probably not start a group because the

126
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.400
holiday seasons crazy people are busy they're

127
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.300
going here and there but at the beginning of the first of

128
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300
the year, that's when people are most likely to

129
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.300
make a commitment towards something important. And so what I

130
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.500
would suggest for you is as you were beginning

131
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.400
to put together a plan to make

132
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.900
Disciples you choose disciples wisely. What does

133
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.500
that mean? It's a crucial question because you

134
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.000
are going to be investing your life in

135
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.700
another person. It's going to take time. It's

136
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.700
going to take energy. It's going to take just a

137
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.500
kind of an emptying of self. Whereas

138
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.300
you'd rather sit by yourself and do what you like. Now, you're

139
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.000
going to be planning to eat with or sit with somebody and and

140
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.300
Converse and go down that

141
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.600
relational Road of intimacy and vulnerability and

142
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.900
transparency and accountability. And so some of

143
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.100
you are still deciding. I don't know

144
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.900
if I can do this. I really don't know if I can do this.

145
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.600
And and frankly, you just don't

146
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.500
know if you have it in you but I want you to hear me say

147
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.200
that I believe that God is preparing you each one of

148
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.800
you each disciple maker right now that never

149
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.900
before perhaps. Have you been confronted as

150
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.500
Abruptly as you're being confronted now

151
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.800
to do something for the Lord

152
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.600
in the area of disciple making but

153
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.500
but here I want you to hear me say this too and this is just as important

154
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500
that God is also Preparing People to respond

155
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.400
to your invitation.

156
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.300
God has someone out there who needs an

157
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.400
intentional leader to come alongside them

158
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.700
and invite them to be a part of A discipleship

159
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.100
experience. So, how do I choose a person

160
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.300
to disciple? Well, the selection criteria is very important

161
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.600
and that's what we'll be talking about tonight is selection Criterion,

162
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.400
and I'm going to ask you not to look for the most. Holy person.

163
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.300
Okay.

164
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.800
If I find somebody really, holy then

165
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.100
my work here is done. Right? Well, I wasn't

166
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.700
your work now. Did you know that sometimes the

167
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.800
holiest people are not necessarily the

168
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.000
most receptive people?

169
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.200
They in their mind have already got it figured out and they

170
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.200
don't need to be transparent because frankly there's nothing to

171
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200
be transparent about.

172
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.700
Right, sometimes the greatest

173
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.600
disciples are new to the faith.

174
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.400
I tell you a story that happened in This Very Room

175
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.000
about two weeks ago. Maybe three weeks ago a brand

176
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.100
new believer had just come to the

177
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.400
Lord and it just moved to the area and was looking for

178
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.700
someone to help them with their new faith. And so I

179
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.100
get word that this is going to happen. It's hard for

180
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.200
me to respond while I'm up here somebody walks in the back, but they

181
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.000
walk back. They talk to my Administrative Assistant. Yes, somebody's

182
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.100
calling.

183
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.200
I don't know who it is, but you don't get to talk to me right

184
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.300
now.

185
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.000
All righty.

186
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.400
but they

187
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.300
they come and their question was is I

188
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.200
just need somebody to help me study the

189
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.500
Bible.

190
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.700
And very very simple question. And so it just so

191
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.300
happened that I had eaten lunch with a cup and I

192
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.500
knew that the female in this couple was a

193
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.500
disciple maker and would love to have a

194
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.800
young new fresh faith in her

195
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.200
group. And so I intentionally took her

196
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.500
over to that group and they had a great first night and then

197
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.200
after that night, I didn't

198
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.300
ask her to do this, but I kind of knew that it was gonna happen. She brought

199
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.700
her to me. She said I want

200
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.500
you to meet my new best friend and what

201
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.200
what happened to her is that she'd gone

202
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.700
from an intentional leader to someone who was vibrantly awake

203
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.400
that got it entrusted to her someone who

204
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.500
was new in the faith.

205
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.100
It's like a brand new parent and brand new

206
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.200
parents. My kids are grown and gone. I've got grandbabies now,

207
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.800
but I remember when my first little girl was born and

208
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.500
I remember being a total fool for

209
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.200
this little girl and I was hoping for a boy

210
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.100
and back then you didn't know before you got one but man when God gave me

211
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.100
a girl it was like I've never been so

212
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.400
in love right? Well, that's

213
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.300
what happens to us when we're giving an opportunity when

214
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.600
God entrusts someone to us who is new in

215
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.300
the face and let me see if it's

216
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.300
got this got this right somebody who's new to the face and you're

217
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.200
thinking Lord. I am so honored that you would bring

218
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.300
them this direction. So you're you're deciding who to pick

219
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.200
you're not looking for the holiest person. You might

220
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.300
be looking for someone who's new to the faith. And what I

221
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.500
would like for you to do is do what Jesus did and this is how he chose

222
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.300
the 12. Okay. They were

223
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.200
not the best and brightest.

224
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.100
The disciples were not the best and brightest.

225
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.200
The best and brightest had already been snatched up

226
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.300
by other rabbis.

227
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.100
Okay, it's the truth when they you find a young man and you

228
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.500
believe he's got great potential for leadership and

229
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.200
especially for Learning and so they would

230
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.100
snatch them up and they would follow their Rabbi and the

231
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.200
fact that these men were working and they were doing what their

232
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.400
father had done and they're part of the family business now means that

233
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.400
they hadn't been picked. They've been overlooked and

234
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.100
discarded by the religious leaders at this point. They were

235
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.700
just common men. And so we're

236
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.500
gonna look at the jesus' example, we're gonna learn what Jesus did

237
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.400
in Luke 6:12 and 13. It

238
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.800
says in these days. He Jesus went

239
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.900
out to the mountain to pray.

240
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.600
All night he continued in prayer to God. Now.

241
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.400
This was not uncommon for Jesus Jesus set

242
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.400
the examples for us as far as how to pray

243
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.400
and and when to pray and why to pray

244
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.000
and then we get a hint as to what he was praying about.

245
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.100
And when they came what did he

246
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.800
do? He called his disciples and shows

247
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.500
from them 12 whom he

248
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.700
named Apostles. So the Bible doesn't explicitly

249
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.500
say this but it does imply that the reason Jesus

250
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.200
was praying is that he was about to go pick the

251
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.200
disciples and and that's exactly what he did. So

252
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.200
the first thing you do when choosing a

253
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.300
disciple is pray.

254
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.600
You ask God to show you those who are hungry

255
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.600
for more of him. If if

256
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.500
you don't hear me say anything else this I

257
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.100
believe is the number one Criterion.

258
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.400
Okay in your community group, do you know someone who?

259
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.500
Who seems to be seeking to know more of

260
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.900
him now? You can be a brand new believer.

261
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.600
And not be seeking to know more of him.

262
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.100
and you can be

263
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.800
you can be a superstar. I used to say an Awana

264
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.700
Award winner and then somebody from Moana really I

265
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.200
was offended so I don't say that anymore.

266
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.400
but a super Christian and still

267
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.600
not seeking and to know more of him, but you're seeking

268
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.400
to know hungry for someone the Bible

269
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.100
describes it as spiritual thirst or spiritual hunger, but

270
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.300
they're hungry for more of him

271
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.800
and number two. They're willing to clear space in

272
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.700
their schedule now.

273
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.800
I know your life.

274
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.000
I know that there was a day when

275
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.600
you were shocked how quickly

276
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.500
the microwave would heat up your food.

277
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.300
But I know now you're you're tapping on the on the window like

278
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.400
come on. Come on. Come on.

279
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.100
Right. It's a microwave. It's it's remarkable technology,

280
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.200
but it's just not fast enough, right?

281
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.500
So I also know I'm from

282
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.900
North Dallas and if you didn't know this Dallas traffic is legendary

283
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.800
for making people insane. And so

284
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.700
Edmond is done about a

285
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.200
hundred thousand people which is a lot.

286
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:16.800
hmm

287
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.500
I think it's enough to have a left turn lane. That's my opinion.

288
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.700
All right, and or an

289
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.300
on-ramp or something, but since we don't have those, let's

290
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.700
just be honest because we believe in transparency and

291
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.300
vulnerability. How many of you today complained about

292
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.800
traffic at least one time? Okay. Look see we're busy

293
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.500
that five seconds is gonna

294
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.600
cost me right but but we're

295
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.200
looking for someone who's willing to say, I want more of

296
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.600
him and I'm willing to enter into a relationship with you because together

297
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.400
you and I are going to be able to discover more of

298
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.900
him and I'm gonna do whatever that takes. Okay. And so

299
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.100
you're also looking for those who are Faithfully apply

300
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.600
what they're learning to their lives. So

301
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.300
there's a spiritual sensitivity. This is the first and

302
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.500
most important criteria and why because a disciple

303
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.700
is someone who is following Jesus and being changed

304
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.300
by Jesus. So they're gonna be need to be open to

305
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.500
transformation. So I'm gonna ask you

306
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.900
to do this. I'm gonna ask you to ask

307
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.200
To give you one person you say I thought it was a micro

308
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.100
group. Yes, it is, but I don't want you to

309
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.400
Start when you finally have four. All right,

310
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.100
just ask God for one person.

311
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.900
And when God gives you that person you to start

312
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.300
meeting together and You Begin pouring your life into

313
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.300
that person and you begin to sense what God is up

314
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:40.300
to?

315
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.000
And and you know what they're going to do. They're gonna say, you know,

316
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.100
I got a friend who would really really get

317
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.200
something out of this. Do you think you think you

318
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.600
might and if it's a brand new group you could say absolutely bring them

319
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.300
and you can start a new relationship that way and so

320
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.400
what's happening is immediately he's kind

321
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.300
of catching or she's kind of catching. The the

322
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.200
spirit of this is me committing to the mission of

323
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.200
Jesus disciple making so I bring my friend and

324
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.500
then he and I grow and Faith together and then maybe we'll

325
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.200
start a micro group outside of this one. So that's

326
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.400
what that's what you're doing is you're just asking for

327
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.400
one person. And when that when that when

328
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.000
God gives you that one person you get started.

329
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.300
And don't worry about the

330
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.300
number of people you disciple. I would love for you to have a micro

331
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.500
group a micro group can be two or three or

332
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.000
four. It just can't be five six seven eight or nine.

333
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.200
Okay, we'll talk about that in a minute. So you just instead

334
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.800
of concerning yourself about numbers instead

335
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.700
of concerning yourself about. What are you going to tell the

336
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.300
people that the

337
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.600
at this

338
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.100
at the community group or what? Are you going to see when you

339
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.200
see me? What are you gonna say? Don't worry about any of that worry about

340
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.400
your own faithfulness with those who God is entrusted

341
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.400
to you. Maybe your first your first time

342
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.200
maybe God interests to you one.

343
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.100
And remember our thing just to the right of the

344
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.100
micro group is the one-on-one experience. That's good too. Right? So

345
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.400
number two, you're going to you're going to pray for someone

346
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.500
who has is looking for Jesus more of

347
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:16.600
him.

348
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.600
Someone who has a spiritual interests. That

349
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.100
means that the spirit of God has already

350
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.500
at work in this person's life and they have a hunger for

351
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.400
Spiritual things. They may not know much but as

352
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.600
long as they're hungry to know more and they're going

353
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.300
for more of God's truth and they're quick

354
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.500
to respond. So start praying and start looking

355
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.200
around you.

356
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.200
um, it doesn't have to be somebody in your CG,

357
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.500
but it can be

358
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.800
In in our room, there's a young couple who when

359
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.800
covid came they decided to start doing discipling in

360
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.400
their neighborhood.

361
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.000
And he meets with the Earth some

362
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.700
of the men early before they go to work and she

363
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.500
meets with their wives in the afternoon when

364
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.500
all the kids are asleep.

365
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.400
And two weeks ago a couple

366
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.600
that they were discipling in their neighborhood started coming

367
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.600
to disciple making 101. So

368
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.400
you see the process of not just spiritual young adult

369
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.000
now being others centered, but

370
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.900
now these are not just disciple makers but they're bringing disciples whom

371
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.300
they have made that will one day be disciple makers

372
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.300
of themself what I told one of them was like Hey

373
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.600
That's grandparenting baby. I am proud of you and you

374
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.000
know, very young couple and they look at me like what what did you

375
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.000
say, but I think they know what I meant. So anyway, so number

376
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.500
three and this is a very unfortunate acronym.

377
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.600
Okay find somebody faithful

378
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.600
available and teachable. All right.

379
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.500
I told my wife we're looking for fat people.

380
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.100
And but it's faithful available and teachable.

381
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.400
So let's look at second Timothy 2:2.

382
00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.100
This is Paul.

383
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.600
To his disciple Timothy his young Protege whom

384
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.200
he's pouring his life into and what

385
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.100
you have learned from me in the

386
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.100
presence of many witnesses entrust of

387
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:12.600
Faithful Men.

388
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.000
Who will also be able to teach others also,

389
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.900
so you're looking for someone who's faithful available

390
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.100
and teachable to choose faithful people hungry

391
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.300
for more of him with an interest in spiritual things.

392
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.400
People who are also available who will create time

393
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.600
in their busy schedule to meet.

394
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.300
None of us has time to do this.

395
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.200
Okay. Listen to me. None of us has time to

396
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.500
do this.

397
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.500
That means we just have to make time for what's important.

398
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.200
I don't know what that means for you. There may be something you have to stop doing.

399
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.400
It won't be many weeks from now. You'll hear me saying

400
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.400
if if you eat a lunch or breakfast and you

401
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.200
have time because you can meet somebody for lunch or breakfast

402
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.900
right? But so they're

403
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.100
gonna be available choose those who are teachable. You

404
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.400
don't believe they don't believe they've got everything figured out.

405
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.000
There's spiritually an actual intellectually curious to

406
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.900
learn and to change. So remember that

407
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.200
acronym now, we're gonna finish up with

408
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.800
this fight the temptation to repeat old patterns.

409
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.400
Now what that means is

410
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.400
this and and and I'm gonna run the risk of

411
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.200
making some of you angry right now

412
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.100
and I don't want to but I just have to tell you what the truth

413
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.200
is. Okay old patterns.

414
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.900
Are so ingrained and entrenched in us that

415
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.500
it is hard for us to see a new

416
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.700
model. All right, even when disciple making

417
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.200
is articulated as plainly as

418
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.100
you as I can you see it through the VIN the

419
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.300
lens or the grid of

420
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.700
the way things have always been and and

421
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.300
we love that. We we love

422
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.300
hearing a good Vision casting and we're

423
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.300
used to hearing speakers talk about the way the church

424
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.600
can become more but but we

425
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.300
still we see this new vision through old lenses. And

426
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.400
so basically what

427
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.600
we do is we talk about this new vision, and we

428
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.100
don't follow it up with any action.

429
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.600
and even less accountability

430
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.000
so old patterns can allow

431
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.000
committed Christians to struggle to

432
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.100
accept personal responsibility for

433
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.900
disciple meeting and making

434
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.000
And it's just simply never been a part of

435
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.200
their old pattern so they can't imagine doing something. They've never done before.

436
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.100
Okay many things that we

437
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.300
do at the church don't lead to changed lives doesn't mean

438
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:47.700
they're wrong. Okay, my very

439
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.200
first huge responsibility at this church

440
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.600
was a gourmet hot dog contest.

441
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.300
You and I had a great time and a bunch

442
00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.000
of men responded and it was a lovely night, but I

443
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.800
frankly I don't know if anybody's live was changed that night. All

444
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.500
right, we had fun and it wasn't anything wrong with it, but

445
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.800
But we can do better than gourmet

446
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.700
hot dogs. All right, so and

447
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.200
I see my my pastor in the

448
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.100
back right here preaching plays an important part and

449
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.000
a huge role in community and communicating

450
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.500
the truth of God, but he's honest enough

451
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.100
to say but it's frustrating when people get up and walk out

452
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.900
of here unchanged and it happens every Sunday. Sometimes now some

453
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.400
are changed but most move on. Okay big

454
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.100
meetings and programs can be

455
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.800
encouraged and and inspiring but people will always

456
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.900
need a place to slow down and focus

457
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.500
on the deeper things in life and then be confronted

458
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.500
by someone who loves and trusts them to go further. That's

459
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.500
exactly why Jesus did what he did with his

460
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.800
disciples. So let's let's point

461
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.800
out a few things that old patterns look like we're

462
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.200
westerners old patterns usually look like

463
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.000
up into the right.

464
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.200
Okay. I've I've done this with some

465
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.600
of you guys.

466
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.300
They'll say man that we

467
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:09.600
started.

468
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.500
Seven weeks ago and he said man when that great.

469
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.700
And that and I said, yeah it was I said, we had 27 people.

470
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.400
Why I say that.

471
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.300
That's not success.

472
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.400
You know and it's because every time I've

473
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.400
ever had a conversation about church success, it's always been

474
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.600
evaluated by numbers.

475
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.300
Right, and that's what we used to say my last Church up into

476
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.700
the right as long as it's up into the right.

477
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.300
You know, that's that's an old pattern and

478
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.600
I'm saying you can't have more than five or

479
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.700
six in your group.

480
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.300
Because it's not a micro group anymore. And you start losing people

481
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.400
to The Fringe. It's like you want me to do this with just a few. No, Jesus

482
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.900
wants you to do this was just a few.

483
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.400
Right, it's not without what I want. So big meetings

484
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.700
are important, but they don't always result

485
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.200
in the kind of spiritual maturity. We

486
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.100
don't evaluate spiritual maturity by attendance or

487
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.600
even by retention of biblical knowledge.

488
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.100
Those are good things.

489
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.800
But transformation is the only real metrics for

490
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.500
discipleship old pattern

491
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.600
Church discipleship strategies revolve around Bible

492
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.500
study classes, and that's a good thing, but we're

493
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.300
not we're not going to be doing just Bible study.

494
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.400
We're going to be doing personal evaluation and

495
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.900
assessment and accountability together.

496
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.500
How many of your old enough to remember when Sunday night was called?

497
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.200
Church training

498
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.100
All right. Yeah, and we used to also

499
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.400
call it a church discipleship nine.

500
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.300
And it was basically just a time when we met together for

501
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.300
more Bible study. And again, I'm not against the Bible studies. I'm

502
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.400
not against anything that our church does necessarily. I'm just

503
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.200
saying that we can do this more intentionally.

504
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.200
And we can focus on transformation with people that

505
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.500
we love and trust and invest and poor lives

506
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.900
into and when we begin to see transformation, it

507
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.900
literally changes your world.

508
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.000
It rocks your world. So I

509
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.100
want to show you something that happened just

510
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.000
in the last four months, so I've been here four months.

511
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.700
And I told you the story about how it got started. This

512
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.600
is Keith, Skittle.

513
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.100
He's the first guy at my last church that said. Hey, I got questions.

514
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.000
He was raised in the east coast. He was a Catholic.

515
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.200
And so I let him buy

516
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.600
me some barbecue, by the way. I'll let you buy me barbecue, too. But anyway, I let

517
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.200
him buy me some barbecue and I said Keith.

518
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.700
What you need is to be discipled and he looks at me like oh

519
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.100
and so we met the very next week. And

520
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.600
before that

521
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.300
next week started this guy right here.

522
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.500
Where is he?

523
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.100
Is his rusty rusty comes to

524
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.900
me by way of a very unimp an

525
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.700
impersonal email from my pastor. It was

526
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.400
like John said, hey, I'm copying my friend the

527
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.500
disciple maker because it sounds like you need to be discipled. That's how that's

528
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.000
how good. I knew Rusty. So he and I were the first

529
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.400
ones to meet in the IHOP.

530
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.700
And I laid this Vision out to them and we begin to meet there's my

531
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.100
mom. Yeah, I'll pray for her. Okay. All right.

532
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.500
So we prayed for so we started me and

533
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.300
I said if we're still meeting together in two years. I've not

534
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:30.900
done my job.

535
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.200
That I would like for you guys to eventually lead your own

536
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.500
group.

537
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.900
And so this is July 14th. Okay.

538
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.300
I've been at Henderson Hills

539
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.700
now for a month and two weeks and they sent

540
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.900
this to me just to let them know. We're still going we're

541
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.500
still going.

542
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.100
And and then this morning I get this

543
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.900
one. This is October 5th.

544
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.300
And this is Rusty and this

545
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.200
is Rusty's new group.

546
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.100
And I know this guy and I know this guy and I know

547
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.400
this guy and I know this guy.

548
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600
I don't know this guy.

549
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.200
Never met him.

550
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.100
You see how this works.

551
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.500
You see how this works.

552
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.300
I didn't have to be there to say hey, this is a guy who might could use

553
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.500
a disciple now they're looking for themselves.

554
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.300
Now they're investing their lives and finally guys says, what

555
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.000
are you guys doing over here?

556
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.800
We'll come here and sit down with us and you can figure it out.

557
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.300
you know, and so

558
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.600
When I got this.

559
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.000
Who makes me emotional?

560
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.400
When I got this.

561
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.100
Picture this morning. I texted him this afternoon.

562
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.900
And I said would it be okay if

563
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.700
If I showed this picture tonight, and he

564
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.100
said absolutely then he sends me another

565
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:53.500
picture. He says we're all at the Raiders game. Anyway, so

566
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.600
the whole group went to the Rangers game this afternoon. So anyway, I

567
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.100
didn't get to go. But anyway,

568
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.600
So I just I'm trying to help you

569
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.800
understand that your micro

570
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.500
group is going to be a different experience than

571
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.300
anything you've ever done. I'm gonna ask you

572
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.000
to intentionally not fall back into Old patterns.

573
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.300
If you do then it's

574
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.600
always gonna be like, it's always been but

575
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.200
what we're wanting is what I believe Jesus style

576
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.600
disciple making promises and that

577
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.700
is is that there's going to be a higher interest

578
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.500
and spiritual things. There's going to be groups that

579
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.900
are hungry for more of Jesus and then because

580
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.200
there is an intentional leader. There's gonna be in people

581
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.600
included in ways that it's literally going

582
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.600
to change your life personally and

583
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.400
our church corporately.
