WEBVTT

1
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.605
Well, good morning again, church, uh, if you are new,

2
00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:24.485
my name's John, one of the pastors here.

3
00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:25.885
I would love to get to meet you.

4
00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:27.565
We're grateful that you would be here.

5
00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:29.645
Uh, if you have been here for many, many years,

6
00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.045
we're also grateful that you're here.

7
00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:33.565
So we love being together like this.

8
00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:34.845
Uh, and what a Sunday it is.

9
00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:38.445
As our kids and students move up a grade, they go

10
00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:41.925
to the next stage of life in that they gear up for school.

11
00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:44.365
Uh, I realize that some of you kids are in here

12
00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:46.845
for the first time, and so I'm excited for that.

13
00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:49.245
If you're a kindergartner, uh, we're thankful.

14
00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:52.245
I know you can hang with me. I know we can focus in on that.

15
00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:54.045
I, I, we talk about it up in kids all the time.

16
00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.125
I, we, we expect that. We know we can.

17
00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:58.885
Uh, and it's also partly

18
00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:01.005
because we're gonna start a new sermon series today.

19
00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:04.525
We're gonna start a new series in the Bible of preaching it

20
00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:06.685
and seeing what God says to us.

21
00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:08.125
And so that's

22
00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.685
what we're kicking off today called He Shall Reign.

23
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:12.925
Uh, one of our elders made a dad joke.

24
00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:15.205
Maybe we should have called it. It Shall Reign.

25
00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:19.325
Uh, maybe that's what we saw today. No, he shall reign.

26
00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:22.685
Uh, so I think we can look at First Samuel is

27
00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:25.605
where we're gonna be as we look towards this series.

28
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:27.845
First Samuel, go ahead

29
00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:29.605
and take your copy, God's word, turn there with me

30
00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:33.365
in the Old Testament, not too far into the Bible.

31
00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:36.965
You can find it amongst the history books there right

32
00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.885
after Judges and Ruth Book of one Samuel.

33
00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:41.245
You might put a bookmark there.

34
00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:42.485
We'll be in there for a long time.

35
00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:44.645
So just know that we're coming back to that over

36
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:46.765
and over again over the next few months.

37
00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:49.045
It does mean we're heading back into the Old Testament,

38
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:51.725
back into narrative, which I'm super excited about studying

39
00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:55.205
for myself, but also that we as a church get

40
00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:56.245
to study this together.

41
00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:00.245
But the question I've been asked already, why First Samuel,

42
00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:02.365
why did we not pick any of the other ones?

43
00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:03.685
Why this one? Well, first,

44
00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:07.245
because David, the main character of First Samuel is one

45
00:02:07.245 --> 00:02:08.445
of my favorite characters in the Bible.

46
00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:12.485
So I just love his story and studying that, but also

47
00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.605
because one of the most common titles given

48
00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:18.325
to Jesus in the New Testament is Son of David.

49
00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.605
So we need to understand what that even means.

50
00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:24.325
Where's that coming from? Why is that so important?

51
00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:26.965
We'll see that a lot here in one Samuel.

52
00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.935
But before we get to one Samuel, we need to

53
00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:33.335
answer some fundamental questions.

54
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.815
There's some foundational groundwork we need to lay

55
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.895
before we even study this book in itself.

56
00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:41.695
So we're gonna start there.

57
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:47.055
Fundamental questions, things that relate to First Samuel,

58
00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:49.935
but are generalized to more than just one Samuel.

59
00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:51.615
So the first question is, what do we do

60
00:02:51.615 --> 00:02:53.095
with narratives in the Bible?

61
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:55.775
What do we even do with narratives?

62
00:02:56.845 --> 00:03:00.205
They're all over these stories that we see in the Bible.

63
00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:02.165
What do we do with them? Well,

64
00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:03.965
what are our options, first of all?

65
00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:08.125
Well, we have seen some people consider them as kind

66
00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:12.165
of like this mishmash of biographical sketches

67
00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:13.405
and miracle stories

68
00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:15.765
and just kind of tossed them together like a salad.

69
00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:17.805
And that's what we have is the Old Testament.

70
00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:20.245
Like, well, that's, that's not really the

71
00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:21.285
right way to think about it.

72
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:26.065
In reality, what the Old Testament narratives do is they

73
00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:30.105
give us a theological history of

74
00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:32.065
how God related to his covenant people.

75
00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:35.585
They, they talk about God's relationship

76
00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:37.065
with his covenant people.

77
00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:39.745
They are absolutely historical events,

78
00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:41.185
but they're more than that.

79
00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:45.035
They're more than just a, a social studies book

80
00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:47.755
or a history textbook where it's factual information.

81
00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:51.795
These were written down in the way God inspired them

82
00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:56.675
to be written down for a theological purpose so

83
00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:58.795
that we understand more about God

84
00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.395
and we then know more about ourselves.

85
00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:03.755
So when we look at these, we can't just think

86
00:04:03.755 --> 00:04:06.875
that there's some kind of like lively engaging script

87
00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.995
for a movie that you can see on Netflix, right?

88
00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:11.635
We're not talking about any of that stuff.

89
00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:15.275
They are good movies at times, but they're more than that.

90
00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:18.315
They're intended to teach us about God,

91
00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:22.715
and then again, in relation to that about ourselves,

92
00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:26.635
so we can follow him more completely.

93
00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:29.195
We can know him more fully, all of those things.

94
00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:30.995
So we, we see narratives.

95
00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:33.115
We don't just think they're cool stories.

96
00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:37.795
They have a purpose. There's a second question

97
00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:38.875
related to that though.

98
00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:40.915
What do we then do with the characters?

99
00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:45.025
What those characters in the plot lines

100
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:46.625
of those narratives, what do we do with them?

101
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:49.935
Again, what are our options?

102
00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:55.175
Well, there is a trend out there

103
00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:59.455
to take a character in a story and moralize them.

104
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.375
What that means is you take what that person did

105
00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:06.135
or didn't do and say, well, we should do

106
00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:08.375
or not do what they did or didn't do.

107
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:12.295
Right? And it's just strictly moralism based on

108
00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:15.255
what they see or what they didn't.

109
00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:18.365
Lemme just give you an example. Maybe you've heard this one.

110
00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:20.885
Dare to be a Daniel, right?

111
00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:23.325
You ever heard that one before as a kid growing up

112
00:05:23.325 --> 00:05:24.605
and it's like, this is what you need to be.

113
00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:27.525
You'd be like, Daniel. Well,

114
00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:29.765
it's not always wrong.

115
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.125
I mean, we can emulate, but,

116
00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:35.365
but it's not usually the primary point of the passage.

117
00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:38.085
You understand that, right? It's not usually

118
00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:39.925
what you should be focused on first,

119
00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:42.125
it can be an application, but it's not first

120
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:45.525
and foremost the point of the narrative,

121
00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:46.845
a point of that character.

122
00:05:48.785 --> 00:05:52.085
And as I say that, just as a side note, if we're gonna dare

123
00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.165
to be a Daniel, we better be prepared to do all

124
00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:56.125
that Daniel actually did, right?

125
00:05:56.345 --> 00:05:58.405
Not just the cool parts and the courageous parts,

126
00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.405
but like everything all about his life and ministry.

127
00:06:04.235 --> 00:06:06.535
So the characters, yes, they are important.

128
00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:08.855
And often they're presented as positive

129
00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:11.615
and negative models for us.

130
00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:14.895
In fact, they're often contrasted, like we'll see with Saul

131
00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:18.415
and David that there's positive things in the contrast

132
00:06:18.415 --> 00:06:19.895
and negative things in the contrast.

133
00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:21.375
So we see how they work together

134
00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.015
to show us something about humanity.

135
00:06:24.555 --> 00:06:27.055
But again, ultimately these are avenues

136
00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:29.095
to show us more about who God is

137
00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:31.775
and how he works through humanity.

138
00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:35.205
What it teaches us about God first.

139
00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:36.405
In fact, we can't forget

140
00:06:36.405 --> 00:06:40.125
that God himself is actually a character in the narrative.

141
00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:42.725
We're not just reading these stories

142
00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:44.125
and seeing this person, that person,

143
00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:46.525
God is not passive absent.

144
00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:48.765
He's a major player in the narratives.

145
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.605
He speaks in dialogue with people.

146
00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.165
He works within human related problems.

147
00:06:55.305 --> 00:06:57.845
He delivers his people directly, not just

148
00:06:57.845 --> 00:06:59.565
with an army he delivers.

149
00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:04.545
So we can't miss him in the narrative

150
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.305
as we're reading the story,

151
00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:10.745
we're seeing God is playing a major part here,

152
00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:15.705
and that's what we want to know more about him

153
00:07:15.765 --> 00:07:18.025
so we can love him more faithfully.

154
00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:20.025
So that's two questions. There's a third one though.

155
00:07:21.085 --> 00:07:22.745
And this one's maybe not as obvious,

156
00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:27.425
but it's still as if not more important to the others.

157
00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:31.185
As we're reading the Old Testament historical narratives,

158
00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.025
the question is, what do we do with Jesus?

159
00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:37.215
What do we do with Jesus?

160
00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:41.665
In the Old Testament history, I know

161
00:07:41.665 --> 00:07:43.425
that sounds provocative a little bit,

162
00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:45.105
but just track with me here.

163
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:49.705
God, the Father, son, spirit triune God,

164
00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:51.585
one God existed from

165
00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:54.825
before time began, will exist forever and ever.

166
00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:59.645
Eternity future never began, never ends.

167
00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:06.525
But what we see, God, the Son taking on flesh happened

168
00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:08.205
around the year zero, right?

169
00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.775
So Jesus, per se,

170
00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:15.575
we don't see show up till zero.

171
00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:19.895
The problem here is the events in one Samuel take place

172
00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:21.775
about a thousand years before that.

173
00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:26.655
So yes, God always involved,

174
00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:30.895
but Jesus the savior, redeemer, he didn't,

175
00:08:30.895 --> 00:08:32.935
we didn't know till a thousand years later.

176
00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:34.135
So what do we do?

177
00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:37.415
How do, how do we read one Samuel

178
00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:40.615
with Jesus still coming a thousand years later,

179
00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:45.415
they were pre-Jesus, pre Messiah.

180
00:08:45.415 --> 00:08:47.615
Because in the Gospels, think about it, in the gospels,

181
00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:50.575
Jesus walking around, he's healing people teaching in the

182
00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:52.935
acts and follows those letters.

183
00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:55.290
In the New Testament, they're responding to Jesus.

184
00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:56.725
So that's a little different.

185
00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:59.045
But in first Samuel, the pre Messiah,

186
00:08:59.675 --> 00:09:00.885
they were still looking forward.

187
00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:05.605
We look back at it. So how do we read it?

188
00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:12.155
Well, Jesus said something interesting in Luke 24, uh,

189
00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:14.835
this is after his resurrection.

190
00:09:16.065 --> 00:09:18.715
He's walking on the road to Emmaus with a couple

191
00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:20.195
of his disciples and,

192
00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:23.595
and listen to what Jesus, uh, he, he's referred to

193
00:09:23.595 --> 00:09:24.995
as Luke's recording this about

194
00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:28.915
what Jesus did in Luke 24, 27 says, beginning with Moses

195
00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:32.275
and all the prophets, now Moses would be classified

196
00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:34.635
as the first five books of the Old Testament.

197
00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:36.795
And the prophets would be what continued

198
00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:40.315
after that, speaking God's word, beginning with them,

199
00:09:40.895 --> 00:09:43.595
he interpreted to them, to the disciples

200
00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:48.075
in all the scriptures, the things concerning himself.

201
00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:53.455
All the scriptures was the Old Testament to us.

202
00:09:53.455 --> 00:09:57.255
That's all they had. So he began with the first part

203
00:09:57.255 --> 00:09:59.775
and then interpreted through all of it, showing them,

204
00:09:59.835 --> 00:10:01.055
Hey, this was about me.

205
00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:03.495
This is about me. This is about me.

206
00:10:03.525 --> 00:10:05.215
This is showing you who I'm gonna be.

207
00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:06.335
This is showing you who I am.

208
00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:09.735
That's what He's doing in Luke 24 27.

209
00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:12.595
So here's what that means for us.

210
00:10:14.215 --> 00:10:16.605
We're post even that we're further down the road.

211
00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:20.245
And so we need to look back through the lens

212
00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:21.765
of Christ into one Samuel.

213
00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:26.515
We need to read one Samuel through the lens of the Messiah,

214
00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:28.475
through the lens of Jesus.

215
00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:31.515
Now, we'll read it in historical context, of course,

216
00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:35.435
but it has to be read for us through that lens.

217
00:10:36.445 --> 00:10:40.475
We've got to read it Christianly like we're not reading it

218
00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:42.595
as they did 3000 years ago.

219
00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:46.235
We're reading it now, knowing how it points us

220
00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:48.515
to the eternal story of redemption.

221
00:10:48.575 --> 00:10:51.795
God is weaving how it points us to

222
00:10:52.295 --> 00:10:55.275
how God was making right, what went wrong in the garden,

223
00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:56.475
how it shows us

224
00:10:56.785 --> 00:10:58.955
what he was doing primarily through the story of David.

225
00:10:59.005 --> 00:11:01.395
We'll see that. But ultimately,

226
00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:04.235
how he was bringing about this Messiah

227
00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:08.315
and how he continued the narrative, continued the story

228
00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:09.555
to bring about the Messiah at

229
00:11:09.555 --> 00:11:10.635
the right time in the right place.

230
00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:15.735
We'll see types of Christ all through the narrative, right?

231
00:11:15.795 --> 00:11:18.175
The the figure of what he will be like.

232
00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:19.535
We'll see it in one Samuel.

233
00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:22.535
We'll see how it shows us who God is

234
00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:25.215
and who he is going to be for them in the Messiah.

235
00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:29.435
It's starkly clear when we start to look

236
00:11:29.435 --> 00:11:33.575
through those lenses so we could look at more questions,

237
00:11:33.575 --> 00:11:35.975
foundational things, but I think that's good enough

238
00:11:35.975 --> 00:11:37.735
to get us down the road as we go forward.

239
00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:40.575
Now, what we need to do is set the context for

240
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.895
where we're at in this grand narrative of redemption.

241
00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:48.055
Where are we even situated as we look at First Samuel,

242
00:11:48.105 --> 00:11:49.255
where does it fit in?

243
00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:53.525
Well, first Samuel Reeds like a,

244
00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:55.325
a civics class in high school.

245
00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:58.685
What it does is it records for later generations

246
00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:01.765
of Israelites how they got their form of government.

247
00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:04.285
What was good about it? What was bad about it?

248
00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:06.925
Just like when you take social studies in elementary school

249
00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:09.525
or you take government in high school or college and,

250
00:12:09.665 --> 00:12:12.085
and it shows like, here's how the development happened

251
00:12:12.105 --> 00:12:13.525
of our government here.

252
00:12:13.895 --> 00:12:16.645
First Samuel is how that happened for Israel,

253
00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:21.085
how they transitioned from judges to a monarchy.

254
00:12:21.795 --> 00:12:23.445
What was good and bad about it.

255
00:12:25.635 --> 00:12:28.535
But that didn't start there, right?

256
00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:30.625
So there's a story before that.

257
00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:33.545
So we've gotta find where we fit in.

258
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.145
Well, let's go back a lot further.

259
00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:39.225
Remember how God chose Abraham

260
00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:45.315
to be a nation set apart for his purposes, to have

261
00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:48.875
many sons and daughters that would bless all nations

262
00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:52.555
through him, a distinct nation that would then come

263
00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:54.555
through his promised son, Isaac,

264
00:12:56.415 --> 00:12:59.795
who then had a son named Jacob who received the same promise

265
00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:01.835
that Abraham received before him.

266
00:13:03.635 --> 00:13:04.725
Well, then if you recall, one

267
00:13:04.725 --> 00:13:08.965
of Jacob's sons was named Joseph, whose brothers hated him

268
00:13:09.385 --> 00:13:11.725
and sold him into slavery in Egypt.

269
00:13:11.945 --> 00:13:13.045
But that was God's plan

270
00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:16.685
because when Joseph was in Egypt, he was risen to power.

271
00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:20.285
And when he was in power, was able to save many nations

272
00:13:20.285 --> 00:13:21.965
because of what he had done.

273
00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:25.925
Well, what happened as part of that was Jacob

274
00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:29.605
and his family are brought to Egypt with Joseph.

275
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.685
They're protected, and they eventually grow to this

276
00:13:33.195 --> 00:13:35.565
huge nation within Egypt.

277
00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:41.245
Well, a Pharaoh comes along later that doesn't know Joseph,

278
00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:45.525
and he sees how big this nation is inside his own borders,

279
00:13:45.745 --> 00:13:46.765
and he gets a little afraid.

280
00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:49.285
And so he says, you're all my slaves now.

281
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:54.215
And he enslaves the people of Israel, makes them

282
00:13:54.725 --> 00:13:56.095
captive in that.

283
00:13:56.155 --> 00:14:00.535
But God still was working with that distinct nation,

284
00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:03.055
and he delivers his people out of slavery

285
00:14:03.055 --> 00:14:04.935
through the plagues, through the Red Sea,

286
00:14:05.075 --> 00:14:07.255
and through 40 years of rebellious,

287
00:14:07.255 --> 00:14:08.735
wandering through the wilderness.

288
00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:12.455
He brings them by Moses' leadership to the edge

289
00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:13.655
of the Promised Land.

290
00:14:13.795 --> 00:14:16.015
That's effectively Genesis through Deuteronomy,

291
00:14:16.675 --> 00:14:17.855
the first five books of the Bible.

292
00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:21.295
That's the story. Well,

293
00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:22.735
the next book of the Bible is called Joshua.

294
00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.935
Joshua was the one who followed Moses in

295
00:14:24.935 --> 00:14:26.015
leadership of God's people.

296
00:14:26.195 --> 00:14:28.895
And he led them into the promised land where they were able

297
00:14:28.895 --> 00:14:31.415
to drive out their enemies and begin to settle in the land.

298
00:14:31.635 --> 00:14:33.815
But they weren't fully there yet.

299
00:14:34.525 --> 00:14:36.335
Because what comes next is judges.

300
00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:40.415
Judges is what God put in place to lead

301
00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:41.535
and protect his people.

302
00:14:41.535 --> 00:14:45.575
Even though it's a loosely Confederated tribes of 12

303
00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:49.455
in one place with one religion, there was this need

304
00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:52.485
to be protected and they were mostly safe.

305
00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:55.125
And what that does is that brings us to one Samuel.

306
00:14:57.445 --> 00:14:59.785
And so we're gonna put a little chart on the screen,

307
00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:01.905
and this is gonna be, this is where we're at,

308
00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:03.305
the transition period.

309
00:15:04.485 --> 00:15:05.585
You might wanna take a picture of that.

310
00:15:05.585 --> 00:15:06.585
We're gonna kind of walk through

311
00:15:06.585 --> 00:15:07.625
it through the next couple months.

312
00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:12.505
That's what we can see is this process God has brought us to

313
00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:16.765
of judges, protecting.

314
00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:19.285
They're in the land, they're somewhat safe,

315
00:15:20.875 --> 00:15:23.885
they're loosely connected, but there's no central authority.

316
00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:29.655
And what happens in one Samuel is this shift to a monarchy.

317
00:15:31.085 --> 00:15:34.625
To a kingship. That's what you see here.

318
00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:35.825
The main characters are involved.

319
00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:37.865
You see kind of the pathway, how they overlapped.

320
00:15:38.085 --> 00:15:39.185
You see Saul and David,

321
00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.505
who are the two primary players in all of this, but,

322
00:15:41.645 --> 00:15:45.065
but this is the historical reality, the factual information

323
00:15:45.405 --> 00:15:47.665
of what happens in one Samuel as a result

324
00:15:47.665 --> 00:15:49.225
of God's story, getting them here.

325
00:15:52.055 --> 00:15:53.755
But you look at that, and it's not enough though,

326
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:59.225
because yes, that's the facts, that's the history of this.

327
00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:04.205
But those narratives are not only, I said this

328
00:16:04.205 --> 00:16:06.285
before, they're not only history.

329
00:16:07.615 --> 00:16:09.105
There's a theological purpose

330
00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:12.465
to teach us something about God first

331
00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:14.225
and about ourselves in relation to that.

332
00:16:17.035 --> 00:16:19.055
So we'll get, we got the history, we got the context,

333
00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:22.215
but now what we need to see is the themes we'll see

334
00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.735
throughout First Samuel,

335
00:16:25.715 --> 00:16:27.605
what will God teach us?

336
00:16:28.595 --> 00:16:31.925
What he will he remind us of throughout this book?

337
00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:36.835
It's exciting, it's narrative.

338
00:16:36.835 --> 00:16:38.675
And some of the favorite stories we know

339
00:16:38.675 --> 00:16:40.555
and love are in First Samuel, but,

340
00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:41.755
but what do we do with it?

341
00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:44.195
What is, what's God trying to teach us?

342
00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:46.835
Well, there's, I'm just gonna give six today.

343
00:16:46.835 --> 00:16:48.115
There's probably way more, but,

344
00:16:48.295 --> 00:16:50.115
but we wanna keep our eyes open for him as we work

345
00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:51.475
through the next few weeks.

346
00:16:51.565 --> 00:16:53.595
First, the words

347
00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:58.435
of God is a major theme in First Samuel, the words of God.

348
00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:03.085
If you remember I said, a thousand years

349
00:17:03.085 --> 00:17:04.565
before Jesus shows up,

350
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.685
that means there was no finalized canon of scripture.

351
00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:12.605
We don't, uh, we we have this as a result of the process.

352
00:17:12.905 --> 00:17:16.125
The early church went through to canonize the scriptures.

353
00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:18.605
Well, they didn't have that a thousand years before Jesus.

354
00:17:20.565 --> 00:17:24.065
So prophets were essential back then.

355
00:17:25.975 --> 00:17:28.095
Prophets were the very mouthpieces of God.

356
00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:31.575
They were speaking God's word to the people of God.

357
00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:35.055
And over and over in one Samuel will see how important words

358
00:17:35.795 --> 00:17:40.295
are, whether God spoke himself

359
00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:43.535
or whether he was using his words through people.

360
00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:45.895
God was blessing. God was cursing.

361
00:17:46.035 --> 00:17:49.175
God was bringing about His will through words.

362
00:17:50.215 --> 00:17:54.685
Often we'll see it again.

363
00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:59.365
He's a primary player. He's not absent. He's involved.

364
00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:03.085
He's directing in many ways with His word.

365
00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:08.205
And along with that, we'll see the holiness of God.

366
00:18:10.145 --> 00:18:11.765
We see his words are important and we'll see.

367
00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:13.845
The holiness of God is very important.

368
00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:18.535
In one Samuel, there's actually a couple pretty shocking

369
00:18:18.715 --> 00:18:20.855
scenes in one Samuel

370
00:18:20.855 --> 00:18:24.015
where God vindicates his name pretty forcefully.

371
00:18:25.695 --> 00:18:28.225
Like we'll watch how he deals with religious leaders who

372
00:18:29.015 --> 00:18:32.825
mock him and, and handle his name with irreverence.

373
00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:37.705
We'll see how he handles false gods and idols.

374
00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:42.665
In fact, one of my favorite stories in scripture is in one

375
00:18:42.665 --> 00:18:46.105
Samuel five where there was this God that was being set up,

376
00:18:46.295 --> 00:18:47.385
name was Dagon.

377
00:18:48.685 --> 00:18:50.185
Now Dagon was a god of fertility.

378
00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:52.185
And they had this wooden, or, or,

379
00:18:52.565 --> 00:18:56.425
or a stone image of Dagon in a temple

380
00:18:56.655 --> 00:18:57.745
that they would go to worship.

381
00:18:57.805 --> 00:18:59.465
And these were nations right around Israel.

382
00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:03.215
Well, we'll see this arc of the covenant, the presence

383
00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:07.255
of God, uh, symbol in e in Israel was, was taken

384
00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:09.855
and it was put in front of Dagon

385
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:11.175
as kind of like, look, we won.

386
00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:14.455
Well, the next morning they come in the temple

387
00:19:14.715 --> 00:19:16.615
and that massive stone

388
00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:19.655
or wood idol was flat on his face

389
00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:21.055
right in front of the Ark of the Covenant.

390
00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:24.615
So they're like, okay,

391
00:19:24.615 --> 00:19:25.855
there must have been an earthquake or something.

392
00:19:25.855 --> 00:19:27.575
I dunno what they were thinking. But then the,

393
00:19:27.595 --> 00:19:28.655
so they set him back up.

394
00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:31.215
They notice, they set the God back up

395
00:19:33.725 --> 00:19:36.945
the next morning they come in, not only is he faced down,

396
00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:38.905
his head's cut off and his arms are cut off.

397
00:19:40.885 --> 00:19:42.745
Who did that? God did.

398
00:19:43.925 --> 00:19:46.545
God was vindicating his holiness saying, you don't mess

399
00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:49.785
with me and no God can stand against me.

400
00:19:49.965 --> 00:19:53.505
That's just a picture of what we're going to be faced with

401
00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:56.945
as we walk through one Samuel God vindicating his holiness,

402
00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.865
which means we will be confronted

403
00:19:59.805 --> 00:20:03.065
in the same way with that question.

404
00:20:03.165 --> 00:20:04.825
Who can stand before this?

405
00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:09.455
Holy God, who can stand

406
00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:15.725
and, and we know apart from Christ, we are face down.

407
00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:20.385
We have no reason to stand before God. He is holy.

408
00:20:20.435 --> 00:20:24.945
We're not apart from Christ intervention. We will be undone.

409
00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:31.605
So we'll see the holiness of God here, which leads

410
00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.645
to the third theme very closely related,

411
00:20:33.745 --> 00:20:35.885
the depravity of humankind.

412
00:20:38.285 --> 00:20:40.575
This is in one Samuel, the depravity of humankind.

413
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:42.455
What we see it over

414
00:20:42.455 --> 00:20:46.295
and over again, how wicked people can get.

415
00:20:47.785 --> 00:20:50.125
And we typically, I I've been wrestling

416
00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.765
with this a little myself in the last few weeks.

417
00:20:51.865 --> 00:20:55.045
We typically have a much higher view

418
00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:56.845
of ourselves than we ought to, right?

419
00:20:58.355 --> 00:21:00.255
We, we tend to view ourselves really highly.

420
00:21:02.415 --> 00:21:06.595
And I think it shows up often when we read about characters

421
00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:09.195
in the Bible who sin in big ways.

422
00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:12.605
Like we'll read stuff in one Samuel

423
00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:13.845
or elsewhere in the Bible,

424
00:21:13.945 --> 00:21:15.605
and we'll, we'll read what they did.

425
00:21:15.605 --> 00:21:17.725
And we're like, how in the world could you ever do that?

426
00:21:19.905 --> 00:21:21.215
Maybe I'm the only one who says this,

427
00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:22.815
but like, do you not see?

428
00:21:23.275 --> 00:21:25.535
Did, did you not know what was about to come?

429
00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:30.135
And we, we think there's no way I could have ever done that.

430
00:21:32.265 --> 00:21:35.715
Ooh, let's be careful with that.

431
00:21:35.735 --> 00:21:37.595
That's a pretty arrogant statement, isn't it?

432
00:21:42.265 --> 00:21:43.845
How deceived we are.

433
00:21:46.945 --> 00:21:49.605
Now, it is true that in Christ, if you are in Christ,

434
00:21:49.605 --> 00:21:51.925
you don't have to sin like that.

435
00:21:54.775 --> 00:21:58.755
But I want you to hear what God inspired the Apostle Paul

436
00:21:58.775 --> 00:22:00.435
to write in one Corinthians 10,

437
00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.805
as he was thinking about stories like we're about

438
00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:06.645
to read in one Samuel, those stories of utter failure

439
00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.085
and mess in people's lives.

440
00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:12.125
Listen to this. Now, these things took place as examples

441
00:22:12.145 --> 00:22:14.685
for us that we might not desire.

442
00:22:14.755 --> 00:22:19.195
Evil as they did, do not be idolaters as some of them were.

443
00:22:19.535 --> 00:22:21.675
As it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink

444
00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:23.195
and rose up to play, meaning they were

445
00:22:23.195 --> 00:22:24.755
cherishing those things more than God.

446
00:22:25.015 --> 00:22:27.635
We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some

447
00:22:27.635 --> 00:22:31.435
of them did, and 23,000 died in a single day.

448
00:22:32.175 --> 00:22:34.955
We must not put Christ to the test as some of them did

449
00:22:35.095 --> 00:22:36.675
and we're destroyed by serpents

450
00:22:37.885 --> 00:22:39.265
nor grumble as some of them did,

451
00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:41.105
and we're destroyed by the destroyer.

452
00:22:42.905 --> 00:22:45.285
Now, these things happen to them as an example,

453
00:22:45.705 --> 00:22:48.285
but they were written down for our instruction

454
00:22:49.265 --> 00:22:51.725
on whom the end of the ages has come.

455
00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:54.365
Now listen to this. Check out verse 12.

456
00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:58.715
Therefore, let anyone who thinks that he stands

457
00:22:59.305 --> 00:23:00.835
take heed lest he fall.

458
00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:06.695
Meaning don't be arrogant.

459
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.905
Be warned by those stories.

460
00:23:14.595 --> 00:23:18.225
No, I I could never do that. No, no, no.

461
00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:22.105
Be warned that there are consequences to sin.

462
00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:25.985
There's consequences to rebellion that we, we know the grace

463
00:23:25.985 --> 00:23:27.145
of God covers us, but

464
00:23:27.145 --> 00:23:28.905
that doesn't give us license to do whatever we want.

465
00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:33.065
We know that this causes this. You reap what you sow.

466
00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:34.825
There's consequence to it.

467
00:23:34.965 --> 00:23:37.345
So instead of just saying, well, the grace of God covers me,

468
00:23:37.345 --> 00:23:38.785
how about we just avoid it to begin with

469
00:23:39.765 --> 00:23:41.625
and not have to go through the pain and sorrow?

470
00:23:42.365 --> 00:23:44.905
That's what these stories are meant to show us.

471
00:23:45.045 --> 00:23:47.045
It's like, well, I don't wanna do what that guy did.

472
00:23:48.505 --> 00:23:50.625
I see the consequence. I wanna avoid that.

473
00:23:51.595 --> 00:23:54.585
We'll see the depravity of humankind

474
00:23:54.605 --> 00:23:56.465
and the consequence to it here.

475
00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:01.625
Here's the next theme we're gonna see in one Samuel,

476
00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:03.305
it's the responsibilities of leaders.

477
00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:07.615
Again, with the kingship idea,

478
00:24:07.615 --> 00:24:09.055
the responsibilities of leaders.

479
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:11.615
Both the qualifications of leaders,

480
00:24:11.715 --> 00:24:13.855
but also what they are to do.

481
00:24:15.505 --> 00:24:17.335
We'll see good leaders, we'll see bad leaders.

482
00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:23.295
We will see God's standard for leaders.

483
00:24:24.875 --> 00:24:28.535
And we'll see what happens when people pick leaders based on

484
00:24:28.535 --> 00:24:30.775
some other standard than what God said.

485
00:24:31.895 --> 00:24:33.435
It doesn't go well,

486
00:24:33.435 --> 00:24:35.595
and it's gonna be instructive for us who are leaders.

487
00:24:35.685 --> 00:24:37.715
It'll be instructive to those who want to be leaders.

488
00:24:37.855 --> 00:24:39.595
But it's gonna be instructive for all of us

489
00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:41.275
because we all have influence on other people

490
00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:46.005
and we're called to lead them, whether it's as parents

491
00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:49.045
or coworkers or bosses or fellow students.

492
00:24:49.235 --> 00:24:52.285
It's leadership. This is what we are to do.

493
00:24:52.705 --> 00:24:54.605
Yet in the end, it will point us back

494
00:24:54.605 --> 00:24:56.485
to Christ who's our ultimate leader.

495
00:24:57.615 --> 00:24:59.355
The only perfect one that we can follow.

496
00:25:01.685 --> 00:25:02.975
That was number four. Here's the fifth,

497
00:25:04.235 --> 00:25:05.575
the sovereignty of God.

498
00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.705
I mean, we could put this as a theme

499
00:25:08.725 --> 00:25:10.185
for everything of course in the Bible.

500
00:25:10.205 --> 00:25:14.145
But this one clearly shows up here the sovereignty of God,

501
00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:16.465
that God is fully in control.

502
00:25:18.795 --> 00:25:20.325
Over and over in one Samuel, we'll see

503
00:25:20.325 --> 00:25:24.645
that God ordered events and circumstances for his purpose.

504
00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:26.845
He got people where they needed

505
00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:28.285
to be when they needed to be there.

506
00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:29.965
He told them what they needed to hear,

507
00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:32.205
had them overhear something they needed to overhear,

508
00:25:32.425 --> 00:25:34.525
and he protected who he needed to protect.

509
00:25:34.665 --> 00:25:36.725
He put them where they needed to be so they could be safe.

510
00:25:37.025 --> 00:25:40.645
All of that. God is super intending this whole thing.

511
00:25:40.645 --> 00:25:43.165
In fact, you see God work even when there

512
00:25:43.165 --> 00:25:44.445
seems like there's no way out.

513
00:25:45.605 --> 00:25:46.735
There's worldly ways.

514
00:25:46.885 --> 00:25:49.095
It's nothing ever possible to get outta this.

515
00:25:49.195 --> 00:25:51.335
And God says, no, no, no, that's not a problem for me.

516
00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:54.795
I got this. Let me show you

517
00:25:55.615 --> 00:25:57.715
my glory as I do it.

518
00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:03.225
He's always at work. In fact, he's weaving this story.

519
00:26:03.435 --> 00:26:05.145
We'll watch it happen in one Samuel,

520
00:26:05.405 --> 00:26:08.265
how God weaves this redemption story all throughout

521
00:26:08.845 --> 00:26:11.945
to eventually point us to that Son of David Messiah.

522
00:26:14.545 --> 00:26:15.635
Well, here's the sixth one.

523
00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:18.685
And really I think it, it might be the primary

524
00:26:18.935 --> 00:26:20.565
theme of the book.

525
00:26:20.565 --> 00:26:21.605
They're all important of course.

526
00:26:21.665 --> 00:26:24.765
But this one is number one, the kingship

527
00:26:25.025 --> 00:26:26.605
of God in one Samuel,

528
00:26:28.925 --> 00:26:30.905
the kingship of God.

529
00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:34.355
They're all related, of course, but this one matters

530
00:26:34.385 --> 00:26:37.155
because of the plot line of the book.

531
00:26:39.805 --> 00:26:42.175
Like I said earlier, the central focus is the

532
00:26:42.215 --> 00:26:43.645
monarchy of of Israel.

533
00:26:43.705 --> 00:26:47.995
How they moved from judges to kings, from judges

534
00:26:48.175 --> 00:26:50.595
to one nation under a king.

535
00:26:50.655 --> 00:26:54.715
Now, this is the narrative. Here's the problem with that.

536
00:26:57.065 --> 00:26:58.965
The problem is that that's not the way God

537
00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:00.125
ever wanted it to be.

538
00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:08.825
In fact, it says explicitly, their desire for a king was

539
00:27:08.825 --> 00:27:09.825
because they wanted

540
00:27:09.825 --> 00:27:11.825
to be like all the other nations around them.

541
00:27:16.145 --> 00:27:18.205
Now, God graciously works through this.

542
00:27:18.385 --> 00:27:20.605
He sets up a model king in David.

543
00:27:20.745 --> 00:27:22.325
He points us to the son of David who's gonna

544
00:27:22.325 --> 00:27:23.485
come reign perfectly.

545
00:27:23.785 --> 00:27:26.285
He does that in spite of this.

546
00:27:26.825 --> 00:27:29.165
But remember when God called Israel,

547
00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:32.085
when he redeemed them out of slavery,

548
00:27:32.465 --> 00:27:33.885
he said, you are my own.

549
00:27:34.395 --> 00:27:38.005
What did he say it was for? So they would be distinct.

550
00:27:41.575 --> 00:27:43.375
A holy nation is what he called them.

551
00:27:43.815 --> 00:27:48.095
A people who would point others towards Yahweh.

552
00:27:48.205 --> 00:27:50.935
They would show that God's presence is with them.

553
00:27:51.085 --> 00:27:53.375
They would show that he's promised a redeemer.

554
00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:56.055
That's what he wanted them to be as Israel.

555
00:27:56.245 --> 00:27:58.895
They were not to be like other nations around them.

556
00:28:03.095 --> 00:28:06.145
They already had a king, and his name was Lord God Almighty.

557
00:28:07.775 --> 00:28:10.235
You don't need anybody else. You don't need to be like them.

558
00:28:10.795 --> 00:28:14.155
I am your king, and I want you to be distinct.

559
00:28:17.795 --> 00:28:20.215
You see how instructive this is for us today.

560
00:28:23.195 --> 00:28:25.485
Like do you see how relevant

561
00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:29.775
that very word is for us

562
00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:32.455
even in the age of Christ?

563
00:28:35.485 --> 00:28:39.975
I mean, just listen to how one Peter two verses nine

564
00:28:39.975 --> 00:28:43.515
and 10 says this, but you

565
00:28:44.645 --> 00:28:48.895
Christians, you are a chosen race,

566
00:28:49.775 --> 00:28:53.695
a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people

567
00:28:53.795 --> 00:28:56.175
for his own possession so

568
00:28:56.175 --> 00:28:58.215
that you may proclaim the excellencies of him

569
00:28:58.215 --> 00:29:01.135
who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light once

570
00:29:01.155 --> 00:29:04.215
you were not a people, but now you are God's people.

571
00:29:04.525 --> 00:29:06.015
Once you had not received mercy,

572
00:29:06.315 --> 00:29:08.975
but now you have received mercy, right?

573
00:29:08.975 --> 00:29:11.015
You see that it's the same language

574
00:29:11.245 --> 00:29:13.255
that he used about Israel back then.

575
00:29:13.365 --> 00:29:16.415
It's the same desire he had that by redemption,

576
00:29:16.835 --> 00:29:18.095
we are now God's people.

577
00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:23.615
We are God's people. His holy nation, meaning we are his.

578
00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:25.335
He is our king.

579
00:29:28.095 --> 00:29:30.895
Continue on verse 11, beloved, I urge you as sojourners

580
00:29:30.895 --> 00:29:33.975
and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh,

581
00:29:34.185 --> 00:29:35.775
which wage war against your soul.

582
00:29:36.085 --> 00:29:40.175
Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so

583
00:29:40.175 --> 00:29:42.325
that when they speak against you as evil doers,

584
00:29:42.435 --> 00:29:43.845
they may see your good deeds

585
00:29:43.845 --> 00:29:46.365
and glorify God on the day of visitation.

586
00:29:48.015 --> 00:29:50.045
Again, the same purpose.

587
00:29:50.465 --> 00:29:54.525
He wants us to be distinct, to point

588
00:29:54.525 --> 00:29:58.965
to God's presence with us, to point to his redeemer for us.

589
00:29:59.185 --> 00:30:02.645
That's why he's made us a holy nation.

590
00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:06.805
And did you see the words in there, sojourners and exiles?

591
00:30:09.135 --> 00:30:11.725
Peter was writing to people who were in exile.

592
00:30:11.945 --> 00:30:13.845
But there's other scriptures you tie with that,

593
00:30:13.915 --> 00:30:17.165
that we are sojourners and exiles as believers.

594
00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.965
Meaning we are not home here.

595
00:30:22.555 --> 00:30:25.605
This is not home. This is a temporary dwelling place.

596
00:30:25.695 --> 00:30:30.515
Until we do get home, someday, we're living somewhere else

597
00:30:30.575 --> 00:30:33.875
for now until we finally get home.

598
00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:37.835
What that means is that we are not of this worldly kingdom,

599
00:30:42.235 --> 00:30:45.425
Which means we shouldn't look for a king here

600
00:30:46.485 --> 00:30:49.865
to bring in some kingdom version here.

601
00:30:53.245 --> 00:30:58.225
Why? 'cause we already have a king. We already have a king.

602
00:30:58.835 --> 00:31:01.225
We're a holy nation with a king

603
00:31:01.285 --> 00:31:05.945
who reigns over us forever and ever and ever.

604
00:31:06.325 --> 00:31:07.945
That's our hope.

605
00:31:08.165 --> 00:31:11.665
He installs kings and leaders as he sees fit. Absolutely.

606
00:31:11.845 --> 00:31:14.225
Are they subject to his commands? Absolutely.

607
00:31:14.365 --> 00:31:16.825
But it's him who's going to reign forever

608
00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:18.745
and ever over his kingdom.

609
00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:24.795
So I know we agree with that in our heads,

610
00:31:25.855 --> 00:31:29.275
but the challenge is that we keep him there in our hearts.

611
00:31:31.965 --> 00:31:36.015
That that throne is occupied by him alone. Nothing else.

612
00:31:36.275 --> 00:31:39.255
No one else. No hope other than him.

613
00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:45.725
Are we keeping him there? That'll be a question

614
00:31:46.665 --> 00:31:47.765
as we walk through one.

615
00:31:47.765 --> 00:31:51.525
Samuel, what is taking that throne away

616
00:31:52.495 --> 00:31:54.025
from the one who rightly sits on it?

617
00:31:57.725 --> 00:32:01.165
Israel's demand for a king was a rejection of God.

618
00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:07.715
May it never be. So for us as families, as individuals,

619
00:32:07.715 --> 00:32:10.755
as a church, may it never be so for us, even

620
00:32:12.205 --> 00:32:16.555
to any extent that we say, no,

621
00:32:16.775 --> 00:32:19.015
my way's better God not yours.

622
00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:23.275
So I want you to just bow your head for a second,

623
00:32:23.335 --> 00:32:27.315
to invite you to something, to just focus.

624
00:32:29.115 --> 00:32:31.625
Close our head, close, close our eyes and bow our heads.

625
00:32:31.645 --> 00:32:35.755
And we look at, look at what God wants

626
00:32:35.815 --> 00:32:37.235
to show to us in this.

627
00:32:42.685 --> 00:32:45.665
So I would just invite you now to consider

628
00:32:48.035 --> 00:32:52.575
your need for God, your need

629
00:32:52.675 --> 00:32:54.695
for a king.

630
00:32:58.125 --> 00:33:00.185
How So often we run to these other

631
00:33:01.825 --> 00:33:06.385
little K kings looking

632
00:33:06.525 --> 00:33:09.385
for answers, looking for hope

633
00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:13.675
and life instead of realizing the king of kings

634
00:33:13.675 --> 00:33:16.755
and Lord of Lords is already on that throne.

635
00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:23.745
And we can trust it. We can be satisfied in.

636
00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:27.745
And so that's the question today,

637
00:33:29.295 --> 00:33:31.905
does he rule in your life?

638
00:33:37.695 --> 00:33:41.145
Have you said, God, I'm yours.

639
00:33:41.835 --> 00:33:45.185
Everything is yours. You are my king.

640
00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:48.945
You are my Lord. You are the one

641
00:33:48.945 --> 00:33:50.705
who calls the shots, directs traffic.

642
00:33:50.885 --> 00:33:51.985
You are everything

643
00:33:56.165 --> 00:33:57.305
and you are my savior.

644
00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:02.585
And you recognize you need salvation because of your sin

645
00:34:03.685 --> 00:34:05.345
and your rebellion against God.

646
00:34:06.525 --> 00:34:09.745
And you say, God, I need you to save me from your wrath.

647
00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:18.755
It's the only way through that son of David, Jesus Christ,

648
00:34:20.935 --> 00:34:22.035
who has done it all for you.

649
00:34:22.135 --> 00:34:23.195
That's the only way.

650
00:34:27.295 --> 00:34:30.755
But it's not one or the other. It's king and Savior.

651
00:34:32.255 --> 00:34:33.875
That's how he comes.

652
00:34:36.335 --> 00:34:41.115
So just reflect for a second, consider for a moment how,

653
00:34:42.535 --> 00:34:44.675
how that plays out day to day for you

654
00:34:47.695 --> 00:34:48.795
and run to him in that.
