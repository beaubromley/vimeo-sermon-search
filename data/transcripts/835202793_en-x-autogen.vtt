1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.100
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.420
I will not fear for you are with me. You are my light and my salvation.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.900
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.180
I long to dwell in your house forever.

5
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.420
Well, good morning. My name's Phil Sli.

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.340
I'm the pastor of discipleship and community here at Henderson Hills Baptist

7
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.300
Church. And I want to thank Pastor John and our elder council for giving me the

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.700
opportunity to preach God's word and to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.

9
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.900
It's good to be here today.

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.420
And I also wanna say for a moment that my good friend David Amon has, um,

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.620
driven up here from Tulsa, Oklahoma to see me preach.

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.020
And what I was thinking today is I was walking into the building, as you know,

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.020
I met David Amon about 55 years ago at vacation Bible school. And,

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.100
uh, we were discipled together and we grew up loving the Lord together.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.060
And so he's here to support me this morning. So, uh,

16
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.180
if you have your Bibles turn to Psalm 56. While you're turning there,

17
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.420
I wanna give a little backstory.

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.500
We know that sin separated humanity from God and,

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.940
and God immediately made a promise to the serpent, the personification of evil.

20
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.220
And he said, the offspring of a woman will crush your head.

21
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.260
So that's the first gospel proclamation.

22
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.100
That's the first gospel prophecy that it would one day result in the coming

23
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.900
of a deliverer to give us hope.

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.140
And you and I know that this prophecy finds its fulfillment in Jesus through

25
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.900
his death and burial and resurrection.

26
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.220
He is the deliverer and that's the gospel.

27
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.420
Jesus tri triumphed over Satan through his death barrel and resurrection.

28
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.540
So that's the good news and that's the gospel later. And that happened in, uh,

29
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.900
Genesis three. Later in Genesis 12,

30
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.740
God makes another promise and he promises Abram, he says,

31
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.820
and now Abraham's an old man with a barren wife, and he says,

32
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.300
you're going to have a son. And uh,

33
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.500
that son is going to be the beginning of a great nation.

34
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.060
And so God keeps his promises. And that's exactly what happened,

35
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.900
that God's offspring would bless all the nations of the earth and that

36
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.820
eventually ended up in Jesus. But, but God's people,

37
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.700
this little family,

38
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.340
God guided them and protected them and then warned them as they began to grow,

39
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.580
not to put anything else first.

40
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.660
And if they did that there would be consequences.

41
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.900
And so he promised them a land and he gave them a land and he promised them a

42
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.140
temple and he gave them a temple.

43
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.020
But any way they did what they did, they turned away from God,

44
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.340
even against the warnings,

45
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.180
and they ignored his prophets and they begin to make other gods

46
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.580
and worship other gods. And so consequently,

47
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.180
God allowed his temple to be destroyed and for his people to be exiled away

48
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.740
from the land and away from the temple for 370 years,

49
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.040
that is where they had worshiped God as he promised that they would.

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.360
But because of their rebellion,

51
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.600
God's people were exiled away from the land and the temple and the Psalms as

52
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.493
we read them,

53
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.880
this was how God's people worshiped him away from their home,

54
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.600
away from their temple. So in this Psalm 56, it says,

55
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.040
it's to the choir master.

56
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.920
And so it was sung by Abraham's offspring,

57
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.360
God's people in exile. And so the Psalms helped them draw,

58
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.880
draw close to God even when they were far away from home.

59
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.120
The Psalms became like a hymnal or a prayer book,

60
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.440
poems for exiled Israelis. The word psalm is a Greek word.

61
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.440
It means the plucking of the strings. And so, uh, God's people sung these poems,

62
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.280
sung these songs as they were accompanied by string instruments.

63
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.400
And I didn't know this,

64
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.520
but the Psalms are the world's largest collection of ancient poetry.

65
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.560
And they transcend time and they point us to God. They reveal God,

66
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.600
how he is long suffering, how he inspires us, how he's powerful,

67
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.120
how he's holy, how he's merciful, how he's God, and how he's love,

68
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.280
and because of his love, how he's with us in suffering.

69
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.960
So why do we study the Psalms? They help us understand,

70
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.280
they help us understand God,

71
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.480
they help us understand ourselves and they help us understand how we relate to

72
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.880
God in every experience,

73
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.440
even in grave danger and terrible difficulty. So,

74
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.840
uh, in Psalms 56, if you wanna turn there in verse one,

75
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.840
most of you have in your translation what's called

76
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.960
a superscript or a title. And uh, this is a very reliable,

77
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.480
uh, recent scholar.

78
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.400
Scholarly evidence suggests that these titles were connected to the text and

79
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.240
essential for understanding it puts these psalms in a specific context.

80
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.920
And so we have to look at it very closely. It says,

81
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.200
according to the dove of the far off terebinth.

82
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.800
Now nobody knows what that means, but it probably means that it was to be sung.

83
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.800
This psalm was to be sung to another tune called the Dove of the Far

84
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.680
Offterin. Now, we've all done that when I was a youth minister,

85
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.800
we used to sing amazing grace to different tunes just to get the kids singing.

86
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.960
Uh, I'll sing it and you tell me what it's from. Okay? Uh, amazing grace,

87
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.960
how sweet the sound that saved a res like me, that's house the Rising Sun.

88
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.680
For those of you under the age of 40, I'm sorry,

89
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.400
all my illustrations come from the seventies. Some of you'll get it,

90
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.240
some of you won't. Here's another one,

91
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.240
amazing Grace House Sweet of sound that saved a rats like me. Yeah,

92
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.720
Gilligans Island. Let's hear it for Gilligan. Now,

93
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.440
please don't clap on that one. Okay, well that's what this is a song,

94
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.960
song to a different song.

95
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.840
But the next couple of phrases are very critical for us. And that is this,

96
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.840
that, uh, this is a Mi of David or a MIT of David.

97
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.000
What that means is, is that we don't really know what that means.

98
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.320
We do know that in the Hebrew it means poem, but it's probably a musical term.

99
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.320
And we know that the next four Psalms, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60,

100
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.400
these are going to be mitts,

101
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.280
which means that this is us responding to God in the middle of a grave danger.

102
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.480
And so this is the first truth that you can write in your notes that in the face

103
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.320
of grave danger, God's people need to know He has not abandoned them,

104
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.640
nor has he abandoned his mission in the world.

105
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.920
So God is with you even when you don't feel like it.

106
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.080
And he has not abandoned you in the middle of difficult circumstances. In fact,

107
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.960
he's gonna provide for you hope and assurance for whatever danger or difficulty

108
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.040
come and he will accomplish his mission in the world.

109
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.440
And you can be certain of that. So the Supers subscriptions here says this,

110
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.400
and this is perhaps the most important piece of contextual, uh,

111
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.720
information when the Philistines seized him in goth.

112
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.440
Now we're gentiles. We don't know where Philis the Philistines lived.

113
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.600
We don't know where goth is. We certainly don't know who king ish is,

114
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.920
but David did.

115
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.480
And so keep your finger in Psalms 36 and then turn back for Samuel

116
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.453
21.

117
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.400
I'm gonna read to you five verses they're gonna establish the context of when

118
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.320
this psalm was written and what were the circumstance of grave danger.

119
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.280
And it says in David Rose and fled that day from Saul and went to King that

120
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.040
Aish, the king of goth. And the servants of Aish said to him,

121
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.800
is this not David the king of the land? Do they not sing to one another of him?

122
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.080
In in dances,

123
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.280
Saul has struck down his thousands and David his 10 thousands.

124
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.200
And David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Aish,

125
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.920
the king of guy.

126
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.400
So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane

127
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.920
in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let spit run

128
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.680
down his beard. Then Aish said to his servants, behold,

129
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.920
you see the man is mad. Why then, have you brought him to me?

130
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.800
Do I lack of mad men?

131
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.200
Have you brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence?

132
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.680
Shall this fallow fellow come into my house? Well,

133
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.200
Psalms 56 reminds me of a prayer method that many of you're familiar with.

134
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.680
And if you're not, you need to be. It's called palms up, palms down.

135
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.720
And some of you know about this, but it's a prayer method that goes back a very,

136
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.120
very long time. In fact, nobody knows really where it started.

137
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.960
The earliest rec recorded use of this prayer method is by Ignatius

138
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.440
in, uh, a program he called examine. But, uh, in this prayer method,

139
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.120
you were encouraged to kind of hold your hands in your labs.

140
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.080
As you sit and palms up is you receiving

141
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.240
God's grace, his forgiveness,

142
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.840
you receiving God's mercy and his forgiveness and blessings and

143
00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:00.080
palms down is when you are surrendering, you surrender your fears,

144
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.880
your anxieties, your worries, your distractions, your rebellion.

145
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.840
And that's what this, this psalm reminds me of the palms up, palms down method.

146
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.360
Because at the very beginning in the first two verses,

147
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.400
David May be at the lowest point in his life, he's lost almost everything.

148
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.440
His best friend Jonathan, his wife McCall, he's lost his family,

149
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.480
his reputation, his honor, his position in the, in Sal's kingdom.

150
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.960
He's lost everything,

151
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.720
but he's been promised by God and been anointed to be Israel's next

152
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.880
king by Samuel. So Israel's first king was Saul,

153
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.800
and he's growing increasingly jealous of David. In fact,

154
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.840
he's tried to commit murder against David four times now that we know of.

155
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.520
In fact, Bible says David was good looking,

156
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.280
which I don't know why it has to include that.

157
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.240
It says he had good looking eyes and he was ready in appearance and yeah,

158
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.200
whatever. And I could, I'm beginning to feel a little like Saul here, right?

159
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.240
He had miraculously killed the Philistine monster Goliath. I mean,

160
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.280
for goodness sake, one swing, one stone, one kill.

161
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.320
And so Saul is,

162
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.320
is increasingly jealous and he tries to murder David.

163
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.680
And so out of options and engrave danger,

164
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.600
he runs away to Israel's enemy, the Philistines.

165
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.320
And now in the hands of Israel's enemy,

166
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.720
he thinks faking insanity is his best option.

167
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.680
I never spit on myself, but I've done some stupid things over the years and,

168
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.560
and I don't see any hands, but I know there should be a few, right?

169
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.000
Today as we learn, even at his lowest point in life,

170
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.160
David hasn't lost everything. In fact, he has all he needs.

171
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.560
David has God's word and David has God's promise from Samuel. So we read,

172
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.680
first of all, palms down of David's terror.

173
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.760
Psalm 56, 1 and two says, be gracious to me. Oh God,

174
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.480
for man tramples on me all day long. And an attacker oppresses me.

175
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.640
My enemies trample on me all day long for many attack me

176
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.680
proudly. So Davis Re is releasing this terror.

177
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.200
This is an urgent appeal for God's help. He's crushed, he's flattened,

178
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.240
he's run over, he's stepped on, he's stomped on.

179
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.320
He is aish doormat.

180
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.360
He's being trampled and attacked all day long. Uh,

181
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.360
we've heard Bible scholars teach us that if something is repeated,

182
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.520
it needs to be reminded. And in these two verses,

183
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.720
it's repeated twice and once more after this all day long,

184
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.760
all day long, he's literally in between a rock and a hard place.

185
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.280
Rock being king's, Saul in God's armies and the hard place being king,

186
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.560
aka God in his armies.

187
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.360
And what we need to learn here is not a very fun thing to learn.

188
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.760
And that is this, that when we are in great need,

189
00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.040
we will even run to danger to find relief.

190
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.270
The Philistines, these are Goliaths people.

191
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.430
They had hatred and anger against David when they sing.

192
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.710
David killed his 10 thousands. Those are 10,000 Philistine casualties.

193
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.710
He was hard pressed on every side.

194
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.710
And in his exhaustion then David's fear turns to God, David's trust.

195
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.750
We go from terror to trust. And these are palms off.

196
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.070
Now we know that a palms up.

197
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.430
We know that trust means that I have a firm belief in the reality and

198
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.470
the truth into the strength of God. I know that God is with me.

199
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.630
I know that God can do this. And this is what he says in verse three.

200
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.790
When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.

201
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.270
In God whose word I praise in God,

202
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.750
I trust and I will not be afraid for what can flesh do to

203
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.190
me? David being attacked on all sides. He knows God's promises.

204
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.270
And while he is still running,

205
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:03.430
he admits his crippling anxiety when I am afraid.

206
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.630
And if you've never been afraid, you are in denial. In fact,

207
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.430
I've heard recently from very scholarly resources that much of

208
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.630
American culture is afraid.

209
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.030
Many things are happening that are outside of our control. Geopolitically,

210
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.750
economically, physiologically,

211
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.990
I'm laughing cuz I'm getting old and I'm t I'm tired and sore and I don't know

212
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.190
why. You know, used to, like I say,

213
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.390
that's cuz that's what I did and that made me sore. Now it's just sore, right?

214
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.470
But there are so many things that are outside of our control that make us

215
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.790
afraid. And fact, our, our kids are turning away from church,

216
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.310
they're falling out of church and we don't know why and we can't seem to talk

217
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.190
them into coming back.

218
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.190
And so they need to see in us that because not not anxiety and

219
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.550
not fear, not distrust. They need to see,

220
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.510
trust David in the depths of anx, uh, his anxiety,

221
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.310
he assures God how much he trusts him.

222
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.950
He repeats it twice when he is afraid he will look to God and as a result,

223
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.470
then he'll not be as afraid. And because of this, he has full confidence of God.

224
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.630
God, you are faithful, you're reliable, you're loving, you're able,

225
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.190
you're strong. In the midst of this terror,

226
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:24.110
God has rock solid trust in God and his character and in God's

227
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.990
promises, David was confident that was,

228
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.470
that God was greater than all of his fears and that God would indeed help him.

229
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.470
Why then should he be afraid?

230
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.190
Are not all of his enemies merely flesh,

231
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.670
but God is God faithful and reliable and able and strong and

232
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.510
he can be trusted and be praised for his promises.

233
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.990
And so here are two things that you can count on for the rest of your life.

234
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.840
Humanity is powerless to prevent God's eternal purposes in life.

235
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.240
And number two, and this one's very um, this one's very meaningful to me

236
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.020
In the final analysis,

237
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:09.500
Jesus is Lord and God's purposes win. Uh,

238
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:14.380
young lady sitting out here and I were married 43 years as of last Wednesday

239
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.220
and we were dating right before I went into the ministry and she wasn't sure she

240
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.020
wanted be a minister's wife. She's still on the bubble about it actually.

241
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.220
But no, actually she's been a great resource to me.

242
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.580
But early on in our ministry we decided that we would fall back

243
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.620
after anything, after any um, glory,

244
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.780
after any praise, after any trial, after any trouble,

245
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.700
after any terror. And there's a lot of that in ministry,

246
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.820
on and on that we would say in the final analysis, Jesus' Lord,

247
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.160
I'm still going to heaven. And God's purpose is when Amen. Well,

248
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.200
David is saying, God, if you're God, what can any mortal man do to me?

249
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.920
There's nothing any mortal man can do except what God in his perfect sovereignty

250
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.903
permits.

251
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.600
And David has figured out that humanity is powerless to prevent God's eternal

252
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.960
purpose from going forward.

253
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.640
Yet this is another palm's down moment. David's trauma.

254
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.910
He says in verse five and six, he's an, he's a fugitive.

255
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.910
He's a refugee flinging for his life. Everybody is suspicious of him.

256
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.150
They're twisting his words. They don't trust him.

257
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.350
They have zero confidence in him. They don't want him around. In fact,

258
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.750
there's recommending to the king that he be dead.

259
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.110
Look what he says All day long they injure my cause.

260
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.100
All their thoughts are against me for evil. They stir up strife,

261
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.300
they lurk, they watch my steps.

262
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.460
They have waited for my life all day long.

263
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.780
They distract David from God's purpose. And then he says they injure my cause.

264
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.260
I think this is David taking God's purs purpose personally.

265
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.390
Do you do that? Do you take God's purpose in your life personally?

266
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:06.790
Do you see temptation and sin as a way of harming God's purpose in your

267
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.950
life? Because evil harms God's calling.

268
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.310
That's evil thoughts and evil words and evil relationships.

269
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.350
Those are a threat to God's calling all day long.

270
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.710
They're plotting to harm me all day long.

271
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:24.110
Evil men are twisting my words all day long. They lurk in the shadows, needing,

272
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.070
needing to take me down all day long.

273
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.310
They're watching my every step waiting for me to stumble all day long.

274
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:34.110
They're eager to pounce and take my life. Folks, this isn't paranoia,

275
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.750
this isn't dilution.

276
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.870
David's trauma is real and painful and potentially devastating.

277
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.950
But then there's David's triumph. This is palms up in verses seven, eight,

278
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.870
and nine for their crime.

279
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.320
Will they escape in wrath? Cast down the people's. Oh God,

280
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.920
you have kept count of my tossings.

281
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.800
Now that's not a word that we use very often. I looked it up in the Hebrew.

282
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.040
It can mean wonderings. Some of your translations may say wonderings,

283
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.000
but tossings means wonderings or miseries or sorrows.

284
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.040
You put my tears in a bottle. Are they not in your book?

285
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.840
Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call this,

286
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.880
I know that God is for me. I just,

287
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.520
I don't know why I, this is a threat and you guys can make me look silly here,

288
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.600
but I just wanna try this. Okay, I'm gonna say this.

289
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.720
I know and you're gonna say that God is for me.

290
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.120
Don't say it like you don't mean it unless you don't.

291
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.880
You just sit there and let the conviction of the Holy Spirit take you down.

292
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.880
I'll do it with you the first time this I know that God is for me.

293
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.280
This, I know that God is for me. One more time.

294
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.440
This I know that God is for me.

295
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.840
We should be able to remember that we should let that,

296
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.920
that personalization of God's calling,

297
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.600
let let that be an attack against evil because we don't want to see that happen.

298
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.280
Because what David is pointing out here is first of all God's justice.

299
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:12.000
David plead him, pleaded, don't let them escape your divine justice.

300
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.800
He knows that these men are accountable to God.

301
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.280
He knows that their deeds are evil. He also knows God's view of sin. He is holy,

302
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.120
holy, holy. And his sin must be punished.

303
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.080
So if they're guilty of crime and cruelty,

304
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.080
then God will bring them down in guilty judgment.

305
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.680
But it's not all about God's justice, it's also about God's empathy.

306
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.400
David plainly states, this moves me,

307
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.440
that God makes record of our sorrows.

308
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.720
Saves your tears in a bottle.

309
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.600
God sees a David sees God's empathy wherever tear he shed in

310
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.680
the desert. List my tears in a book.

311
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.520
You know me and you care about me.

312
00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.440
David knew that God cared enough to record his tears.

313
00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.160
But then the ultimate triumph, it's this, I know that God is for me.

314
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.320
And this phrase reminds me of my favorite New Testament passage. In fact,

315
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.240
I can go back to 1982. Sorry, I know he is blo if you weren't born then, but uh,

316
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.120
I was uh,

317
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.400
a youth minister at this new church and they let me preach on a Wednesday night

318
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.080
cuz that's where we start the new guys. And so, uh,

319
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.800
I was preaching from this passage and I can remember reading this passage and I

320
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.920
can remember it overcoming me as I was reading it. And I can remember thinking,

321
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.680
this is what I want to pledge my life to. Romans 8 31,

322
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.960
what shall we say then in response to this? If God is for us,

323
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.200
who can be against us, who did not spare his own son,

324
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.560
but gave him up for us all,

325
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.400
how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?

326
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.200
Who shall bring charge against God's elect?

327
00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.200
It is God who justify who is it to condemn Christ?

328
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.160
Jesus is the one who died more than that, who is raised,

329
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.840
who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.

330
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.200
Who shall separate us from the levo Christ shall tribu tribulation or distress

331
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.240
or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword as it is written

332
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.560
for you are being killed all day long.

333
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.760
We are re regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. No,

334
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.880
no. In all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

335
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.200
For I am sure that neither death nor life nor angels or rulers or anything

336
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.280
present or things to come nor powers nor height, nor death,

337
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.080
nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of

338
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.000
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.

339
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.520
That's David's triumph. And this is David's thankfulness.

340
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.280
This psalm concludes with a,

341
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.160
a great psalm sung about his thankfulness. So this is palms up.

342
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.120
Remember, a refugee in enemy territory,

343
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.240
probably with saliva still wet in his beard,

344
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.160
speaks as if God has already answered his prayers.

345
00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.520
He finishes so strong with this declaration of praise in Thanksgiving,

346
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.600
God in his promises can be trusted. Look at verse 10,

347
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:24.000
in God whose word I praise in the Lord whose word

348
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.120
I praise in God, I trust I shall not be afraid. For what can man do to me?

349
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.360
I must perform my vows to you. Oh God, I will render thankful offerings to you.

350
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.360
For you have delivered my soul from death. Yes,

351
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.160
my feet from falling that I may walk before God In the light of life,

352
00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:47.440
David has prayed himself to a place of confidence by faith in

353
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.400
God's promises who cannot lie.

354
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.920
David places himself in a space of confidence.

355
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.640
His confidence is in God and in God's word.

356
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.440
And even though his deliverance is still in the future,

357
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.680
he's certain about it right now.

358
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.560
David knew that God would give him a throne in the very land

359
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:13.440
that he has exiled from. And if God is God, he cannot break his promises.

360
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.560
And he promised that during the worst terror and trauma

361
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.800
of David's life, he knows God won't break his promises.

362
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.560
He know that no man can undo God's promise and he knows that he can give thanks

363
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.160
for his future deliverance right now he's confidence that God is gonna deliver

364
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.880
him in the future. God is God.

365
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.040
He always keeps his promises and his design purposes

366
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.680
cannot be defeated.

367
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.640
Jesus is God's promised deliverer who triumphed over Satan through his death

368
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.400
barrel and resurrection. He is that offspring of the woman he restored,

369
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.960
humanity's broken relationship with God. Jesus is the good news.

370
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.160
This is the gospel. Do you know him?

371
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.620
Look at this verse chapter 56,

372
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.300
because Jesus is like David in Psalms 56.

373
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.220
He also lived as an exile under the jealous leadership of Jewish leaders.

374
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.660
They hated him. They slandered him, they pursued him.

375
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.180
And eventually they had him killed. Like David. Jesus was promised a throne,

376
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.580
but this throne would be at the right hand of God like David,

377
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.780
Jesus entrusts his tears and sufferings into God's hands like David.

378
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:34.820
Jesus entrusts his justice to bring deliverance and

379
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:39.420
because God is God and his promises are sure God turned Jesus suffering into

380
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.660
resurrection, victory. Do you know him?

381
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.020
But listen to this, we are also like David and Psalm 56,

382
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.020
we too are exiled and alone and slandered and victimized in terror

383
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.153
and trauma.

384
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.980
We too are caught in between a rock and a hard place in between terror and

385
00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.900
trauma and difficulty in danger.

386
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.140
We too have enemies that want to distract us from God's purpose.

387
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.940
We've gotta take that personally because they want to harm our calling,

388
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.660
our leadership as parents, our leadership as spouses,

389
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.780
our leadership in the church as we serve. But Jesus

390
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.300
is God's promise to us. And God always keeps his promises.

391
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.780
And because of Jesus,

392
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:28.660
God's perfect justice will be done on our behalf and God's promises will reign

393
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.140
with him forever. So I ask you,

394
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.740
I ask you if God is for us,

395
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.420
what can mere flesh do to us?

396
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.340
Because if Jesus' perfect sacrifice on the cross,

397
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.580
no condemnation or charge will come against us. Sin,

398
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.420
no sin is too big that it cannot be forgiven except the rejection of Jesus.

399
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.420
No enemy is too wicked that it cannot be brought to justice. Let me ask you,

400
00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.100
do you know him? Let's pray.

401
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.600
Father of these last few moments, I would pray, Lord God, that you would uh,

402
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.000
direct our hearts through the power of the Holy Spirit to come to you.

403
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.560
That we would pray ourselves to a place of confidence

404
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.560
that we would know Father, that you are God and you are in perfect control.

405
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.830
And it's in Jesus. Now my prays,

406
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.070
please just keep your heads bow for just a minute. And I'm,

407
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.790
and if you're not comfortable with this, then I,

408
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.870
I don't want you to do to do this, but, but you,

409
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.990
you might just try for a moment, this palms up and palms down method of prayer.

410
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.400
And we're gonna start with our palms down. So with your hands in your lap,

411
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.560
put them down. Now remember,

412
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.560
this is you surrendering your worries and your fears and your anxieties and

413
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.120
your distraction, any rebellion you have to God.

414
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.560
Now it's time to let go of these things.

415
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.870
So I just welcome you to pray silently and I'll just direct your thoughts.

416
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.790
Do you wanna be free from crippling fear?

417
00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.590
Do you feel crushed or run over or stepped on or stomped on?

418
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.260
In honesty,

419
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.320
can you express in prayer right now how you're feeling trampled and attacked?

420
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.960
How you're feeling fearful and anxious with your palms down?

421
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.320
Admit that to God And just give it away. Let it go.

422
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.680
Can you be as honest with God as David was about your weaknesses?

423
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.520
Have you been running the danger to find relief,

424
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.800
hidden behaviors, toxic relationships,

425
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.240
addiction? Just ask for forgiveness right now.

426
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.240
Verse John one, nine says, if we confess our sins,

427
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.200
he is faithful and Justin will forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all

428
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.033
unrighteousness.

429
00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.520
Tomorrow night we have celebrate recovery that meets us across the street or

430
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.353
just down the hallway.

431
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.960
And there they will meet you and they will agree with you that God is a God of

432
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.680
victory and they will walk with you through coming, overcoming that dependence.

433
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.960
Are you in a difficult conflict with someone and you don't know what to do and

434
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.040
people are twisting your words, waiting for you to fall? It's time to let,

435
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.160
let go of that bitterness.

436
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.920
Let your anger and your disappointment and your frustration let it go.

437
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.560
Are you experiencing suffering or sorrow? Surrender your fears.

438
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.440
Let that anxiety go. Your trauma is real and your pain can be devastating.

439
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.880
So just let loose of it right now. Give it to God.

440
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.680
Now If you don't mind,

441
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.640
just take a big deep breath and turn your hands over. It's time to receive,

442
00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.360
to receive God's grace, to receive his forgiveness, his mercy, his blessings.

443
00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.360
It's time to declare that God is God and he is faithful and reliable and able

444
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.400
and strong. And that nothing separates you from the love of Christ,

445
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.560
that you are more than conquerors through him who loved you.

446
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.560
Proclaim with certainty that God will accomplish his mission in the world and he

447
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.360
will use you as a faithful servant.

448
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.240
Praise him that he can be trusted because he keeps his promises and that he has

449
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.800
not abandoned you.

450
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.840
Praise God because Jesus' perfect justice will be done on your behalf.

451
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.740
Express

452
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.440
How thankful you are that God turned Jesus suffering into resurrection.

453
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.373
Vic victory.

454
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.160
No charge against you will stand no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus.

455
00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.560
No sin too big that cannot be forgiven. Do you know him?

456
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.480
Just rejoice in God's deliverance.

457
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.240
At the end of the service there will be people on the sides.

458
00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.280
And if you sense God is working in your heart right now,

459
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.560
that's the Holy Spirit saying you need to get this right and now is your

460
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.280
opportunity. They would be willing to pray with you, to hear your story,

461
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.360
to direct you to the right counsel. Father God,

462
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:14.723
thank you so much

463
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:16.920
For

464
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.753
Being you,

465
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.040
for taking on all my sins and my sorrows for remembering that I struggle.

466
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.133
But then Lord,

467
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:31.720
restoring me to a place where I could be used of you and called of you to

468
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.520
proclaim your gospel. Thank you that that's the story for all of us, Lord.

469
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:38.320
It's

470
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.960
In Jesus and we pray. Amen. Let's stand together.
