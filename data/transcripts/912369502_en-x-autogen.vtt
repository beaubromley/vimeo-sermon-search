WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
Alright, well thank you all for being here,

2
00:00:05.165 --> 00:00:08.205
handling the weather as well as this other distractions,

3
00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:11.245
which we will catch later on.

4
00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.965
So let me pray for us as we get started.

5
00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.445
Rather be with us tonight as we just continue to try to

6
00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:25.045
learn more from, uh, the instruction that you left us about

7
00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:28.645
how to treat each other, how to treat other people, how

8
00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.765
to treat our spouses, um,

9
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.285
and just so that we will experience as much of the joy

10
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.285
that you designed us for as possible.

11
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:41.845
And, um, thank you for everybody being here tonight

12
00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:45.205
and just the, uh, keep us all safe that we're

13
00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:47.405
having weather tonight.

14
00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.245
So we thank you in Jesus' name. Amen.

15
00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:55.125
Alright, so, um, tonight

16
00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:58.485
we are going to, as I've got up here on the board,

17
00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:02.085
and if you, if you saw the, if you were at the

18
00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:08.045
workshop we did, this will, without question go over some

19
00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:11.685
of the same material, but I have always believed repetition

20
00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:12.845
was not a bad thing.

21
00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:15.085
It's kinda like if you heard it the first time

22
00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:16.365
and it sounded interesting

23
00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.685
and it was maybe useful, that's great.

24
00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:22.645
But most of us don't change habits that quickly.

25
00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:24.885
You know, we don't hear something once

26
00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:28.485
and then it just totally floods our life in a way

27
00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:31.565
that we never act in old ways again.

28
00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:33.685
So I think

29
00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:36.485
We can attest to that After.

30
00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:38.445
Yeah. Are you gonna throw me under the bus again?

31
00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:41.645
30 years of doing this material,

32
00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:43.925
we still bump into stuff. That's

33
00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:45.065
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:47.565
Yeah. And if you think you have it down,

35
00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:50.445
then God takes you into a new season of life

36
00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:52.565
and changes things.

37
00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:57.805
Uh, Jimmy just sent us a message about the iPad.

38
00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:00.685
So sorry, Jimmy, I got that on the recording,

39
00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:04.805
but, uh, anyway, I'm not sure what it was,

40
00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:08.805
but I think he was just saying we,

41
00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:10.405
we put one in there.

42
00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:15.525
So, um, I'm gonna do a quick reference to last week,

43
00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:21.285
that focus last week, hello focus last week was how

44
00:02:22.065 --> 00:02:25.805
we are truly designed sovereignly by God,

45
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.525
such that when we come into this world, we created

46
00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:32.685
to connect, we're looking for someone who loves us,

47
00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:36.765
and that includes who, who delights in us.

48
00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:39.805
And if we don't have that,

49
00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:46.125
and yet our brain was pre-wired, hardwired to expect that,

50
00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:52.685
then we're gonna have to adjust how we deal with life,

51
00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:54.605
every little bit of it.

52
00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:59.605
And yet, we didn't come into this world with, uh, education

53
00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:03.645
and with all that knowledge we came in without any

54
00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.045
education, without the use of words.

55
00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:10.005
So we're, we're searching in the dark

56
00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:11.725
for what's this supposed to look like

57
00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:16.565
and what we are designed for was good

58
00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:18.525
and created by God.

59
00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:24.085
And that would be a family system where there's a mom

60
00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:28.925
and a dad and they each bring not only two

61
00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:32.805
different genders, they bring two different personalities.

62
00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:37.005
And yet, if they were living totally in obedience to God,

63
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.965
they're giving us what we need every single day.

64
00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.205
Garden of Eden, before the fall, just,

65
00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:44.525
Ima use your imagination.

66
00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:49.565
We'd all be acting right, thinking right, responding right.

67
00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:52.885
And that means those little kids would get all

68
00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:56.605
of the attention that they need and they'd be valued

69
00:03:56.745 --> 00:04:01.045
and comforted and, uh, it'd all be good.

70
00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:04.955
But I failed at that. I'm sorry,

71
00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:06.155
I failed at that. Well,

72
00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:08.075
once you say what, what you mean by that?

73
00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.955
I didn't do all those things with you.

74
00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:13.475
Oh, with our son? Yeah. Okay.

75
00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:16.155
I was picturing you as a little baby there for a second.

76
00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:20.155
Okay. Yeah. Nor did I far from it.

77
00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:23.995
Uh, he was in eighth grade from when we were introduced

78
00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:25.435
to these principals.

79
00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:27.315
Mm-Hmm. And

80
00:04:30.345 --> 00:04:31.465
I just failed at it.

81
00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:34.305
And I had to go, go back to him

82
00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:37.145
and ask for his apology or an apology.

83
00:04:38.055 --> 00:04:42.255
Yeah. I think he cuts you

84
00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:43.455
more slack than he did me.

85
00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:48.735
That's another story. But, uh, I, I, so

86
00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:53.575
one thing we find a lot is when we're teaching these

87
00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:56.615
principles for marriages, oftentimes people

88
00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:59.815
who are in the room already have kids

89
00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:02.615
who have grown quite a bit, or they're even adult kids.

90
00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:05.335
And sometimes they'll actually start kind

91
00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:06.415
of beating themselves up.

92
00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:08.295
Oh my gosh, what have we done?

93
00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:10.455
We didn't do any stuff like this.

94
00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:14.775
And we just reassure them that it never is too late

95
00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:20.095
to start making improvements in how we relate to people.

96
00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:22.735
It's never too late. That doesn't mean they'll

97
00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:24.055
respond the way we would hope they would.

98
00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:28.735
It just says we're all in a process of sanctification.

99
00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:30.175
This is just one of many areas.

100
00:05:30.355 --> 00:05:32.935
So just want to kind of normalize that a little bit.

101
00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:35.655
So join the club and we are too.

102
00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:41.495
So we talked about, um, how we were,

103
00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:43.455
we were, uh, created to connect.

104
00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:48.575
And one of the ways that we connect is we,

105
00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:52.495
um, connect on an emotional level,

106
00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.135
not just an intellectual level.

107
00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:58.165
Um, which looks like

108
00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:01.605
if I tell you something that happened to me,

109
00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:06.645
you don't just absorb the factual information

110
00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:10.325
without any movement in your heart.

111
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.725
If I share something good with you, you respond

112
00:06:14.115 --> 00:06:16.445
with some kind of rejoicing with me.

113
00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:19.205
If I share something negative with you

114
00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:23.245
or a sad thing with you, then you respond on that level.

115
00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:24.725
You meet me where I'm at.

116
00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:28.725
And I think last week I mentioned a verse, Romans 1215,

117
00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:30.845
very simple verse, very short verse,

118
00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:35.565
but a verse that's basically covering both of those bases.

119
00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:37.565
It says, rejoice with those who rejoice

120
00:06:38.905 --> 00:06:40.565
and mourn with those who mourn.

121
00:06:41.265 --> 00:06:44.045
So we're gonna practice that here for just a few seconds.

122
00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:48.485
Um, Brandon, if your, if your wife is not here,

123
00:06:48.705 --> 00:06:50.005
you get to share with Joyce.

124
00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:53.405
Yes. Would that be okay? Yes. You good with that? Yes, sir.

125
00:06:53.515 --> 00:06:57.045
Okay. So rejoice with those who rejoice

126
00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:00.285
would be, I'm excited for you.

127
00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:02.565
That sounds really good. I'm glad that happened for you.

128
00:07:03.745 --> 00:07:07.525
Um, mourn with those who, tell me more and tell me more.

129
00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:10.285
Yeah. And mourn with those

130
00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:13.485
who mourn would be, that sounds hard.

131
00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:16.685
That sounds bad. Sorry that happened to you.

132
00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:21.005
Instead of pep talks changing the

133
00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:23.125
subject, that kind of thing.

134
00:07:24.025 --> 00:07:25.925
So I want you to practice Romans 1215

135
00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:27.845
for just a couple of minutes here.

136
00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:31.605
Okay. Such that maybe, uh, Bernie,

137
00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:34.445
you would share something good that happened to you

138
00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:39.005
this week with Angie and she would rejoice with you.

139
00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:42.485
Now if we start seeing the two of you jumping up

140
00:07:42.485 --> 00:07:44.645
and doing high fives, that's okay.

141
00:07:45.435 --> 00:07:48.645
That'll be okay. If we're teaching this to teenagers,

142
00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:50.205
that's the way it happens.

143
00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:54.485
Okay. They get into it, um,

144
00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:56.645
except when they're embarrassed to get into it.

145
00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:59.565
But that's another thing. Um, and,

146
00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:03.285
and then you invite her to share what's something good

147
00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:06.645
to happen to you this week and do the same thing.

148
00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:11.495
And then let's go ahead and do the second part also.

149
00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:14.615
What was something that was difficult for you this week?

150
00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:17.175
Now, I, I'm actually suggesting this is not the time

151
00:08:17.175 --> 00:08:20.015
to bring up a argument between you or something like that.

152
00:08:20.665 --> 00:08:22.095
Stick with stuff that's external

153
00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:23.975
to your relationship for today.

154
00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:26.615
We'll get to that stuff in about week six

155
00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:28.335
or five, somewhere in there.

156
00:08:28.805 --> 00:08:30.535
Okay. So go ahead and take turns.

157
00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:32.255
She, and I'll give you a little warning

158
00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:33.695
before we, we sharing something good,

159
00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:35.415
Something Positive, something good.

160
00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:40.415
And then after you each share something good, then, uh, say,

161
00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:43.015
well, tell me something that was difficult for you this week

162
00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:46.055
or left you sad, or something like that.

163
00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.325
Okay.

164
00:08:59.355 --> 00:09:04.165
Okay. How about you? Pretty, she has,

165
00:09:04.305 --> 00:09:05.565
She has to share all songs.

166
00:09:06.285 --> 00:09:08.125
I thought we just said. Okay.

167
00:09:08.705 --> 00:09:10.045
So just making, making sure

168
00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:14.605
you first

169
00:09:16.845 --> 00:09:18.765
Rejoice wise, Uh,

170
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.885
I got an opportunity to Referee

171
00:09:26.055 --> 00:09:27.055
Basketball game.

172
00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:34.725
It was, uh, it was actually a bucket.

173
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:37.325
I said it was actually a bucket.

174
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.525
So to get the train out.

175
00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:48.085
Oh great. So my daughter used to play,

176
00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:49.845
but she currently plays volley.

177
00:09:50.865 --> 00:09:52.885
Uh, The basketball referee

178
00:09:53.045 --> 00:09:56.165
Training route Was a precursor to try to get into the

179
00:09:56.165 --> 00:09:57.165
Basketball training.

180
00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.405
And so that's good for you.

181
00:10:03.485 --> 00:10:07.525
I did actually, I did five training, got a certification.

182
00:10:08.185 --> 00:10:09.285
So after the certification,

183
00:10:12.105 --> 00:10:13.105
It was exciting. You did

184
00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:13.825
it after five.

185
00:10:28.805 --> 00:10:30.845
I had to, I traveled before

186
00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:34.885
and so my daughter was not feeling the best

187
00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:36.365
on the day that I had to leave.

188
00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:38.005
And it's always joke,

189
00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:40.605
but it's kind of like seeing the reason why I go is

190
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:42.005
to make sure, you know,

191
00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:46.685
they like leave

192
00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:50.685
Was Kind like she was already down.

193
00:10:56.885 --> 00:10:57.965
I work for a medical device.

194
00:11:02.315 --> 00:11:04.925
Like When a physician buys I technology,

195
00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:07.885
I use it.

196
00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:21.445
I have $3

197
00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:35.995
Emotion.

198
00:11:38.425 --> 00:11:39.325
My youngest in my

199
00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:44.765
are is kind.

200
00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:46.845
I think it bothers her,

201
00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:51.245
but she's more, as long as you talk to

202
00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:55.395
Yeah. And the mothers

203
00:11:55.395 --> 00:11:56.205
who need To,

204
00:11:57.465 --> 00:11:58.845
We got the whole field

205
00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:05.765
usually about three.

206
00:12:18.285 --> 00:12:19.805
I first gotta prepare myself

207
00:12:21.665 --> 00:12:26.565
and honestly, sometimes I don't just kind, I prepare myself

208
00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:31.085
About another minute or two.

209
00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:44.085
And that's the goal. I mean, the goal

210
00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:46.565
to do this bill, and that's part of

211
00:12:48.715 --> 00:12:52.285
Referee Being in school at the same

212
00:12:52.285 --> 00:12:53.885
Time is Quite a

213
00:13:48.905 --> 00:13:49.905
Did they find out?

214
00:14:02.705 --> 00:14:05.285
Oh yeah. That's the sad that n***a

215
00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:30.585
You have to go through.

216
00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:34.445
Okay. Uh,

217
00:14:36.745 --> 00:14:38.085
I'm, I'm digging around here

218
00:14:38.205 --> 00:14:41.805
'cause I've gotta get to a, uh, website.

219
00:14:41.805 --> 00:14:43.725
There it is right there. Okay.

220
00:14:45.535 --> 00:14:46.885
We're gonna be using this one.

221
00:14:48.425 --> 00:14:51.725
Um, that process, simple

222
00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:57.645
structured whatever, um, would improve probably half

223
00:14:57.645 --> 00:14:59.485
of the marriages out there in the world if they

224
00:14:59.485 --> 00:15:00.605
did it on a regular basis.

225
00:15:01.505 --> 00:15:02.765
That's a pretty broad statement

226
00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:04.125
for anybody, but I really believe it.

227
00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:07.565
We just get so caught up in what's normal

228
00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:10.965
and, uh, we deal with what has to be done.

229
00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:12.725
We deal with conflicts that arise,

230
00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:16.925
but so often we're just not checking in kind

231
00:15:16.925 --> 00:15:18.165
of heart to heart like that.

232
00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:22.725
So it's a great discipline to develop and it's biblical.

233
00:15:23.275 --> 00:15:26.405
It's actually part of the biblical commands about

234
00:15:26.505 --> 00:15:28.525
how we're supposed to relate to one another.

235
00:15:30.025 --> 00:15:33.725
But there's lots of things that have gotten me in our way

236
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:34.925
of doing that naturally.

237
00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:38.925
Usually it is if I opened up

238
00:15:38.925 --> 00:15:40.045
and shared something with someone,

239
00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:43.805
they didn't give me a response that was attuned to

240
00:15:43.805 --> 00:15:45.605
what I'm feeling.

241
00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:49.405
I was saying I was sad. And they said, get happy.

242
00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:54.165
You know, don't let that bother you.

243
00:15:55.425 --> 00:15:57.245
You're making a mountain out of a mobile hill.

244
00:15:57.425 --> 00:16:00.765
All of those responses will tend to shut us down.

245
00:16:02.785 --> 00:16:06.165
And so we have to learn, uh, what to avoid

246
00:16:06.985 --> 00:16:11.365
and, uh, in order to keep it safe for us

247
00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:14.925
to communicate your brain.

248
00:16:15.465 --> 00:16:20.125
Um, my brain all have, uh,

249
00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:25.285
particular kinds of neurons, um, that are set up to try

250
00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:27.085
to read someone else's mind.

251
00:16:27.835 --> 00:16:30.485
They can't do it, but they're trying to.

252
00:16:30.635 --> 00:16:33.165
Does that make sense? They're trying to discern,

253
00:16:33.465 --> 00:16:34.685
are you in a good mood?

254
00:16:35.225 --> 00:16:36.685
Is it okay for me to share?

255
00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:40.085
Will you join me if I'm excited about something?

256
00:16:40.085 --> 00:16:41.965
Will you take part in that?

257
00:16:42.185 --> 00:16:44.765
Or will you have your feelings hurt if I do?

258
00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:48.365
All those kinds of things there, there's wiring up there

259
00:16:48.365 --> 00:16:51.325
that's designed to try to make that work.

260
00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:57.085
But if you get burned, it's only natural that another part

261
00:16:57.085 --> 00:16:58.405
of your brain's gonna say, look out.

262
00:16:58.955 --> 00:17:02.045
Plus don't do that. Plus don't go there. Okay.

263
00:17:02.665 --> 00:17:05.365
So what we wanna do is always create a safe environment

264
00:17:05.365 --> 00:17:06.565
that says, I will listen.

265
00:17:06.805 --> 00:17:08.885
I won't be watching TV out the corner of my eyes.

266
00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:11.845
Sorry guys. If I step on anybody's toes,

267
00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:16.325
but they're my toes as much as anybody's, I'm gonna tune in.

268
00:17:17.825 --> 00:17:21.245
So we talked about the still face video as a kind of visual

269
00:17:21.465 --> 00:17:24.965
for what's, what, what do we see that would kind of show up

270
00:17:25.025 --> 00:17:28.525
as that's, that's evidence of there being such wiring.

271
00:17:29.345 --> 00:17:33.565
Um, what did you notice about that video? Anything?

272
00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:35.965
Do you remember anything about that that kind

273
00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:37.005
of stood out to you?

274
00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:41.205
Just major takeaways from seeing that little girl

275
00:17:41.345 --> 00:17:44.845
and her mom interacting and then the mom going silent.

276
00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:50.405
Remember how it didn't take long

277
00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:52.525
for the little girl to react?

278
00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:57.325
And at first she wasn't bent outta shape, she was just kind

279
00:17:57.325 --> 00:18:00.125
of, Hmm, what's this I talking?

280
00:18:00.505 --> 00:18:04.125
What's the deal? But it didn't take more than two minutes

281
00:18:04.665 --> 00:18:09.365
for her to go from that to kind of having a meltdown.

282
00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:12.365
Distress. Distress. Yeah.

283
00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:16.165
And we said it was properly labeled distress.

284
00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:20.365
Not this 1-year-old doesn't know how

285
00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:24.165
to be in a mature 1-year-old yet it's not about that.

286
00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:28.245
It's all about wiring in the brain that says

287
00:18:29.705 --> 00:18:32.205
we are not secure like we were secure.

288
00:18:32.385 --> 00:18:36.805
The goal is a secure attachment that we protect

289
00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:39.645
and guard and maintain over time.

290
00:18:40.115 --> 00:18:41.645
Whether we're talking about children

291
00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:46.415
or adults, they gotta maintain that secure attachment.

292
00:18:46.555 --> 00:18:47.655
And if I violate

293
00:18:48.035 --> 00:18:50.895
or hurt that secure attachment, then I've gotta work.

294
00:18:51.355 --> 00:18:53.455
If I'm doing the right thing, I've gotta work to try

295
00:18:53.455 --> 00:18:58.255
to restore whatever I have hurt in Joyce and vice versa.

296
00:18:59.715 --> 00:19:01.735
That's, that's why we were looking at that.

297
00:19:03.715 --> 00:19:07.095
That's part of who we are wired by God according

298
00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:08.335
to his system.

299
00:19:09.035 --> 00:19:11.095
One little scientific thing I'm gonna throw in here.

300
00:19:11.955 --> 00:19:14.455
The nervous system. I'm definitely not a medical doctor,

301
00:19:15.515 --> 00:19:18.295
but the nervous system has two pieces basically.

302
00:19:18.585 --> 00:19:21.135
One's called the sympathetic nervous system.

303
00:19:21.225 --> 00:19:22.855
One's called the parasympathetic.

304
00:19:23.565 --> 00:19:25.415
Help me out here if you can, if I need it.

305
00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:29.215
So the sympathetic is the one that fires up

306
00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:32.615
and ramps you up, okay?

307
00:19:32.615 --> 00:19:34.255
It gets your adrenaline flowing.

308
00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:36.695
It might involve your fight or flight mechanism.

309
00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:41.815
And that's part of god's, uh, fearfully

310
00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:45.615
and wonderfully made body that says, if you're threatened,

311
00:19:46.425 --> 00:19:49.295
we've got equipment that doesn't even require you to think

312
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.535
you'll be pumped up with adrenaline

313
00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:55.335
in milliseconds 12 to be exact.

314
00:19:55.885 --> 00:19:59.215
Okay? But what if you

315
00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:05.295
had a big, um, emotional

316
00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:09.975
flood because you thought you were about

317
00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:12.295
to step on a copperhead in your yard

318
00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:15.695
and it turned out to be that stick that fell off of the tree

319
00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:19.345
Just when you first saw it outta the corner of your eye,

320
00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:22.585
you thought, and you actually didn't have

321
00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:23.825
to form a thought before.

322
00:20:24.205 --> 00:20:25.985
If you'd ever seen a copperhead before

323
00:20:26.085 --> 00:20:27.465
or another kind of snake,

324
00:20:27.775 --> 00:20:29.585
your brain would've said close enough.

325
00:20:30.035 --> 00:20:31.985
We're assuming it's a copperhead.

326
00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:36.585
Flood the body with adrenaline and do it quickly

327
00:20:36.585 --> 00:20:39.105
because there's no time to think.

328
00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:42.545
So you might jump before you even figure out why you jumped.

329
00:20:42.655 --> 00:20:44.945
Does that make sense? Now,

330
00:20:44.945 --> 00:20:47.645
that's your sympathetic nervous system doing its job

331
00:20:48.305 --> 00:20:49.365
trying to protect you.

332
00:20:51.865 --> 00:20:55.365
But what if your dad was a copperhead?

333
00:20:58.635 --> 00:21:02.325
Meaning what if he yelled at you every time he talked to you

334
00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:04.885
or something like that?

335
00:21:06.115 --> 00:21:09.085
What if he, uh, just flew off the handle

336
00:21:11.425 --> 00:21:13.205
or all kinds of symptoms like that?

337
00:21:14.425 --> 00:21:17.085
And if you grew up with a whole lot of conditioning like

338
00:21:17.085 --> 00:21:18.925
that, or you got it from kids at school

339
00:21:19.225 --> 00:21:21.245
or whatever it might have been, if you had a lot

340
00:21:21.245 --> 00:21:23.725
of unsafe interactions with people,

341
00:21:25.635 --> 00:21:29.845
then your brain is going to exercise that

342
00:21:31.095 --> 00:21:34.205
triggering of your nervous system

343
00:21:35.225 --> 00:21:36.965
at times when you didn't need it at all.

344
00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.925
And that's just putting you through a whole bunch of stress

345
00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:44.975
that you didn't need because that part of the brain

346
00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:47.295
that does that triggering, that gets

347
00:21:47.295 --> 00:21:51.655
that sympathetic nervous system going, it cannot think

348
00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:55.455
that part of the brain doesn't think it just switches on

349
00:21:55.455 --> 00:21:58.055
and off once it switches on.

350
00:21:58.055 --> 00:22:00.855
It takes about 20 or 30 minutes for it to settle down

351
00:22:01.275 --> 00:22:03.175
as long as there's no additional threat.

352
00:22:04.355 --> 00:22:06.095
That's all you ever wanted to know about that.

353
00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:09.015
I'm sure the parasympathetic nervous system

354
00:22:09.035 --> 00:22:10.175
is the one that calms it down.

355
00:22:13.795 --> 00:22:14.815
And that's good because

356
00:22:14.815 --> 00:22:16.895
otherwise you would stay in that state

357
00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:20.095
Until you run out of energy.

358
00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:22.255
Can that be done by a person?

359
00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:24.175
Can it be what Done by a

360
00:22:24.175 --> 00:22:25.175
Person? Can the

361
00:22:25.175 --> 00:22:27.735
parasympathetic nervous system be done by a person?

362
00:22:27.735 --> 00:22:30.255
Mm-Hmm. Uh, she is so good.

363
00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:33.055
Just a great straight person for me.

364
00:22:33.805 --> 00:22:35.895
There's a process called co-regulation

365
00:22:36.045 --> 00:22:37.255
that says we can help.

366
00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:40.295
We can't switch it on and off.

367
00:22:40.295 --> 00:22:43.695
There's no literal switch, but we can help.

368
00:22:43.755 --> 00:22:46.495
And we help by creating a safe environment

369
00:22:46.835 --> 00:22:48.855
And removing, removing your longness.

370
00:22:49.405 --> 00:22:51.335
That would include removing a longness

371
00:22:51.335 --> 00:22:53.895
because in order to create a safe environment, I've got

372
00:22:53.895 --> 00:22:55.655
to at first notice that they're even upset.

373
00:22:56.445 --> 00:22:57.775
Does that make sense? Mm-Hmm.

374
00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:01.455
I've got a, my mirror neurons have to kind of figure out,

375
00:23:01.475 --> 00:23:03.215
oh, that, that look on her face.

376
00:23:03.275 --> 00:23:05.735
She looks like she has got some bad news.

377
00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:10.455
And that could even be causing her parasympathetic

378
00:23:10.475 --> 00:23:12.455
or her sympathetic nervous system to get involved.

379
00:23:14.115 --> 00:23:16.375
It may or may not be a ramp up in that case,

380
00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.095
but it's involved.

381
00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:23.095
And if I notice, that can be very helpful if I respond

382
00:23:24.345 --> 00:23:27.215
where she's at and in a gentle, loving way,

383
00:23:28.065 --> 00:23:29.415
honey, I sense that you're upset.

384
00:23:29.455 --> 00:23:31.015
I want you to know I care what's going on.

385
00:23:32.045 --> 00:23:36.825
Help me understand. That's a whole lot better

386
00:23:36.855 --> 00:23:39.705
than if somebody comes to you and says, calm down.

387
00:23:41.365 --> 00:23:43.865
Do you get that? That will not cause that,

388
00:23:44.255 --> 00:23:45.845
that will cause you to suppress

389
00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:48.525
and control your emotions if you can.

390
00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:52.845
But it will not start your nervous system relaxing.

391
00:23:53.825 --> 00:23:57.925
So that's all about removing aloneness, coming alongside,

392
00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:02.045
realizing that when someone gets triggered,

393
00:24:05.275 --> 00:24:10.215
the best they can do to have to, to

394
00:24:11.465 --> 00:24:13.885
not be a problem for you is if they just stuff it.

395
00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:16.405
But that's not gonna be good enough in the long run.

396
00:24:16.505 --> 00:24:19.365
We want to be present with each other, learning how

397
00:24:19.365 --> 00:24:20.525
to be safe for each other.

398
00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:23.245
If you're like us, you will never

399
00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:24.645
succeed a hundred percent of the time.

400
00:24:24.705 --> 00:24:26.885
But you definitely want to get to consistency

401
00:24:27.315 --> 00:24:30.845
because that's what changes the level of reaction

402
00:24:31.705 --> 00:24:34.965
is when I can know nine times outta 10, if not more,

403
00:24:35.155 --> 00:24:39.685
he's going to approach me in a calm manner when I'm not,

404
00:24:40.155 --> 00:24:41.165
when I'm upset.

405
00:24:43.155 --> 00:24:48.085
Okay, tonight we're gonna look at something that's not,

406
00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:54.005
um, limited to just being present with each other.

407
00:24:54.195 --> 00:24:56.045
It's how am I actually gonna start working

408
00:24:56.045 --> 00:24:57.325
on caring for you?

409
00:24:58.985 --> 00:25:00.645
How can I be more specific

410
00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:05.445
and targeted in how to care for Joyce in ways

411
00:25:05.475 --> 00:25:07.165
that may not be what I need?

412
00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:12.065
So she may have things that matter more to her in terms

413
00:25:12.065 --> 00:25:13.945
of relationships than I do.

414
00:25:14.845 --> 00:25:17.785
So I want to be able to understand what are those, so

415
00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:20.545
that I don't go around giving her what I need.

416
00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:24.095
That's how we sometimes do it. Okay?

417
00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:27.655
So we're gonna look at these 10 relational needs tonight.

418
00:25:28.795 --> 00:25:33.135
And they are all part of God's plan for us to live life.

419
00:25:33.795 --> 00:25:37.655
Interdependently not independently.

420
00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:44.295
I can remember growing up thinking again in a home.

421
00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:48.015
I think I've described as very stable, very safe overall,

422
00:25:48.445 --> 00:25:50.535
just not emotionally very connected.

423
00:25:51.195 --> 00:25:53.895
Not doing this kind of empathy and compassion stuff.

424
00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:56.015
Not because they didn't love us, but

425
00:25:56.015 --> 00:25:58.095
because they didn't understand it, didn't know it,

426
00:25:58.095 --> 00:25:59.575
didn't think it would, would help.

427
00:26:00.395 --> 00:26:02.135
So they didn't do that. Okay?

428
00:26:02.195 --> 00:26:03.855
So if we're hurting, we're hurting alone

429
00:26:04.235 --> 00:26:07.855
or we're being told get up and go get busy.

430
00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:12.615
Quit sitting around. Stuff like that when you're hurting.

431
00:26:14.595 --> 00:26:15.975
So as part of God's plan

432
00:26:17.675 --> 00:26:22.575
and um, we talked about the definition

433
00:26:22.575 --> 00:26:26.815
of intimacy last week, we talked about that meaning mutual

434
00:26:28.645 --> 00:26:33.455
deep knowing for the purpose of caring and involvement.

435
00:26:34.435 --> 00:26:35.895
Mutual means both of us.

436
00:26:36.205 --> 00:26:38.335
That means it's happening both ways.

437
00:26:38.545 --> 00:26:40.535
Joyce is coming to know me more deeply.

438
00:26:40.715 --> 00:26:43.365
I'm coming to know her more deeply for the purpose

439
00:26:43.545 --> 00:26:45.365
of caring for each other.

440
00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:50.045
The reason for me to know her more deeply includes so

441
00:26:50.045 --> 00:26:52.725
that I can better care for her when she needs care.

442
00:26:53.715 --> 00:26:58.405
Okay. How do you feel personally

443
00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:03.845
if I were to refer to you as being needy?

444
00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:11.445
Offended? What'd you say? Offended. Yeah.

445
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:13.285
Offended Angie. Yeah.

446
00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:17.805
Somebody else that's, appreciate that answer by the way.

447
00:27:17.995 --> 00:27:22.965
Weak. Weak. Can you ask the question again? How do you feel?

448
00:27:23.345 --> 00:27:27.885
How would you feel if I referred to you personally as needy?

449
00:27:28.485 --> 00:27:32.525
I just said that this this guy. I know he's needy.

450
00:27:34.345 --> 00:27:36.725
I'd think you're crazy. You'd think I'm crazy.

451
00:27:37.025 --> 00:27:38.765
Mm-Hmm. Okay. Because

452
00:27:38.985 --> 00:27:39.985
I'm not Needy.

453
00:27:40.395 --> 00:27:41.845
Okay, cool.

454
00:27:44.005 --> 00:27:48.335
Anybody else got some good vulnerable answers going on here?

455
00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:52.055
Well, what if I said, I think God says you are.

456
00:27:54.915 --> 00:27:58.495
Now I'm going to mess with you. Right? Okay.

457
00:27:59.675 --> 00:28:01.655
Now you wouldn't argue, no,

458
00:28:01.935 --> 00:28:06.615
I don't think anybody would argue that God made us

459
00:28:07.685 --> 00:28:11.415
needing air, water, food, rest.

460
00:28:12.215 --> 00:28:16.255
Occasionally those things we, we just accept.

461
00:28:16.555 --> 00:28:18.135
Of course we need those things, right?

462
00:28:18.235 --> 00:28:20.295
But I'm saying he didn't have to make you that way.

463
00:28:21.315 --> 00:28:22.655
He just did make you that way.

464
00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:27.895
Um, he could have wired you such

465
00:28:27.895 --> 00:28:29.575
that you didn't have any spiritual needs.

466
00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:33.535
Like You wouldn't need God. You'd be okay.

467
00:28:33.535 --> 00:28:35.855
You could just turn us loose down here and leave us be.

468
00:28:38.435 --> 00:28:40.455
But when it comes to these relational needs,

469
00:28:40.455 --> 00:28:44.175
and if I use that word need be, it usually conveys

470
00:28:44.175 --> 00:28:47.095
as I think Angie, you probably were hearing it through

471
00:28:47.095 --> 00:28:49.975
that lens that says, you're saying, I'm not enough,

472
00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.015
but there's something wrong with me.

473
00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:53.495
Someone else said I'm weak.

474
00:28:55.595 --> 00:28:59.615
And I'd say that's a cultural definition

475
00:29:00.675 --> 00:29:01.935
that's very prevalent.

476
00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:04.895
It was the one used in my home growing up

477
00:29:04.995 --> 00:29:06.735
by good people who loved their kids.

478
00:29:08.985 --> 00:29:11.215
There was an a sense that

479
00:29:14.005 --> 00:29:16.585
the only appropriate way to respond

480
00:29:16.725 --> 00:29:19.305
to adversity is to be strong.

481
00:29:21.395 --> 00:29:25.335
I'd say to you, there are so many times when we do need

482
00:29:25.335 --> 00:29:29.175
to respond by being strong to adversity in order to survive

483
00:29:30.555 --> 00:29:33.655
or to overcome an adverse situation.

484
00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:39.335
But if that means I cannot stop And cry

485
00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:44.365
afterwards, have have kind of a release

486
00:29:44.465 --> 00:29:47.085
of the pen up emotion that stressed me out,

487
00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:50.125
I'd say now we've gone too far.

488
00:29:50.295 --> 00:29:53.885
We've violated some scripture that says, oh no, mourn

489
00:29:53.885 --> 00:29:56.525
with those who mourn, cry with those who cry, weep

490
00:29:56.525 --> 00:29:59.405
with those who weep, which implies from God.

491
00:30:00.115 --> 00:30:01.525
It's not wrong to do that.

492
00:30:01.865 --> 00:30:03.725
I'm actually ordering you to do it.

493
00:30:06.585 --> 00:30:08.805
One of the best examples I can think of this as to

494
00:30:08.825 --> 00:30:12.005
how does this kind of blend as we go through life, was

495
00:30:12.525 --> 00:30:15.445
a guy named Charles Thornton down in, uh, Eli, Texas,

496
00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:18.365
where we were on the staff together at a church.

497
00:30:18.825 --> 00:30:20.365
And Charles was an evangelist.

498
00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:25.245
And I mean, he was a really, really, really well equipped

499
00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:26.605
and motivated evangelist.

500
00:30:26.635 --> 00:30:27.925
Just really good at what he did.

501
00:30:27.935 --> 00:30:30.125
Loved people, but he also had a real

502
00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:31.205
heart for sharing the gospel.

503
00:30:31.345 --> 00:30:34.445
And he did that so well trained,

504
00:30:34.795 --> 00:30:37.005
trained us in courses and all that kind of stuff.

505
00:30:38.275 --> 00:30:41.765
Charles was at the, uh, crash of an airliner

506
00:30:41.765 --> 00:30:46.725
that crashed at DFW Airport way back in the eight, uh,

507
00:30:47.165 --> 00:30:49.525
1980s, I believe, early 1980s.

508
00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:52.125
Was that the wind shear? I believe it

509
00:30:52.125 --> 00:30:53.165
was wind shear that caused it.

510
00:30:53.325 --> 00:30:55.325
I I thought you were gonna ask me. I think it was a delta

511
00:30:55.655 --> 00:30:57.045
pilot, uh, delta plant.

512
00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:59.205
I don't remember exactly, but it was a liner

513
00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:00.605
crash, killed a lot of people.

514
00:31:00.605 --> 00:31:03.965
Mm-Hmm. That church was located right next to that airport.

515
00:31:04.025 --> 00:31:07.005
So he, as soon as he heard about it, he hopped in his car

516
00:31:07.025 --> 00:31:09.645
and he was going to go and be a do chaplain kinds

517
00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:11.205
of things, trying to help people.

518
00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:13.765
And he said that, uh,

519
00:31:14.195 --> 00:31:16.365
when all the first responders were there

520
00:31:16.425 --> 00:31:18.525
and we're out there on the tarmac and,

521
00:31:19.145 --> 00:31:23.565
and I'm basically looking for people who, um, don't need me

522
00:31:23.565 --> 00:31:25.045
to physically care for them,

523
00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:27.885
but might, might be shaken and so forth.

524
00:31:27.945 --> 00:31:29.805
He said, I'm just trying to be helpful like that.

525
00:31:30.705 --> 00:31:32.525
And he said it was so intense.

526
00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:36.605
And he said it was so involved there

527
00:31:36.705 --> 00:31:38.045
for, for a couple of hours.

528
00:31:38.745 --> 00:31:41.925
And then they brought the first responders back into a room

529
00:31:41.985 --> 00:31:44.605
at the terminal and fed, fed them sandwiches

530
00:31:44.605 --> 00:31:45.765
and gave them something to drink

531
00:31:45.825 --> 00:31:50.485
and just kind of had a depression de uh, decompression time.

532
00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:54.285
And he said I was just fine

533
00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:57.565
during the two hours of being involved.

534
00:31:57.785 --> 00:32:01.205
But he said, when I sat down and started to eat a sandwich

535
00:32:01.265 --> 00:32:05.085
and drink some water, he said, my knees started to shake.

536
00:32:05.205 --> 00:32:07.925
I had a physical reaction to the stress

537
00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:09.845
that I had just experienced.

538
00:32:11.715 --> 00:32:13.925
Involuntary physical reaction

539
00:32:15.675 --> 00:32:18.685
that is saying we have a certain amount of capacity

540
00:32:18.785 --> 00:32:22.205
to be strong, even in a

541
00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:24.085
highly stressful situation.

542
00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:27.965
Not sure everybody has the same amount of ability,

543
00:32:28.145 --> 00:32:31.325
but we have some ability, some capacity

544
00:32:31.425 --> 00:32:32.925
to compartmentalize stuff.

545
00:32:34.025 --> 00:32:35.845
But you don't wanna live that way your whole life

546
00:32:35.945 --> 00:32:38.925
or you, you miss out on the joy

547
00:32:40.695 --> 00:32:42.915
as well as the pain.

548
00:32:45.335 --> 00:32:49.035
You're actually wired to decompress

549
00:32:49.295 --> 00:32:50.515
and it's best done.

550
00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.395
If someone, as Joyce was saying,

551
00:32:52.395 --> 00:32:53.475
could someone help with that?

552
00:32:53.475 --> 00:32:55.235
And I say, yeah, it's called co-regulation.

553
00:32:55.235 --> 00:32:58.115
It's when someone else comes up to you, puts her arm

554
00:32:58.115 --> 00:32:59.475
around you and says, it'll be okay.

555
00:33:00.255 --> 00:33:03.515
Hey, I got this. You're just having a reaction right now.

556
00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:07.075
You're going to be okay. I care about you.

557
00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:08.915
We're gonna take care of you.

558
00:33:10.185 --> 00:33:14.045
Okay, thoughts on that reactions?

559
00:33:14.945 --> 00:33:17.405
Bernie, you feeling better about that? Oh yeah. Okay.

560
00:33:17.565 --> 00:33:22.405
I guess we ask that question a lot when we teach this

561
00:33:22.405 --> 00:33:26.325
because we know a high number of people will have grown up

562
00:33:26.385 --> 00:33:28.285
or maybe even lived much of their life

563
00:33:29.475 --> 00:33:33.605
feeling almost guilty if they're feeling needy.

564
00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:36.485
And we're saying, don't do that to yourself.

565
00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.525
It's one thing if you've got somebody who's just always

566
00:33:40.525 --> 00:33:43.845
talking about their issues, that is a different animal.

567
00:33:44.565 --> 00:33:46.165
I mean, that's a different situation.

568
00:33:46.865 --> 00:33:51.245
I'm just talking about. Uh, when you experience a, a tragedy

569
00:33:51.465 --> 00:33:56.125
or even just a normal setback, it is not wrong to feel

570
00:33:56.645 --> 00:33:59.245
frustrated, anxious, worried, whatever.

571
00:34:00.065 --> 00:34:02.325
We just want to give you the tools for.

572
00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:03.605
What do you do with that and

573
00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:05.565
how can you help each other with that?

574
00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:11.085
So co-regulation says, not only am I trying to think

575
00:34:11.645 --> 00:34:14.285
positive thoughts, take my thoughts captive.

576
00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:16.045
They sound like bible verses by the way.

577
00:34:17.025 --> 00:34:21.285
I'm not only trying to do, do some healthy thinking, think

578
00:34:21.285 --> 00:34:25.085
of my options and process things on my own to try

579
00:34:25.085 --> 00:34:28.165
to calm myself down to where I can function well.

580
00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:30.805
But if she comes up and says, I can see you're really,

581
00:34:31.385 --> 00:34:33.085
you're really thinking hard right now.

582
00:34:33.185 --> 00:34:35.205
Is is there anything I can do to help?

583
00:34:35.915 --> 00:34:39.605
That alone helps. Okay.

584
00:34:41.505 --> 00:34:43.605
So we're, we're created for that.

585
00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:47.525
These 10 relational needs are specific ways that God said,

586
00:34:47.945 --> 00:34:51.085
you're going to need these things.

587
00:34:51.505 --> 00:34:53.165
And although you may have been taught

588
00:34:53.165 --> 00:34:55.325
that you shouldn't need them, we're just saying,

589
00:34:55.345 --> 00:34:57.085
if God says you need 'em, you need them.

590
00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.445
Okay, how do I know you need 'em?

591
00:34:59.605 --> 00:35:01.525
'cause he's instructing people to give them

592
00:35:02.315 --> 00:35:03.605
without limitation.

593
00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:07.005
He doesn't say, well, just give them to the young kids.

594
00:35:08.635 --> 00:35:10.125
Just comfort the young kids.

595
00:35:10.385 --> 00:35:12.125
No, the scripture doesn't say that.

596
00:35:13.905 --> 00:35:15.845
And it doesn't say, well, you know, the women,

597
00:35:15.845 --> 00:35:17.125
they're the weaker vessels.

598
00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:18.525
You know, they need it.

599
00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:20.885
No, it doesn't distinguish between men

600
00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.405
and women on these 10 needs.

601
00:35:23.275 --> 00:35:27.965
Therefore, everybody, regardless of nationality, race,

602
00:35:28.305 --> 00:35:30.605
gender, these are for everybody.

603
00:35:32.235 --> 00:35:34.725
Okay? That everybody has a story about

604
00:35:34.865 --> 00:35:36.805
how were your needs met when you were growing up.

605
00:35:39.745 --> 00:35:42.285
And some of you may have very positive stories about that.

606
00:35:43.235 --> 00:35:45.085
Some of us have kind of a mixed story.

607
00:35:45.195 --> 00:35:47.085
Some needs were met, some needs were not.

608
00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:50.965
But we want to just validate for all of you, embrace

609
00:35:51.235 --> 00:35:54.365
that every human being has needs.

610
00:35:54.825 --> 00:35:57.485
And if you cross their paths in a way

611
00:35:57.485 --> 00:35:59.285
where you have an appropriate opportunity

612
00:35:59.425 --> 00:36:03.405
to hear their story, chances are you'll be able to detect

613
00:36:03.435 --> 00:36:05.365
what some of those needs have been.

614
00:36:06.305 --> 00:36:10.205
Now, when we're married, no one on planet Earth has more

615
00:36:10.305 --> 00:36:14.405
responsibility than me to minister to her needs.

616
00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:18.205
Does that make sense? Nobody,

617
00:36:19.305 --> 00:36:22.445
pastor doesn't have more responsibility than I do

618
00:36:22.445 --> 00:36:23.885
to minister to my wife's needs,

619
00:36:23.885 --> 00:36:25.845
even if he knows a lot more Bible than me.

620
00:36:26.675 --> 00:36:31.205
It's not about that. It's I'm called by virtue of my

621
00:36:32.525 --> 00:36:35.485
choosing to commit to her to this marriage.

622
00:36:36.625 --> 00:36:39.885
That's on my job description from the time I married her.

623
00:36:40.465 --> 00:36:43.565
But hopefully I've gotten better than I was early on.

624
00:36:44.805 --> 00:36:47.765
'cause I'm learned, hopefully she could really

625
00:36:47.765 --> 00:36:48.965
throw me under the bus right there.

626
00:36:49.635 --> 00:36:52.285
Okay? And the same is true for Joyce.

627
00:36:52.425 --> 00:36:55.205
No one has more responsibility to know me deeply

628
00:36:55.345 --> 00:36:57.285
and to care for me effectively.

629
00:36:58.265 --> 00:37:01.445
So what we have found is that we did not even know

630
00:37:03.195 --> 00:37:04.725
what some of these needs would be.

631
00:37:05.665 --> 00:37:07.205
And so I'm gonna go through them briefly.

632
00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.205
I'm gonna give you a couple, a few kind

633
00:37:09.205 --> 00:37:10.725
of general things about them.

634
00:37:15.135 --> 00:37:18.485
Sorry, what I, I looked at the clock

635
00:37:18.485 --> 00:37:19.485
and I thought it said six 30

636
00:37:19.485 --> 00:37:22.005
and I said, there is no way I'm that, that far along.

637
00:37:22.475 --> 00:37:24.205
Okay, we're good. We're good.

638
00:37:24.785 --> 00:37:28.245
Um, first thing is, I've already referred

639
00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:31.285
to these relational needs are God ordained

640
00:37:32.315 --> 00:37:34.405
because they're all taken from scripture

641
00:37:34.455 --> 00:37:37.525
where he commands us to meet certain needs for each other.

642
00:37:39.245 --> 00:37:41.605
Secondly, you never outgrow the needs.

643
00:37:41.605 --> 00:37:43.045
You're born with them and you die with them.

644
00:37:45.665 --> 00:37:48.645
You go to a nursing home with older people in it,

645
00:37:49.385 --> 00:37:52.085
and you will see if you walk into that nursing home,

646
00:37:52.085 --> 00:37:53.845
if you got to kind of go into one of those rooms

647
00:37:53.845 --> 00:37:56.365
where there's a lot of people sitting around, uh,

648
00:37:56.365 --> 00:37:58.605
there'll be a lot of people that would really love it if you

649
00:37:58.605 --> 00:37:59.805
just sit down and start

650
00:37:59.805 --> 00:38:01.165
asking 'em questions about themselves.

651
00:38:01.165 --> 00:38:03.645
They have a need for attention. Okay?

652
00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:07.125
Should never have to apologize for that.

653
00:38:08.505 --> 00:38:12.325
Um, thirdly, um, they are

654
00:38:13.705 --> 00:38:17.165
intergenerational, kind of what I just said.

655
00:38:18.205 --> 00:38:22.565
Cross-gender or better way to say

656
00:38:22.565 --> 00:38:24.365
that is gender independent.

657
00:38:24.755 --> 00:38:28.885
Okay? And you go to any country in the world

658
00:38:29.025 --> 00:38:30.325
and these will be relevant

659
00:38:30.325 --> 00:38:32.485
because they're biblically defined, not

660
00:38:33.145 --> 00:38:34.605
psychologically defined.

661
00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:40.525
Okay? So we're gonna start

662
00:38:40.585 --> 00:38:41.885
and go through the list briefly,

663
00:38:42.105 --> 00:38:45.765
but um, for those of you who were at the two day workshop

664
00:38:45.765 --> 00:38:50.405
that we did, I've picked, uh, a couple of these,

665
00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:53.325
uh, three of these videos to use.

666
00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:55.845
And these are on this great commandment network,

667
00:38:55.895 --> 00:38:57.245
which I'm showing you right now.

668
00:38:57.545 --> 00:39:00.125
Any of you can access this and they're free to look at.

669
00:39:00.945 --> 00:39:03.645
But if you go to their homepage, which is where I'm at,

670
00:39:04.215 --> 00:39:08.685
great commandment.net, then click on that left symbol,

671
00:39:09.835 --> 00:39:11.925
what makes good, great relationships,

672
00:39:12.025 --> 00:39:13.685
and then just scroll down a little bit.

673
00:39:14.145 --> 00:39:16.485
And you come to these top 10 relational needs.

674
00:39:17.905 --> 00:39:19.645
And I wanna play a video. 'cause these are

675
00:39:19.645 --> 00:39:20.845
all about one minute long.

676
00:39:20.845 --> 00:39:23.325
And they're excellent definitions of the needs.

677
00:39:24.115 --> 00:39:27.845
They're animated, but that's actually good for a person.

678
00:39:28.145 --> 00:39:31.885
My age seems fun

679
00:39:33.385 --> 00:39:37.405
And I think you're great just the way you

680
00:39:37.405 --> 00:39:39.005
are. Accept it.

681
00:39:39.425 --> 00:39:41.125
I'm so sorry. I just blew that.

682
00:39:43.925 --> 00:39:47.525
I just hit the wrong button and it didn't enlarge it.

683
00:39:48.715 --> 00:39:50.765
Turn it down. Okay.

684
00:39:52.945 --> 00:39:54.445
Uh, where are we?

685
00:39:59.505 --> 00:40:01.965
So this is the first one. The need for acceptance.

686
00:40:07.925 --> 00:40:10.365
I think you're great just the way you are

687
00:40:13.105 --> 00:40:14.105
Now. We do

688
00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:14.325

689
00:40:23.805 --> 00:40:28.645
Nobody's, I think you're great just the way you are.

690
00:40:29.455 --> 00:40:31.485
Acceptance is welcoming another person,

691
00:40:31.785 --> 00:40:33.245
gladly and unconditionally.

692
00:40:33.785 --> 00:40:36.565
It is often experienced when someone focuses on

693
00:40:36.565 --> 00:40:38.085
what is great about another person,

694
00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.445
even if they're different

695
00:40:39.865 --> 00:40:42.045
or when someone goes out of their way to care,

696
00:40:42.335 --> 00:40:44.525
especially when another person has failed

697
00:40:44.905 --> 00:40:46.725
or the behavior has been less than perfect.

698
00:40:47.585 --> 00:40:49.765
The opposite of acceptance is rejection.

699
00:40:50.235 --> 00:40:53.005
Rejection is looking down on someone who is different

700
00:40:53.065 --> 00:40:55.365
or trying to change or fix another person.

701
00:40:55.985 --> 00:40:58.205
It happens when love is withheld from a

702
00:40:58.205 --> 00:40:59.525
person 'cause of their mistake.

703
00:41:00.455 --> 00:41:04.245
Acceptance sounds like I love you just the way you are

704
00:41:04.625 --> 00:41:06.805
or you messed up and it's okay.

705
00:41:07.225 --> 00:41:08.885
Or simply, I forgive you.

706
00:41:09.505 --> 00:41:11.765
So start thinking about how you'd like to give

707
00:41:11.905 --> 00:41:13.325
and receive acceptance.

708
00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:15.925
People are different and nobody's perfect.

709
00:41:16.225 --> 00:41:18.965
So who might need the gift of acceptance from you?

710
00:41:25.945 --> 00:41:30.885
So think of a time when you might have needed acceptance.

711
00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:33.685
I'm not gonna ask you to share that.

712
00:41:36.225 --> 00:41:37.845
And while you're doing that, think of

713
00:41:38.665 --> 00:41:41.885
an example in scripture where Jesus

714
00:41:43.105 --> 00:41:45.885
met the need for acceptance for someone.

715
00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:48.305
See what comes to mind.

716
00:41:57.875 --> 00:41:58.895
The woman at the well.

717
00:42:01.045 --> 00:42:02.815
Yeah. Woman at the well. Mm-Hmm.

718
00:42:02.915 --> 00:42:04.255
Why would she need acceptance?

719
00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:10.775
She'd been married how many times? A bunch. Okay.

720
00:42:11.995 --> 00:42:14.095
And that's just one thing mentioned in the

721
00:42:14.095 --> 00:42:15.255
context of that story.

722
00:42:17.165 --> 00:42:19.865
And uh, I'm not a theologian,

723
00:42:19.865 --> 00:42:21.905
but I understand that there were several things

724
00:42:22.175 --> 00:42:23.505
that were kind of related to her.

725
00:42:23.615 --> 00:42:26.745
Even the fact that she was going to a well at the time

726
00:42:26.765 --> 00:42:31.105
of day that she was, that could imply that she was not seen

727
00:42:31.105 --> 00:42:32.665
to be a woman of high reputation.

728
00:42:33.335 --> 00:42:37.105
Okay? So this would not necessarily be someone a rabbi

729
00:42:37.365 --> 00:42:38.385
was going to hang out with.

730
00:42:38.935 --> 00:42:41.985
Does that make sense? And yet Jesus did

731
00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:45.585
serving her need for acceptance.

732
00:42:45.645 --> 00:42:47.265
Can you think of another? Yeah.

733
00:42:47.285 --> 00:42:49.665
The woman that was caught when they were

734
00:42:49.665 --> 00:42:50.705
gonna throw the stones

735
00:42:50.705 --> 00:42:51.705
At her. Yeah. Caught

736
00:42:51.705 --> 00:42:54.305
in adultery. I believe he was married.

737
00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:56.945
I don't know why they didn't bring the guy too, by the way.

738
00:42:57.685 --> 00:43:02.145
But he meets this woman, the Pharisees tried to entrap him

739
00:43:02.965 --> 00:43:06.945
to kind of force his hand in some way,

740
00:43:07.275 --> 00:43:09.985
catch him in some kind of predicament.

741
00:43:10.485 --> 00:43:14.025
So they say, well, scripture says we should stoner.

742
00:43:14.855 --> 00:43:18.425
What do you say? And that's where he

743
00:43:19.275 --> 00:43:22.945
draws in the sand, picks up a or not, doesn't pick up stone.

744
00:43:22.945 --> 00:43:27.625
But he says, okay, um, Bruce is paraphrased first one of you

745
00:43:27.695 --> 00:43:32.025
that has never sinned, uh, go ahead and start throwing.

746
00:43:33.485 --> 00:43:36.425
And the scripture says, one by one they walked away

747
00:43:36.765 --> 00:43:39.905
for no one could pass that test.

748
00:43:40.435 --> 00:43:42.665
Right? Then he turns to the woman

749
00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:44.705
and he says, where are your condemners?

750
00:43:45.295 --> 00:43:48.305
Another translation says, accusers. Where are they?

751
00:43:50.115 --> 00:43:53.825
She's gone. They've gone. And what's he say?

752
00:43:54.655 --> 00:43:59.145
Neither do I condemn me. Go and sin no more.

753
00:44:00.085 --> 00:44:02.305
See, he's not being soft on sin.

754
00:44:05.845 --> 00:44:09.865
Not not Jesus. The what he's doing is he is seeing

755
00:44:09.975 --> 00:44:13.545
beneath her sin to a need that she has

756
00:44:13.605 --> 00:44:15.225
and he's ministering to that need.

757
00:44:18.365 --> 00:44:20.505
One more example that's very relevant here

758
00:44:20.505 --> 00:44:22.545
that we'll touch on again a little bit later.

759
00:44:23.445 --> 00:44:25.105
And that's the story of Zacchaeus.

760
00:44:26.285 --> 00:44:27.825
And Zacchaeus was one of these guys

761
00:44:27.825 --> 00:44:29.225
that was a tax collector,

762
00:44:29.225 --> 00:44:32.405
and yet he was collecting taxes from his own people

763
00:44:33.705 --> 00:44:35.045
and they hated him for it.

764
00:44:36.145 --> 00:44:38.525
And he was known to have ripped, ripped him off,

765
00:44:38.525 --> 00:44:40.405
taken more than he should have, et cetera.

766
00:44:41.935 --> 00:44:43.565
Jesus comes into Jericho

767
00:44:43.945 --> 00:44:45.685
and there are crowds gathering around him.

768
00:44:45.785 --> 00:44:47.125
And he passes by this tree

769
00:44:47.145 --> 00:44:49.925
and he sees Zacchaeus up in the tree and he points him out

770
00:44:49.925 --> 00:44:52.965
and says, Zacchaeus, what's he say?

771
00:44:53.425 --> 00:44:56.005
You come down, come down. You come down from here. Yeah.

772
00:44:56.075 --> 00:44:57.925
Well, many of us learned a song in

773
00:44:58.065 --> 00:44:59.365
Sunday school when we were young.

774
00:45:00.025 --> 00:45:02.245
And the way that hand motion went was,

775
00:45:02.305 --> 00:45:03.365
you come down from here.

776
00:45:03.395 --> 00:45:05.045
Like he's shaking his finger at him.

777
00:45:05.585 --> 00:45:07.405
That's how they taught us to sing it.

778
00:45:08.905 --> 00:45:11.365
And I'm gonna suggest that does not fit the story.

779
00:45:12.635 --> 00:45:15.535
He's not scolding it far from it.

780
00:45:15.725 --> 00:45:19.695
He's saying, s scripture literally says, we must come.

781
00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:22.675
I must come to your house to eat tonight.

782
00:45:24.735 --> 00:45:26.515
So I'm inviting myself over for dinner

783
00:45:27.215 --> 00:45:29.715
And also since he came down with gladness in

784
00:45:29.715 --> 00:45:30.715
His heart. Yeah.

785
00:45:30.715 --> 00:45:32.115
And you do not come down

786
00:45:32.115 --> 00:45:33.995
with gladness in your heart when you've been scolding.

787
00:45:34.675 --> 00:45:37.555
I can promise you that firsthand experience. Okay?

788
00:45:39.165 --> 00:45:42.935
There is another example where we would be

789
00:45:44.445 --> 00:45:47.335
tempted at least to be judgemental

790
00:45:48.115 --> 00:45:51.175
and condemning if we knew

791
00:45:51.755 --> 00:45:53.095
you shouldn't be hanging out with him.

792
00:45:53.095 --> 00:45:54.335
That's what the people were telling him.

793
00:45:54.435 --> 00:45:55.615
You shouldn't be hanging out with him.

794
00:45:55.765 --> 00:45:57.975
He's a liar and a cheat and a thief.

795
00:45:59.185 --> 00:46:03.375
Jesus, not soft on sin, just chooses instead that he's gonna

796
00:46:04.575 --> 00:46:07.375
actually love the man by accepting him.

797
00:46:08.595 --> 00:46:10.775
Romans two, four powerful verse.

798
00:46:11.995 --> 00:46:13.655
It says, God's kindness

799
00:46:15.055 --> 00:46:17.095
produces repentance.

800
00:46:20.675 --> 00:46:22.255
You ever wish somebody would repent?

801
00:46:24.245 --> 00:46:27.175
Well, there's one of the two reasons given in scripture as

802
00:46:27.175 --> 00:46:28.335
to how they repent.

803
00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:30.655
They are moved with God's kindness.

804
00:46:30.795 --> 00:46:32.815
In that case, Zacchaeus experienced

805
00:46:32.905 --> 00:46:34.135
God's kindness through Jesus.

806
00:46:36.075 --> 00:46:39.335
And the scripture says that night he repented

807
00:46:40.635 --> 00:46:43.855
and salvation came to his house, and then he goes back

808
00:46:43.855 --> 00:46:45.975
and even restores people's money to him.

809
00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:48.895
That's transformational change.

810
00:46:49.075 --> 00:46:52.495
And it didn't come about by somebody nagging Z to death.

811
00:46:55.115 --> 00:46:59.775
It came about by somebody carrying enough to see that

812
00:47:00.435 --> 00:47:04.535
beyond his wrong behavior, there is a guy in there

813
00:47:05.465 --> 00:47:07.695
who's dealing with a lot of rejection

814
00:47:07.695 --> 00:47:09.815
and so forth that does not justify

815
00:47:09.955 --> 00:47:12.775
or excuse his stealing from people.

816
00:47:12.955 --> 00:47:15.215
Please don't hear me wrong in that it just says,

817
00:47:15.215 --> 00:47:18.375
if you really knew, 'cause the backstory for this guy,

818
00:47:18.505 --> 00:47:21.975
you'd know, one of the things that is getting in his way

819
00:47:23.515 --> 00:47:26.215
is he doesn't feel accepted

820
00:47:27.775 --> 00:47:30.085
and that's contributing to his stuckness,

821
00:47:30.345 --> 00:47:31.445
if I could put it that way.

822
00:47:32.385 --> 00:47:35.965
So if Jesus did it, I don't have to try to defend it. Right?

823
00:47:38.885 --> 00:47:40.425
Uh, that's acceptance.

824
00:47:41.305 --> 00:47:43.585
Critically important, especially when people have messed up

825
00:47:43.925 --> 00:47:45.905
or fallen short of their own own goals.

826
00:47:46.895 --> 00:47:49.425
Okay? Um,

827
00:47:49.655 --> 00:47:52.185
it's also very important when you're different.

828
00:47:54.165 --> 00:47:56.825
Uh, I think I mentioned in the workshop a time when I went

829
00:47:56.825 --> 00:47:59.225
to another country where I was truly a minority

830
00:47:59.645 --> 00:48:01.945
and the people that were keeping me, I was staying

831
00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:04.745
with them, were treating me just like I'm one of them.

832
00:48:04.925 --> 00:48:08.625
And it helped a lot for me to not feel like an outsider.

833
00:48:09.295 --> 00:48:11.905
Okay, questions on that one?

834
00:48:13.495 --> 00:48:14.985
I'll probably spend less time on the others.

835
00:48:15.165 --> 00:48:19.585
But affection, appropriate physical touch that says,

836
00:48:19.905 --> 00:48:21.945
I care about you, you matter to me,

837
00:48:22.445 --> 00:48:24.065
and I'm not taking from you.

838
00:48:24.285 --> 00:48:25.585
I'm actually giving to you.

839
00:48:27.325 --> 00:48:28.945
So I think I might have mentioned before,

840
00:48:29.085 --> 00:48:32.705
but my father was excellent at giving affection to his kids.

841
00:48:34.525 --> 00:48:37.585
We never worried about my father losing his temper,

842
00:48:37.585 --> 00:48:39.705
getting mad at us, yelling at us or anything like that.

843
00:48:40.045 --> 00:48:41.305
But we loved his hugs.

844
00:48:43.325 --> 00:48:45.785
And I knew I was loved in those moments.

845
00:48:47.665 --> 00:48:49.145
I may not have thought it in my head,

846
00:48:49.425 --> 00:48:52.065
I just knew it's always a good thing with my dad.

847
00:48:54.445 --> 00:48:57.505
That's affection, appreciation.

848
00:48:57.875 --> 00:49:01.825
Think of that as an attaboy, that's a pat on the back

849
00:49:01.825 --> 00:49:05.425
because you've done something good, meaningful,

850
00:49:05.425 --> 00:49:07.465
helpful, appreciated.

851
00:49:09.365 --> 00:49:13.545
Um, So when, um,

852
00:49:13.855 --> 00:49:16.745
when someone like we had some work done at our house,

853
00:49:16.865 --> 00:49:18.665
I probably, one of the positive things I would've mentioned

854
00:49:18.665 --> 00:49:20.345
is they got the toilet fixed.

855
00:49:20.525 --> 00:49:22.865
Yay. You could rejoice with me on that.

856
00:49:23.565 --> 00:49:24.705
But this guy that came

857
00:49:24.705 --> 00:49:29.385
and did the work was just polite, good, helpful,

858
00:49:30.265 --> 00:49:31.665
communicated well, gave us

859
00:49:31.665 --> 00:49:33.025
explanations, all that kind of stuff.

860
00:49:33.765 --> 00:49:36.385
And, uh, and I showed my appreciation

861
00:49:36.405 --> 00:49:37.505
to him in a couple of ways.

862
00:49:37.685 --> 00:49:39.985
One was just to tell him, man,

863
00:49:40.065 --> 00:49:42.945
I appreciate the job you did and so forth.

864
00:49:44.285 --> 00:49:48.145
Um, now he probably would've done the job just as well

865
00:49:49.245 --> 00:49:51.425
if I hadn't engaged with him like that.

866
00:49:53.605 --> 00:49:56.545
But I trust that he appreciated the appreciation

867
00:49:56.935 --> 00:49:58.665
that it meant something to him.

868
00:49:58.665 --> 00:50:01.585
That somebody at least is taking time

869
00:50:01.685 --> 00:50:04.625
and to say my work was valued.

870
00:50:07.025 --> 00:50:11.305
Approval on the other hand, is not so much a pat on the back

871
00:50:11.305 --> 00:50:12.465
for doing something good.

872
00:50:12.465 --> 00:50:16.385
It's a pat on the back for being good, being

873
00:50:18.125 --> 00:50:21.665
of good character, of being special,

874
00:50:23.325 --> 00:50:26.625
Or maybe even just that.

875
00:50:26.845 --> 00:50:29.405
We, we are connected together relationally.

876
00:50:32.115 --> 00:50:36.685
I've got a, I don't know what you call a niece's husband,

877
00:50:37.225 --> 00:50:40.165
what's the word to say how he's related to me?

878
00:50:40.185 --> 00:50:41.925
But I had a niece who was married to this guy

879
00:50:42.345 --> 00:50:46.365
before she died, and Gina actually has met

880
00:50:46.365 --> 00:50:47.805
this relative of mine.

881
00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:52.245
His name's Tony. And, uh, uh,

882
00:50:53.955 --> 00:50:58.565
Tony, uh, was not a blood related member

883
00:50:58.565 --> 00:51:00.165
of the family, but we got to know him

884
00:51:00.225 --> 00:51:01.565
and came to appreciate him.

885
00:51:02.385 --> 00:51:06.405
Not for just what he did, but also just for his character.

886
00:51:06.425 --> 00:51:09.005
And he, he had loved Molly well,

887
00:51:11.025 --> 00:51:12.845
and uh, that's, if I go to him

888
00:51:12.845 --> 00:51:15.245
and just say, I'm so glad you're part of the family,

889
00:51:16.835 --> 00:51:18.325
even though he is no longer married

890
00:51:18.345 --> 00:51:19.805
to her, she's passed away.

891
00:51:21.065 --> 00:51:24.005
But I can still say to Tony, I'm, I'm, you're still part

892
00:51:24.005 --> 00:51:25.125
of the family whether you like it

893
00:51:25.125 --> 00:51:27.085
or not, you still are, you know, we love you.

894
00:51:28.745 --> 00:51:30.005
That's more about approval.

895
00:51:31.225 --> 00:51:35.605
I'm affirming him because I, I like who he is.

896
00:51:36.825 --> 00:51:38.525
Uh, I'm glad we're connected.

897
00:51:40.545 --> 00:51:43.365
If you go to those of you have kids, if you go to one

898
00:51:43.365 --> 00:51:46.885
of your kids and just call out some trait

899
00:51:46.885 --> 00:51:49.645
that you could even see in a very young child, maybe like,

900
00:51:50.185 --> 00:51:52.085
you've got a really caring,

901
00:51:52.645 --> 00:51:55.485
sensitive heart, or how about this one?

902
00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:57.445
You've got a really strong will.

903
00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:00.445
Do you ever think about affirming that one?

904
00:52:02.115 --> 00:52:05.005
It's actually a trait that God wants it

905
00:52:05.005 --> 00:52:07.845
to be used appropriately, but it's a, it's a gift.

906
00:52:10.425 --> 00:52:12.165
So when you look at your spouse

907
00:52:12.385 --> 00:52:15.565
and say, Joyce, I really appreciate that,

908
00:52:15.615 --> 00:52:20.045
especially in these last few years, I've just seen you move

909
00:52:20.045 --> 00:52:22.485
with compassion repeatedly when you hear

910
00:52:22.485 --> 00:52:23.725
about somebody with a needle.

911
00:52:24.365 --> 00:52:25.405
I mean, she did that before,

912
00:52:25.465 --> 00:52:28.605
but it's like she notched it up, ratcheted up a bit.

913
00:52:29.415 --> 00:52:30.685
She's doing that more and more.

914
00:52:31.065 --> 00:52:33.725
That's really more about her character

915
00:52:33.725 --> 00:52:37.885
and her heart that then manifests itself in behavior.

916
00:52:38.795 --> 00:52:42.325
Okay? Does that make sense? Approval attention.

917
00:52:42.815 --> 00:52:43.815
Let's watch that one.

918
00:52:50.275 --> 00:52:54.445
Attention. This is service announcements on attention.

919
00:52:55.485 --> 00:52:57.445
Some people with the top relational need

920
00:52:57.445 --> 00:52:59.885
of attention enjoy being the center of attention.

921
00:53:00.275 --> 00:53:02.005
They're often great storytellers

922
00:53:02.105 --> 00:53:03.605
or the most fun at any party.

923
00:53:04.255 --> 00:53:07.205
Other people may feel especially loved when others just

924
00:53:07.205 --> 00:53:09.765
listen attentively and discover unique things about them.

925
00:53:09.995 --> 00:53:12.725
Like a favorite drink, hobby, or interest.

926
00:53:13.505 --> 00:53:15.365
The opposite of attention is neglect,

927
00:53:15.575 --> 00:53:18.125
which can be communicated through insensitivity.

928
00:53:18.385 --> 00:53:19.405
Not noticing a need

929
00:53:19.625 --> 00:53:21.925
or failing to prioritize someone's preferences.

930
00:53:22.515 --> 00:53:26.325
Attention looks like one-on-one undivided listening in order

931
00:53:26.325 --> 00:53:27.405
to get to know someone else

932
00:53:27.505 --> 00:53:29.965
and their needs attending an important event

933
00:53:30.345 --> 00:53:33.525
or just calling to say, hi, attention sounds like,

934
00:53:33.795 --> 00:53:34.805
tell me about your day.

935
00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:37.285
How did your test go? Or let's

936
00:53:37.285 --> 00:53:38.325
do something fun this weekend.

937
00:53:38.595 --> 00:53:42.045
Your choice. So start thinking about how you'd like to give

938
00:53:42.305 --> 00:53:43.485
and receive attention

939
00:53:43.635 --> 00:53:46.965
because we all like for someone to notice us, treat us

940
00:53:46.965 --> 00:53:49.325
as special and show interest and concern.

941
00:53:55.505 --> 00:53:58.605
So, uh, in a few minutes I'm gonna give you some,

942
00:53:59.045 --> 00:54:03.485
a few minutes to take turns as a couple sharing

943
00:54:04.745 --> 00:54:07.605
one of your more important needs.

944
00:54:10.025 --> 00:54:12.365
So you may not have actually met up your

945
00:54:12.365 --> 00:54:13.405
mind what those are yet.

946
00:54:13.825 --> 00:54:16.005
Uh, I think it's on page 77 in your book

947
00:54:16.025 --> 00:54:17.045
if you have your book with you.

948
00:54:19.425 --> 00:54:21.125
And so I'm just planting that seed

949
00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:22.685
before I finish these other five.

950
00:54:22.865 --> 00:54:25.125
But I just want you to be aware,

951
00:54:25.905 --> 00:54:28.125
we only teach in order to experience.

952
00:54:29.305 --> 00:54:31.125
We want to lead you to experience something.

953
00:54:31.225 --> 00:54:32.245
So one of the things

954
00:54:32.245 --> 00:54:35.525
that can help a relationship is when we have a deeper

955
00:54:35.525 --> 00:54:38.125
understanding of what does really matter to you

956
00:54:38.945 --> 00:54:42.885
and how would you like for me to meet that need for you.

957
00:54:45.025 --> 00:54:48.285
So you, two of you could have the same high need for say,

958
00:54:48.975 --> 00:54:50.405
acceptance or attention,

959
00:54:51.185 --> 00:54:52.885
and yet the way that you want

960
00:54:52.885 --> 00:54:54.325
that need met could be different.

961
00:54:56.105 --> 00:55:00.285
And so it's my job to serve Joyce according to how she wants

962
00:55:00.285 --> 00:55:02.325
that need met and vice versa.

963
00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.605
Not me saying, well, I gave you attention,

964
00:55:06.865 --> 00:55:09.125
but it may not have been in a way that really mattered

965
00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:12.725
to her and it would be much better if

966
00:55:12.805 --> 00:55:14.845
I listened to how she wants it.

967
00:55:15.235 --> 00:55:19.765
Does that make sense? So the next one on the list is,

968
00:55:19.945 --> 00:55:23.085
um, is a comfort.

969
00:55:25.185 --> 00:55:28.085
And comfort is the need that we have

970
00:55:29.705 --> 00:55:32.765
to not be alone when we're hurting or grieving

971
00:55:33.265 --> 00:55:35.085
or experiencing a loss.

972
00:55:37.705 --> 00:55:40.045
Now, some of you may be like me that my natural

973
00:55:40.605 --> 00:55:42.165
tendency is I'm a loner.

974
00:55:42.265 --> 00:55:43.805
So sometimes my natural

975
00:55:44.445 --> 00:55:47.285
instinct is when anything is stressful

976
00:55:47.545 --> 00:55:52.525
or a lot to be done, I tend to like to have solitude.

977
00:55:54.005 --> 00:55:56.445
A solitude and aloneness are two separate things.

978
00:55:57.965 --> 00:56:00.125
Solitude is when I choose to be alone

979
00:56:01.075 --> 00:56:03.965
because that actually is helpful to me in some way.

980
00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:07.885
Aloneness is when nobody sees me, nobody gets me,

981
00:56:08.185 --> 00:56:10.405
nobody may understand what I'm going through.

982
00:56:11.985 --> 00:56:16.485
So comfort is when we draw near someone who may be hurting

983
00:56:16.625 --> 00:56:21.125
or sad or lonely or discouraged

984
00:56:22.025 --> 00:56:25.445
or feeling let down or being put down.

985
00:56:26.705 --> 00:56:28.285
And when I come alongside of them

986
00:56:29.945 --> 00:56:32.125
and I give them a safe place to talk, if that's

987
00:56:32.125 --> 00:56:34.485
what they want to do, or at the very least I just say,

988
00:56:34.605 --> 00:56:35.605
I want you to know I care.

989
00:56:36.545 --> 00:56:37.685
That's your baseline.

990
00:56:38.755 --> 00:56:42.405
Minimal expression is I want you to know I care.

991
00:56:43.435 --> 00:56:46.165
Help me understand what you're feeling, okay?

992
00:56:46.975 --> 00:56:50.605
Again, I'm not talking tonight about conflict

993
00:56:50.715 --> 00:56:51.885
between a couple.

994
00:56:52.665 --> 00:56:54.765
As much as I'm talking about other hurts

995
00:56:54.835 --> 00:56:58.885
that land in your doorstep, we will get to conflict

996
00:56:58.995 --> 00:57:01.405
between a couple that's coming later.

997
00:57:01.755 --> 00:57:04.765
This is a building block. It's can I be with you?

998
00:57:04.835 --> 00:57:08.165
Well, when you're hurting, can I do that?

999
00:57:08.355 --> 00:57:10.365
Well tonight, if that's one of your needs,

1000
00:57:10.465 --> 00:57:12.605
I'm not asking you to actually comfort them.

1001
00:57:12.785 --> 00:57:15.845
I'm asking you to share that. That's a high need.

1002
00:57:16.595 --> 00:57:18.725
That makes sense. Okay?

1003
00:57:20.965 --> 00:57:25.605
Encouragement is when you have a need to be

1004
00:57:27.255 --> 00:57:30.725
urged forward towards something that's important to you.

1005
00:57:31.705 --> 00:57:34.525
And especially if you're having trouble accomplishing it.

1006
00:57:35.345 --> 00:57:40.165
So if you're a kid trying out for, um, the,

1007
00:57:40.345 --> 00:57:41.805
the, uh, swimming team

1008
00:57:41.985 --> 00:57:43.885
and you're like,

1009
00:57:44.285 --> 00:57:46.325
I don't know if they have a depth chart on the swimming

1010
00:57:46.355 --> 00:57:48.645
team, but you're not getting to start.

1011
00:57:49.235 --> 00:57:53.005
Okay? So I might want to be at your events,

1012
00:57:53.905 --> 00:57:57.405
at your practices if they let that so

1013
00:57:57.405 --> 00:58:01.725
that I can even additionally say, I'm I'm, I'm here for you.

1014
00:58:02.625 --> 00:58:05.405
And, uh, just want you to do the best you can.

1015
00:58:06.485 --> 00:58:09.085
I want it for you, not for me. I want it for you.

1016
00:58:10.145 --> 00:58:12.165
That's urging them forward towards the goal.

1017
00:58:12.265 --> 00:58:15.685
We know the psychologically encouragement makes a

1018
00:58:15.685 --> 00:58:16.885
difference in performance.

1019
00:58:17.555 --> 00:58:21.605
It's home field advantage. Think of it that way. Okay?

1020
00:58:23.425 --> 00:58:25.885
Um, oftentimes you'll have a couple

1021
00:58:25.975 --> 00:58:28.165
where one is high on encouragement

1022
00:58:28.165 --> 00:58:30.365
and one is not something they need much.

1023
00:58:31.465 --> 00:58:32.725
Uh, that's true in our family.

1024
00:58:33.055 --> 00:58:35.445
Joyce is the one that needed very little encouragement.

1025
00:58:35.805 --> 00:58:39.565
I need a little lot. The challenge of that is she had

1026
00:58:39.565 --> 00:58:42.685
to train herself or retrain herself to watch for my need

1027
00:58:43.235 --> 00:58:45.285
because it didn't show up on her radar.

1028
00:58:45.515 --> 00:58:48.485
Does that make sense? A certain, the same kind of situation.

1029
00:58:48.485 --> 00:58:52.885
She might think, oh, we're at mile 10 on a marathon.

1030
00:58:53.045 --> 00:58:54.445
I never ran a marathon in my life.

1031
00:58:54.585 --> 00:58:58.365
I'm just using this example. We're at mile 10. No big deal.

1032
00:58:58.815 --> 00:59:01.245
We're gonna be good. I'm at mile 10

1033
00:59:01.245 --> 00:59:02.725
and I'm thinking, I'm not even halfway.

1034
00:59:04.325 --> 00:59:05.605
I I don't know if I'm gonna make this.

1035
00:59:06.145 --> 00:59:07.805
I'm starting to think negatively.

1036
00:59:08.635 --> 00:59:11.365
Well, she runs alongside of me and says, you can do it.

1037
00:59:12.275 --> 00:59:13.765
I'll meet you at the next mile. Marker.

1038
00:59:15.255 --> 00:59:18.285
There is something that's helpful about that. Okay?

1039
00:59:18.865 --> 00:59:21.725
That's encouragement, respect.

1040
00:59:22.905 --> 00:59:24.125
Uh, when George

1041
00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:28.965
and I took this test, uh, we, the test on the needs

1042
00:59:29.075 --> 00:59:33.365
that gave you a score as to which ones were highest in need

1043
00:59:33.465 --> 00:59:35.285
to you, which ones were priorities?

1044
00:59:35.825 --> 00:59:40.045
She had a 10 out of a possible 10 on respect.

1045
00:59:40.905 --> 00:59:43.885
And I did not have any clue what that meant to her.

1046
00:59:45.145 --> 00:59:47.245
The way it's defined in this book

1047
00:59:48.345 --> 00:59:52.965
is respect is basically to value someone to defer

1048
00:59:52.985 --> 00:59:56.885
to them, uh, with things that matter to them, such

1049
00:59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.645
that even going, picking a restaurant, if I wanted

1050
01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:03.565
to respect her, I wouldn't choose the restaurant

1051
01:00:03.595 --> 01:00:05.365
that I always like to go to.

1052
01:00:06.885 --> 01:00:11.455
That would be like not valuing her desires. Okay?

1053
01:00:12.555 --> 01:00:14.575
So she comes back with a 10 out of 10

1054
01:00:14.955 --> 01:00:17.135
and one of the things you'll do later is say, well,

1055
01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:18.455
how do you want me to meet that?

1056
01:00:19.795 --> 01:00:24.255
And uh, immediately when I asked her that, she said, well,

1057
01:00:24.255 --> 01:00:26.055
if you would consider my opinions.

1058
01:00:28.475 --> 01:00:30.695
And I thought maybe I already had been doing that,

1059
01:00:30.755 --> 01:00:32.775
but apparently not as much as she wanted.

1060
01:00:34.675 --> 01:00:38.295
So as simple as it sounds, write it down,

1061
01:00:38.675 --> 01:00:41.015
at least in your head or on your iPad.

1062
01:00:41.585 --> 01:00:45.015
Write it down. Ask her her opinions.

1063
01:00:45.355 --> 01:00:49.495
That's a target she's given me a clear definition of

1064
01:00:49.495 --> 01:00:51.495
that would leave me fitting more respect.

1065
01:00:52.795 --> 01:00:54.375
And then don't limit them to

1066
01:00:54.415 --> 01:00:55.815
how long they want to make that list.

1067
01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.855
Just say, I need clarity.

1068
01:00:58.895 --> 01:01:00.495
'cause I honestly, I did not know

1069
01:01:00.495 --> 01:01:01.775
what that would've meant to her.

1070
01:01:02.055 --> 01:01:03.335
I would've been shooting in the dark,

1071
01:01:04.555 --> 01:01:05.735
so in a few minutes. But the

1072
01:01:05.855 --> 01:01:09.935
Re the reason why that one was so far up there

1073
01:01:10.635 --> 01:01:14.135
is because I got so little of that from my mom.

1074
01:01:14.885 --> 01:01:17.415
Yeah, there was a history behind that one too. Yeah.

1075
01:01:18.035 --> 01:01:21.935
At the time she answered the question, uh, uh,

1076
01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.735
that was the first time I heard her talk about that part

1077
01:01:24.735 --> 01:01:26.135
of her relationship with her mom.

1078
01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:27.455
It just had never come up.

1079
01:01:27.795 --> 01:01:29.415
And she gave me several examples

1080
01:01:29.515 --> 01:01:30.615
of kind of what that looked like.

1081
01:01:30.635 --> 01:01:31.975
And it was a no brainer. Yeah.

1082
01:01:31.975 --> 01:01:35.175
That, that would probably make anybody feel disrespected.

1083
01:01:36.035 --> 01:01:39.295
And so it doesn't have to happen in childhood.

1084
01:01:39.985 --> 01:01:42.415
Don't hear me implying that.

1085
01:01:43.045 --> 01:01:46.255
It's just that when it does, you're stepping on bruises.

1086
01:01:46.755 --> 01:01:48.175
If you're missing the need.

1087
01:01:48.965 --> 01:01:51.455
Some people hurt because a need gets kind of

1088
01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:55.015
something hurtful is done.

1089
01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.015
Like I yelled at her or something like that.

1090
01:01:58.075 --> 01:02:00.935
But it'd be disrespectful sometimes it's like missing the

1091
01:02:00.935 --> 01:02:02.615
need That's hurtful enough.

1092
01:02:03.445 --> 01:02:06.725
Neglect. Then security.

1093
01:02:07.345 --> 01:02:09.885
Uh, security can be anything from

1094
01:02:11.675 --> 01:02:14.085
just talk to me in a tone of voice

1095
01:02:14.355 --> 01:02:16.725
that doesn't trigger my anxiety.

1096
01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:23.505
You know, uh, intensity

1097
01:02:24.325 --> 01:02:27.505
of conversation between Joyce

1098
01:02:27.505 --> 01:02:30.745
and me might not mean she's yelling at me.

1099
01:02:30.805 --> 01:02:33.785
It may mean it's just she's really serious about something

1100
01:02:33.785 --> 01:02:36.465
and it's intense, but that can even trigger me a little bit.

1101
01:02:36.765 --> 01:02:37.945
So she learned that

1102
01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:41.785
and we actually worked out a signal so that

1103
01:02:42.645 --> 01:02:44.145
if she was talking about something

1104
01:02:44.145 --> 01:02:45.945
and getting kind of ramped up about it

1105
01:02:46.365 --> 01:02:49.185
and it was triggering me, I would raise my hand.

1106
01:02:50.015 --> 01:02:51.905
This is what we agreed to. I'd raise my hand.

1107
01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:53.465
I wouldn't even have to explain anything.

1108
01:02:53.485 --> 01:02:57.425
She would know immediately his threshold for just gotten

1109
01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:02.065
broached and she know, knows the story behind that one.

1110
01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:06.145
Okay, so that's security, uh, relational security,

1111
01:03:06.175 --> 01:03:08.865
financial security, physical security of course,

1112
01:03:09.005 --> 01:03:10.985
but relational security just says, are we okay?

1113
01:03:11.635 --> 01:03:13.505
Might need some reassuring love.

1114
01:03:15.165 --> 01:03:18.265
And then finally, uh, support just lend me a hand.

1115
01:03:18.485 --> 01:03:19.585
I'm overwhelmed.

1116
01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:22.985
So I'm gonna give you the rest of our time tonight

1117
01:03:23.965 --> 01:03:27.065
to actually, uh, share with each other.

1118
01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:29.265
Just share one need.

1119
01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:32.465
And it doesn't have to be the most important need to you,

1120
01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:36.585
maybe it's just, you know, it's in, it's in the ballpark.

1121
01:03:37.645 --> 01:03:39.025
But I would encourage you to

1122
01:03:40.175 --> 01:03:43.145
give some idea about here's why I think that's important.

1123
01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:44.465
It's what's going on now,

1124
01:03:45.045 --> 01:03:47.865
or it's maybe what went on for me years ago.

1125
01:03:49.165 --> 01:03:50.905
And then what would be one

1126
01:03:50.905 --> 01:03:55.185
or two things that would hit that target for you?

1127
01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:58.945
What could I as your spouse do that would actually hit

1128
01:03:58.945 --> 01:03:59.945
that target for you?

1129
01:04:00.935 --> 01:04:05.105
Okay, so go ahead and share with each other. Take turns.

1130
01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:12.985
Each of you share a priority need. Okay, you bet

1131
01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:53.985
Still triggers me

1132
01:04:54.125 --> 01:04:56.665
as acceptance.

1133
01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:57.765
Make sense? But this actually at least I like sound.

1134
01:06:33.025 --> 01:06:35.285
And then, uh,

1135
01:06:38.715 --> 01:06:39.565
This comes from

1136
01:06:39.645 --> 01:06:43.725
a my wife

1137
01:06:44.075 --> 01:06:46.645
Home and Stay at home.

1138
01:06:46.825 --> 01:06:47.825
So it's kind of like me.

1139
01:06:49.165 --> 01:06:52.325
I go to work, like I'm gone from it's kind,

1140
01:06:52.395 --> 01:06:53.685
poverty, disconnected

1141
01:06:54.735 --> 01:06:55.735
Thing as I leave.

1142
01:06:55.785 --> 01:06:58.845
But when I come back, this has been tough to kind of reach.

1143
01:07:01.825 --> 01:07:06.125
So I think that appreciation piece came in.

1144
01:07:07.915 --> 01:07:12.725
When I do come home, it feels like I still continue now.

1145
01:07:13.395 --> 01:07:16.965
Like They regular kind program, like,

1146
01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:22.565
Like the schedule.

1147
01:07:25.025 --> 01:07:27.845
Lot times I

1148
01:07:29.075 --> 01:07:31.165
Kind of made changes in what I do

1149
01:07:31.165 --> 01:07:32.045
At home just to

1150
01:07:39.115 --> 01:07:40.125
Sometimes I just,

1151
01:08:34.665 --> 01:08:35.085
How else

1152
01:08:47.745 --> 01:08:47.965
on?

1153
01:09:27.565 --> 01:09:31.365
I wouldn't say, but it kind

1154
01:09:31.365 --> 01:09:36.245
of got little heated.

1155
01:09:37.425 --> 01:09:40.365
Um, we just kind of took a break from the conversation.

1156
01:09:40.605 --> 01:09:44.005
I don't think we, um,

1157
01:09:44.665 --> 01:09:46.045
it was definitely some things that I,

1158
01:09:57.745 --> 01:09:58.845
the necessity there.

1159
01:10:11.925 --> 01:10:12.205
I just,

1160
01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:47.645
I had to do her

1161
01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.125
ask what I would

1162
01:10:51.145 --> 01:10:55.965
be hard.

1163
01:11:02.705 --> 01:11:06.445
How did you get to where you could kind of process

1164
01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:07.285
and work through

1165
01:11:29.305 --> 01:11:32.845
and so, and say she,

1166
01:11:39.985 --> 01:11:41.165
and then she would start

1167
01:11:45.185 --> 01:11:45.805
all I could figure,

1168
01:12:18.675 --> 01:12:21.805
what is your website?

1169
01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:24.725
Have you did the videos on, what was it called?

1170
01:12:25.185 --> 01:12:25.885
The one I had

1171
01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:30.325
command Great commandment.

1172
01:12:30.525 --> 01:12:33.165
TI don't, okay. I

1173
01:12:33.165 --> 01:12:36.605
Think she got, I just think now

1174
01:12:42.245 --> 01:12:44.765
I haven't always been presence.

1175
01:12:47.345 --> 01:12:51.285
So it's kind one of those things where I think with our

1176
01:12:52.815 --> 01:12:55.605
uniqueness, part of its emotional.

1177
01:13:03.595 --> 01:13:04.725
When we first got married,

1178
01:13:06.785 --> 01:13:11.605
Um, We both worked.

1179
01:13:12.185 --> 01:13:14.565
So, So it was kind of like we both kind of have

1180
01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:19.685
the finances and more the business of our,

1181
01:13:20.425 --> 01:13:22.925
Uh, So now that she doesn't,

1182
01:13:30.595 --> 01:13:35.525
it's kind of difficult, like me to have my work, finances,

1183
01:13:38.285 --> 01:13:40.805
finances at home because she's at home when she

1184
01:13:40.805 --> 01:13:42.205
does, you know, job

1185
01:13:42.595 --> 01:13:44.605
Kids Stuff and it,

1186
01:13:46.435 --> 01:13:51.245
It's just A few more transactions she handle that.

1187
01:13:51.265 --> 01:13:52.265
And,

1188
01:13:53.585 --> 01:13:57.965
Um, We got some stuff to work on the credit,

1189
01:13:59.065 --> 01:14:03.845
uh, even though like I do make, you know, most of the money

1190
01:14:03.845 --> 01:14:07.725
that goes into the houses just accurate

1191
01:14:07.725 --> 01:14:10.285
there possibly.

1192
01:14:10.825 --> 01:14:15.325
So some of you will be wrapping up here, which is fine.

1193
01:14:17.465 --> 01:14:22.165
Um, just was gonna put this on his

1194
01:14:22.165 --> 01:14:24.605
background music, but it's, uh, Jason Mraz.

1195
01:14:25.185 --> 01:14:27.525
And we showed this in the two day workshop,

1196
01:14:27.705 --> 01:14:29.205
but it was with different video.

1197
01:14:29.925 --> 01:14:33.845
I just love this video. But at any rate, I'm just gonna play

1198
01:14:33.845 --> 01:14:35.845
that as background since everybody got quiet.

1199
01:14:36.745 --> 01:14:40.045
Let just say bottom line of all this stuff about needs

1200
01:14:41.825 --> 01:14:46.045
is that God is the source of all the provision

1201
01:14:46.665 --> 01:14:47.845
for all of the needs.

1202
01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:52.845
He is the source I love because he first loved me.

1203
01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:56.445
I just don't love as consistently, of course, as God does.

1204
01:14:57.515 --> 01:15:02.285
He's a source. But I am often his chosen delivery assistant.

1205
01:15:04.955 --> 01:15:08.365
It's like he doesn't have to have my feet,

1206
01:15:08.545 --> 01:15:09.565
my boots on the ground,

1207
01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:15.485
but he wants to have my boots on the ground ministering

1208
01:15:15.505 --> 01:15:17.645
to her as she ministers to me.

1209
01:15:18.385 --> 01:15:19.885
And he gets the glory for that.

1210
01:15:21.065 --> 01:15:24.845
But he, he wants us as part of his team.

1211
01:15:26.225 --> 01:15:28.085
And so I just want to encourage you with that.

1212
01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:32.725
This is a very, very positive piece of the whole journey.

1213
01:15:34.305 --> 01:15:37.885
And when we see that it's not a have to,

1214
01:15:38.765 --> 01:15:42.885
although sometimes it costs to give, it's not

1215
01:15:44.075 --> 01:15:45.445
best to see it as I have to.

1216
01:15:45.555 --> 01:15:46.565
It's more of a get to.

1217
01:15:48.425 --> 01:15:52.325
But it always helps me to think he's in the driver's seat.

1218
01:15:52.785 --> 01:15:56.645
I'm riding shotgun and I got the stuff that, that he needs

1219
01:15:56.645 --> 01:15:57.925
because he has loved me first.

1220
01:15:58.395 --> 01:16:03.325
Okay? So my encouragement is keep working on

1221
01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:07.405
your, uh, on your daily devotional kind of thing

1222
01:16:07.405 --> 01:16:08.885
with the Call to Love book.

1223
01:16:09.115 --> 01:16:10.565
Just keep chipping away at that.

1224
01:16:11.345 --> 01:16:14.605
Um, I was asked about the website,

1225
01:16:14.625 --> 01:16:16.005
so I put the website up here on the

1226
01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.125
board in case you didn't get it earlier.

1227
01:16:17.125 --> 01:16:20.605
That's where I was using the definitions.

1228
01:16:21.585 --> 01:16:25.685
And uh, if there's anything else that you see that I'm using

1229
01:16:25.785 --> 01:16:28.605
as an illustration or something, please feel free to ask me.

1230
01:16:28.975 --> 01:16:30.165
We'll share that with anybody.

1231
01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:32.925
So, uh, we just want to pass it on.

1232
01:16:34.225 --> 01:16:37.925
So let me pause this and, uh, I'll pray for us

1233
01:16:37.925 --> 01:16:40.045
and you can stay if you want

1234
01:16:40.105 --> 01:16:42.925
or you can head on home in the cold.

1235
01:16:43.945 --> 01:16:45.325
Father, thank you for your word.

1236
01:16:45.325 --> 01:16:50.205
Thank you for your spirit that does, uh, continue

1237
01:16:50.225 --> 01:16:53.605
to work in us, uh, the good work that you began

1238
01:16:54.585 --> 01:16:56.685
and help us to just keep getting up

1239
01:16:56.685 --> 01:16:59.485
and responding well when we, every time we can.

1240
01:17:00.465 --> 01:17:05.125
Um, I thank you for, uh,

1241
01:17:05.185 --> 01:17:08.925
loving us first so that we even have capacity for it.

1242
01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:12.485
It, and let's be, uh, salt

1243
01:17:12.505 --> 01:17:16.605
and light in this world that so needs your love to be

1244
01:17:17.395 --> 01:17:20.325
experienced and, uh, put to work.

1245
01:17:20.825 --> 01:17:23.365
In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.

1246
01:17:23.475 --> 01:17:24.605
Okay, well see you next week.

1247
01:17:24.615 --> 01:17:28.765
We're gonna take up the next week.

1248
01:17:29.185 --> 01:17:33.005
So this will be week three of your

1249
01:17:33.675 --> 01:17:34.845
journey through the book.

1250
01:17:36.415 --> 01:17:39.925
Sound good? Yes ma'am. Thank y'all for being here.

1251
01:17:40.065 --> 01:17:43.645
Yes, I would've hated to have made a video on my own,

1252
01:17:45.025 --> 01:17:48.285
not you.

1253
01:17:48.635 --> 01:17:51.205
Good to see you. Take care. Tell your wife for a second.
