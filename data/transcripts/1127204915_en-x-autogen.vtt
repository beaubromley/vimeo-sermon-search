00:00:02.155 --> 00:00:03.245
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:06.845
Uh, we have a privilege of five baptisms today

3
00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:09.085
and, uh, two during this service.

4
00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.485
And the first of which is my buddy Ryland Baker, uh,

5
00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:16.485
my personal ski instructor.

6
00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.605
Um, and so Ryland has, um,

7
00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.045
heard from the Lord and he's called him

8
00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.525
to himself in salvation.

9
00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:29.605
And, uh, before the church, he wanted to declare

10
00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:31.365
that he is a child of God.

11
00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:32.605
And so, um,

12
00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:36.325
because of that profession of faith in Jesus Christ,

13
00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:40.205
it's my privilege to baptize you, my brother, in the name

14
00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:41.645
of the Father, the Son,

15
00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:46.865
and the Holy Spirit Church.

16
00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:50.585
We'd love for you to continue to pray for Ryland

17
00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:51.585
and his sanctification

18
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.945
and that he grows up to be a man of God.

19
00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:55.865
So.
