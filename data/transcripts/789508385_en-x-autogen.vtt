1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.600
Well, good evening is so good to see all your faces.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.200
So glad that you were here. There's quite

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.300
a few groups of us joining on a Wednesday

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.500
night. And so the students are here some

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.900
of the kids all the way down to kindergarten if

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.600
you have kids that are Pre-K and

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.300
under I just want to let you know that there is child

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.600
care available for them if you need that and so we can

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.500
give you space to be able to go and take your

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.800
kid over there if you need it, but I wanted to frame tonight

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
for all of us. I want us to understand why

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.600
we are here tonight.

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.700
This is a night of worship. And so

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.500
what is worship and what

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.000
is not worship so tonight Worship Is

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.100
Us?

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.600
In a continuation of our life of worship coming

18
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200
here to sing together as a

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.900
church body.

20
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.500
and to worship

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.400
our creator

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.500
and what an honor it is for us to come here tonight to

23
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.400
be able to do that.

24
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.800
worship is

25
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.200
Songs right, but what it's not

26
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.900
is not just songs.

27
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.200
And I think it's important for us to know that songs are just

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.700
a vehicle for us as a church to be able to sing God's truth.

29
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.300
There are incredibly good servant that

30
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
God gives us to be able to sing his truth.

31
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
And so worship is songs, but it's not just that.

32
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.000
Then the other thing I want to remind us of is that sometimes we

33
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.400
all have our preferences of what songs we

34
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.800
should sing.

35
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.200
And shouldn't sing and I just ask tonight that even in

36
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
my own heart that we would just lay those things down and we would be

37
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.400
here to be about Jesus Christ

38
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.800
and to sing the truth to him

39
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.100
and praise him.

40
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
And so worship is lifting up our voices and singing.

41
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.800
What worship is not Is Us?

42
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.400
Listening to God's truth and only taking that in and

43
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.900
letting it be informational.

44
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.200
It's actually something that's formational for us.

45
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.400
But also it's something that we express.

46
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.700
And so when we sing and we hear God's truth, it's

47
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.400
something that should stir our affections for him.

48
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.400
And excite our hearts as a church body together, so tonight

49
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.700
I ask you invite you.

50
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
To be here tonight to sing God's truth and not

51
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500
just a firm God's truth. But also allow

52
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.300
that truth to stir your heart and

53
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.500
your mind to praise him to honor

54
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.900
him with your heart.

55
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.100
And so right now I'm gonna ask you to stand and I'm

56
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.900
going to ask God to help us tonight to do that together.

57
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.700
So would you pray with me?

58
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.300
Father we come tonight with open hands.

59
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.200
This night is yours.

60
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.500
Whatever we came in with.

61
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.800
Whether there was traffic.

62
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.000
wrangling kids

63
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.200
maybe there was moments of pain.

64
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.400
Maybe there is.

65
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.300
Apathy in our hearts as we walked through these doors, but I

66
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.500
pray that so we walk through these doors tonight. We would encounter you.

67
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.300
We would encounter you our creator.

68
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300
Because we're eager.

69
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.100
For you to move in our hearts and do what only you can

70
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.100
do.

71
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.400
But I know that there's parts of our hearts that can

72
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.000
easily drift off into thought and to other things.

73
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.300
Would you sinner us but you grab our attention?

74
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.700
Would we leave space for you tonight?

75
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.300
We allow you to make room in our hearts.

76
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.600
And by your spirit would we invest fully

77
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.000
into what's happening tonight?

78
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.000
God help us not waste a moment.

79
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.500
and win

80
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.400
my heart

81
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.000
our hearts don't feel

82
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.000
a word or a moment to help us because

83
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.300
he prays that we are going to lift up tonight.

84
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.100
You're worthy of that.

85
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.000
We lay aside what we're expecting.

86
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.700
We give this all to you because it's yours.

87
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.300
Father I pray that you would inhabit the Praises of

88
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.200
your people tonight.

89
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.100
Lay your burdens down.

90
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.500
If you're

91
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.200
willing put your hands out in front of you as a

92
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.400
symbol to give to him.

93
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.300
sign of your surrender to him

94
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.300
every burden

95
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.900
every

96
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.800
this is my surrender.

97
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.200
Where I lay down every line

98
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.900
every time.

99
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.000
This is my Sur.

100
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.900
Render, and I will make room for you.

101
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.800
To do whatever

102
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.400
you want.

103
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.200
Whatever you want.

104
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.900
And I will make room.

105
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.700
To whatever you want to

106
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.400
whatever you

107
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.900
want.

108
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.900
Here is where I lay it down

109
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.200
every burden every

110
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.600
Crown. This is my

111
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.800
surrender.

112
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.600
This is my surrender.

113
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.500
Here is where I lay it down

114
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.500
every lion every day.

115
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.900
do whatever you

116
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.400
here

117
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.000
you

118
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.800
your way you

119
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.900
do whatever you

120
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.600
to

121
00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.400
and I will make

122
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.600
for you

123
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.800
to do whatever you

124
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.500
want to do whatever you

125
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.800
want and I will make for you.

126
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.200
to do whatever you

127
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.100
Want so do whatever you want to.

128
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.500
hear

129
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.100
this is my

130
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.800
Surrender, this is my spirit.

131
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.700
Here is where I lay down

132
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.400
every

133
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.200
This is my surrender.

134
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.000
God we confess that your way is better.

135
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.500
if we try

136
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.400
that we have made on our own we tend to always fail.

137
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.000
God would you show us the airway? It's infinitely

138
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.000
better than yours.

139
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.400
Just sing This Together your way is better.

140
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.700
You always better.

141
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.800
Your way is better.

142
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.500
In your ways better we confess

143
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.900
that you always better.

144
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.900
He always better.

145
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.900
In your ways better in your

146
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.800
way is better.

147
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.200
Week as I was praying for this night.

148
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.200
God brought Psalm 139 to mind.

149
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.800
As we think about how we were created.

150
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.900
How we should go about our lives?

151
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.500
This Psalm should inform us how we should live

152
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.400
and it's because he's the one that made us

153
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.600
and so we didn't make ourselves.

154
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.500
Obviously he made us.

155
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.100
And so I want to read this for us and I'm gonna even emphasize

156
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.800
moments in it.

157
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.500
You let this psalm.

158
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.500
Affect your heart right now.

159
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.800
Oh Lord. You've searched me.

160
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.400
Known me.

161
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.100
every physical action

162
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.000
you know when I sit down, you know when I Rise Up

163
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.000
you discern my thoughts from afar.

164
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.600
You searched out my path and my lying

165
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.200
down and are acquainted with all of my

166
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:36.600
ways.

167
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.400
Even before a word is on my tongue and

168
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.400
behold. Oh Lord, you know it all together.

169
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.600
You hit me in behind and before and you

170
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600
let your hand upon me.

171
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.300
The fact that he knows us this well.

172
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.200
This should.

173
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.000
Stun us. That's why the

174
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.500
response is such knowledge is too wonderful for me.

175
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600
Cannot attain it.

176
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.300
so like John said

177
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.100
where am I going to go except for with you? So where shall

178
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.900
I go from your spirit?

179
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.500
Where shall I free from your presence?

180
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.700
If I ascended to Heaven you're there if I

181
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.200
make my bed and Shield or hell you're there, too.

182
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.400
If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the utmost parts

183
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.300
of the sea, even there your hands should lead

184
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.100
me and your right hand shall hold me.

185
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.400
And if I say surely the darkness shall cover

186
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.200
me in the light about me be night. Even the

187
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200
darkness is not.

188
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.300
It's not dark to you. The night is bright as the

189
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.500
day.

190
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.200
For darkness is as light with you.

191
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.000
So there is no where we can go without our

192
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.100
creator knowing us.

193
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.600
How comforting is that?

194
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.600
and then he tells us even how we're formed so he

195
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.600
knows not only who we are where we are what we're doing, but he

196
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.100
also knows

197
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.600
he knows our past present and future so you formed

198
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.700
me in my inward parts of kids. God formed

199
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.200
you and your mommy.

200
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.700
Isn't that amazing?

201
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.300
He formed my inward Parts. You knitted me together in my

202
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.300
mother's womb. So I praise you for I'm

203
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.500
fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful or

204
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.100
your works.

205
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.400
My soul knows it very well. My frame was

206
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.400
not hidden from you when I was being made in

207
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.300
secret and intricately woven and the depths

208
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.700
of the earth your eyes saw my unformed substance

209
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.500
in your book were written every one

210
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.100
of them the days that were formed for me.

211
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.000
When is yet? There was none of them.

212
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.100
Say this back.

213
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.100
Precious to me or your thoughts

214
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.900
of God. How vast is the sum of them? If I

215
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.300
could count them. They're more than the sand.

216
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.100
I awake and I'm still with you.

217
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.100
And so when we sing a song that says I want to make a room for God

218
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.600
in my life. I want to surrender. This is what I do. It's because of

219
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.300
this it's because he created us he

220
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.600
knows better than me and he knows way better

221
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.200
than all of us put together. He knows

222
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.200
us. So let's let him lead us surrender should

223
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.500
be our response to that. And so

224
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.200
let's sing.

225
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.000
The song I surrender all to him.

226
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.200
Oh.

227
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.400

It's the picture into the the throne room in heaven.

349
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:38.200

350
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.500

And worship him.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800
Who lives forever and ever?

355
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.500
And they cast their crowns Before the Throne.

356
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.500
They say worthy. Are you our Lord

357
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500

we're in the first week of a new year.

362
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:43.700
and we

363
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.800
were gathered here together.

364
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.200
Tell Jesus he is worthy.

365
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.700

366
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.700
a few minutes and just tell him he's worthy.

367
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.200
of whatever comes Whatever May Come

368
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.800
whatever has come in our lives that he is worthy

369
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.000
of all glory all honor.

370
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.500

371
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.000
and I'll guide us through a few

372
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.800
moments, but just take a moment. There's 30 seconds or so to tell

373
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.200
Jesus.

374
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.600

375
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.400
for our sin

376
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.700
So we do that we we saw that the elders cashed

377
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.600
