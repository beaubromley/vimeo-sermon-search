1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.745
Because the reality of what we just did is so important.

2
00:00:02.845 --> 00:00:05.785
But the truth is that if he only died,

3
00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:10.105
if you remember a couple weeks ago at Easter Sunday,

4
00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:14.265
we said this, if he only died, we are still in our sins.

5
00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:20.745
One Corinthians 15 then says that faith is hopeless.

6
00:00:22.415 --> 00:00:24.585
That what we're doing here is really useless.

7
00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:28.345
It's pointless for us to believe in this thing.

8
00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:34.225
That's why the truth that we're gonna highlight today is

9
00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:38.665
that our God is faithful in victory is so important.

10
00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:41.465
That's why this is so critical.

11
00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:44.865
Victory not only over sin on the cross,

12
00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:49.385
which we just celebrated, but victory over death itself.

13
00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.895
And so turn with me in God's word to one Corinthians 15.

14
00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.975
We're gonna see this very clearly today.

15
00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:01.375
One Corinthians chapter 15.

16
00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:08.495
Now there, there were some people back in Corinth, this city

17
00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.655
that Paul was writing this letter to that denied the reality

18
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:12.695
of resurrection at all.

19
00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:18.465
And so Paul spent the entire chapter defending the

20
00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:20.145
reality of resurrection.

21
00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:21.985
That it's legit, it's real.

22
00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:24.945
But there were some people who said, okay, yeah,

23
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:26.225
resurrection's real.

24
00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:29.025
But there were, there was questions being asked about

25
00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:31.465
what happened to those, not just who died

26
00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:33.505
before Jesus would return.

27
00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:35.265
But what about those who were left alive

28
00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:36.705
when Jesus returned?

29
00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:40.905
Because at the time, in their thought process,

30
00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:43.425
they had a dualistic view of the person

31
00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:46.465
that there was a body and there was a soul.

32
00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:51.625
But they saw the body as bad, as evil, as something

33
00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:53.905
that the soul needed to be freed from.

34
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.425
So they said, well, if somebody dies, then their body's gone

35
00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.665
and their soul is freed to be with the Lord forever.

36
00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:02.305
That's great. So we want to die

37
00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:03.785
before Jesus comes back, right?

38
00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.985
But if you were still alive when Jesus came back,

39
00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:11.185
then you were stuck 'cause you hadn't been freed yet from

40
00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:13.785
this trap of the body.

41
00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:16.995
Well, that's part of what Paul addressed here.

42
00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:20.275
He says throughout this chapter that everyone,

43
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:23.275
whether you're dead or alive, when Jesus returns,

44
00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:24.995
everyone receives the same treatment.

45
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:27.815
We all have the same problem.

46
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:29.615
So we all need the same solution.

47
00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:31.095
Whether you're dead or alive, it doesn't matter.

48
00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:34.695
We get the same solution. So look at the end of chapter 15.

49
00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:36.335
This is his capstone argument.

50
00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:38.815
What he goes through the whole process teaching this

51
00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:40.975
rhetorically, arguing for this.

52
00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:44.135
Here's how he ends verses 50 through 58.

53
00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:50.255
As I tell you this, brothers flesh

54
00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.775
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,

55
00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.735
Nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.

56
00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.885
Behold, I tell you a mystery, we shall not all sleep,

57
00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:02.845
but we shall all be changed.

58
00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:04.445
Meaning we won't all die,

59
00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:08.485
but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling

60
00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:10.365
of an eye at the last trumpet.

61
00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:12.245
For the trumpet will sound

62
00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:14.045
and the dead will be raised imperishable

63
00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:16.165
and we shall be changed.

64
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:20.245
For this perishable body must put on the imperishable,

65
00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:22.765
this mortal body must put on immortality.

66
00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:25.725
When the perishable puts on the imperishable

67
00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:28.245
and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come

68
00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:29.885
to pass the saying that is written,

69
00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:32.405
death is swallowed up in victory.

70
00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:36.565
Oh, death. Where is your victory? Oh, death.

71
00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:37.885
Where is your sting?

72
00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:43.675
The sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law.

73
00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:48.435
But thanks be to God who gives us the victory

74
00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:50.195
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

75
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:56.715
Therefore, my beloved brothers be steadfast, immovable,

76
00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:00.795
always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing

77
00:04:00.795 --> 00:04:03.915
that in the Lord your labor is not in

78
00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:05.305
Vain.

79
00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:08.495
God, help us understand this clearly today.

80
00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:10.895
Awaken us, give us joy.

81
00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:15.215
Give us excitement for this reality that is come

82
00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:16.815
and will come for us.

83
00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:20.435
In Jesus' name. Amen.

84
00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:24.995
Alright, so let's unpack this passage because I said it.

85
00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:26.675
He's making rhetorical argument here.

86
00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:28.195
The first thing he says is

87
00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:29.915
that there's a problem that we all have.

88
00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:33.095
That's the first question here.

89
00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:34.895
What's the problem that he's addressing?

90
00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:39.335
Well, look again at at verse 50, he said, I tell you this,

91
00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.175
meaning listen up, this is important.

92
00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:45.935
Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.

93
00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:49.495
Flesh and blood was a common phrase for the physical body.

94
00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:53.375
And he says here, the physical body as it is,

95
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:54.855
cannot possess the kingdom.

96
00:04:56.785 --> 00:05:00.095
Since the kingdom of God is spiritual in nature, first

97
00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:02.055
the physical body

98
00:05:02.055 --> 00:05:06.255
that we have can't get there even further.

99
00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:11.095
He adds, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.

100
00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:14.695
That imperishable inheritance that one Peter talks about

101
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.095
that word perishable means corrupted or

102
00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:19.255
or that it breaks down.

103
00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:22.825
So here's an example. Just think about the perishable food

104
00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:24.665
on your shelf, right?

105
00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:27.385
You know that that has an expiration date, right?

106
00:05:28.085 --> 00:05:29.385
It will not last forever.

107
00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:34.345
You can watch it degrade over time as that food perishes.

108
00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:38.665
Isn't that true of our physical bodies?

109
00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:43.095
That's part of the problem here,

110
00:05:43.095 --> 00:05:45.415
that we are perishable, right?

111
00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:48.735
That's what he says here. We physical bodies,

112
00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:51.015
we are perishable.

113
00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:56.185
Just like that. Milk in your fridge like we are perishable.

114
00:05:56.805 --> 00:06:00.005
We are fading away. We are degrading over time.

115
00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:03.445
Romans eight says, creation itself is in bondage

116
00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:05.645
to corruption, to this perishing.

117
00:06:05.715 --> 00:06:10.505
It's fading. That's why verse 53, he says,

118
00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:11.625
this perishable,

119
00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:16.025
perishable body must put on the perishable.

120
00:06:17.775 --> 00:06:20.365
These dying bodies cannot inherit the kingdom of God.

121
00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:22.125
So something has to change.

122
00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:28.165
But how often do we want to deny that reality

123
00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:29.565
that we're perishing, right?

124
00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:34.645
Like, why do Americans spend billions upon billions

125
00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:37.245
of dollars each year on diet fads,

126
00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:40.645
the latest workout regimen, plastic surgery,

127
00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:43.005
all these things to say, no, no, I'm not perishing.

128
00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.985
Why do we do that? Because we don't want to admit

129
00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:50.385
that we are perishable.

130
00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:54.185
We don't wanna admit that we live in a, a world tainted

131
00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:56.945
by sin and bodies affected by sin.

132
00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:02.995
We will not be perfect. We cannot maintain perfection.

133
00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:10.465
Yet, for me, it's still been hard to wrap my mind

134
00:07:10.465 --> 00:07:12.465
around the fact that my knee is not healing, right?

135
00:07:12.905 --> 00:07:14.105
I can't do what I used to do.

136
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:19.105
But isn't that a pride that somehow in my mind,

137
00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:23.025
I think I'm somehow immune to this perishing

138
00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:27.275
that I, I've got a, a get outta jail free card in that,

139
00:07:27.275 --> 00:07:29.675
that I'm, I get a pass that I don't have to suffer

140
00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:31.275
and perish like every one of us does.

141
00:07:33.635 --> 00:07:38.005
It's my unwillingness to admit my creatureliness

142
00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:41.575
before the creator that I'm perishing.

143
00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:44.175
We are perishing. And so that's a problem.

144
00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:47.295
But there's an even worse problem than the fact

145
00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:49.535
that our joints creak when we wake up.

146
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.845
It's the fact that we are mortal, we're perishable,

147
00:07:57.845 --> 00:07:59.065
but we are mortal.

148
00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:03.705
Verse th 53, he says,

149
00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:07.305
this mortal body must put put on immortality.

150
00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:10.565
It's almost like he's pointing at his own body.

151
00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:14.245
Like this mortal body has to put on immortality.

152
00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:17.245
That word means subject to death.

153
00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:19.245
That that mortal means we

154
00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:21.085
as this body will not live forever.

155
00:08:24.715 --> 00:08:26.545
Again, we put that off. We try to avoid it.

156
00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:28.505
We, we think we're invincible when we're young.

157
00:08:28.655 --> 00:08:29.745
It's not gonna happen to me.

158
00:08:33.165 --> 00:08:34.825
It says reality. Now, I'm not trying

159
00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:37.545
to put a damper on your celebrations today,

160
00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:41.585
but a healthy perspective in life is that each one

161
00:08:41.585 --> 00:08:43.905
of us woke up today one day closer to death,

162
00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:45.905
happy Mother's Day, right?

163
00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:55.765
But that's true, isn't it? We can't avoid it. Hebrews 9 27.

164
00:08:55.915 --> 00:08:57.445
It's destined for man to die once

165
00:08:58.095 --> 00:09:02.765
after that face judgment, every one of us a hundred percent.

166
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:08.725
But that also means unless something gives us immortality,

167
00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:13.275
then we're stuck in this mortal state

168
00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:14.675
where death is a reality.

169
00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:20.105
So we got perishing, we got mortal.

170
00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:21.185
That's problem after problem.

171
00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:23.225
But the biggest problem in all of this

172
00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:26.225
is the fact that we are sinful.

173
00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:32.565
Yes, perishable mortal is a problem difficult.

174
00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:36.205
But the worst part is that we are perishable.

175
00:09:37.605 --> 00:09:41.395
We are sinful. I mean, look at verse 56 again.

176
00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:45.905
The sting of death is sin.

177
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.585
The power of sin is the law.

178
00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:53.585
Now I know it's short, but it's a really interesting verse.

179
00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:55.705
It teaches us, check this out,

180
00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:58.265
that it's not death in itself.

181
00:09:58.775 --> 00:10:00.065
That is the harmful thing.

182
00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:06.825
It's the Romans six wages of sin, death. That's the problem.

183
00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:11.825
And you see that here because actually over in Philippians

184
00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:16.655
one, Paul talks about how death is gain for, for him.

185
00:10:16.695 --> 00:10:18.455
Death is, is not a loss.

186
00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:20.055
To depart and be

187
00:10:20.055 --> 00:10:22.775
with the Lord is far better than even living here.

188
00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:24.855
So to him, death's not a problem.

189
00:10:28.015 --> 00:10:30.795
Here's the reality. Where sin is pardoned,

190
00:10:31.885 --> 00:10:33.115
death has no sting,

191
00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:38.895
but it's when sin has not been dealt with.

192
00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:42.065
That's where death is.

193
00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:46.465
This lethal adversary, this poisonous snake

194
00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:50.065
that we can't get away from and we can't fix and deal with.

195
00:10:50.325 --> 00:10:51.465
That's where death is a problem,

196
00:10:51.605 --> 00:10:53.905
is when sin is still in involved

197
00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:57.425
and it's God's law that shows us our sin.

198
00:10:57.605 --> 00:11:00.105
But the problem is God's law cannot fix the

199
00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:01.465
problem of our sin.

200
00:11:01.805 --> 00:11:04.665
That's why the power of sin is the law.

201
00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:10.065
It keeps us trapped unless something intervenes.

202
00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:17.295
So again, our problem is that without an intervention,

203
00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:20.335
every single one of us is perishing

204
00:11:20.835 --> 00:11:24.615
and will one day die condemned in our sin.

205
00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:32.065
So what's the solution, right?

206
00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:33.985
We've identified the problem very clearly.

207
00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.145
What's the solution then if that's our problem?

208
00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:38.585
If our problem is that we can't fix it on our own,

209
00:11:38.975 --> 00:11:40.025
what is the solution?

210
00:11:40.045 --> 00:11:42.185
That's where God's faithfulness comes in.

211
00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:45.065
Talking about God's faithfulness.

212
00:11:45.255 --> 00:11:49.225
This whole series, his faithfulness here is that

213
00:11:49.445 --> 00:11:52.585
before time began, God knew this was gonna be a problem

214
00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.165
for his created beings.

215
00:11:55.345 --> 00:11:56.925
So what did he do to overcome it?

216
00:11:56.995 --> 00:11:58.245
Look at verse 57,

217
00:11:58.665 --> 00:12:01.685
but thanks be to God who gives us the victory

218
00:12:02.115 --> 00:12:04.245
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

219
00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:09.245
The solution is victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

220
00:12:09.275 --> 00:12:12.165
That was it, right? It was Christ's victory

221
00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:14.565
that accomplished all of this

222
00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:16.925
that fixed our deepest problem.

223
00:12:19.785 --> 00:12:23.445
And first it was victory over sin like we just celebrated.

224
00:12:23.505 --> 00:12:24.565
In the Lord's Supper,

225
00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.325
we celebrate Christ's victory over sin.

226
00:12:31.475 --> 00:12:33.955
'cause remember, the only sting death has is

227
00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:35.715
whenever it's affected by sin.

228
00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:38.435
Whenever sin has not been dealt with.

229
00:12:38.535 --> 00:12:40.115
And so what did Christ do?

230
00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:46.145
He satisfied the claims of the law on us.

231
00:12:47.695 --> 00:12:49.985
This is how Galatians three 13 says it,

232
00:12:51.485 --> 00:12:54.985
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law

233
00:12:55.565 --> 00:12:57.345
by becoming a curse for us.

234
00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:00.375
For it is written curse.

235
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.495
It is everyone who's hanged on a tree,

236
00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:05.575
the sting of sin.

237
00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:07.575
Christ took it on himself.

238
00:13:10.445 --> 00:13:13.055
He's dealt thoroughly with the problem of sin

239
00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:16.575
through never sending himself yet taking on

240
00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:21.965
our place on the cross, sacrificing himself as a penalty

241
00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:24.445
for our sin to cover it.

242
00:13:26.485 --> 00:13:29.065
So he claimed victory over sin.

243
00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:30.705
And listen that victory is not just future.

244
00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:33.675
It's not just applicable to when you die.

245
00:13:33.695 --> 00:13:35.875
You finally get to be with God forever.

246
00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:38.315
Christ's victory over sin matters even today.

247
00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:41.395
Church, if he

248
00:13:42.195 --> 00:13:45.115
released us from the curse of the sin in our lives,

249
00:13:45.175 --> 00:13:48.195
if he freed us from the chains of sin in our lives,

250
00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:49.235
that means that's today.

251
00:13:50.335 --> 00:13:55.235
Not just future, that we can walk live in the freedom

252
00:13:56.505 --> 00:13:58.195
that sin doesn't hold us anymore.

253
00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:02.595
That you don't have to sin anymore. You don't have to.

254
00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:05.115
If you're in Christ who's freed you from that

255
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:08.475
and he overcame that, you don't have to do it anymore.

256
00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:14.475
He has victory over sin. It doesn't hold us anymore.

257
00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:20.495
Yet, if you remember the passage, we still have

258
00:14:20.495 --> 00:14:21.535
that pesky flesh

259
00:14:21.535 --> 00:14:25.175
and blood problem we saw in one Corinthians 15 that

260
00:14:25.715 --> 00:14:27.755
were perishable or mortal.

261
00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:32.375
We can't inherit the kingdom in that way,

262
00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:36.425
which is why the other part

263
00:14:36.425 --> 00:14:39.545
of the solution here is Christ's victory over death

264
00:14:40.445 --> 00:14:43.585
as well is victory over sin.

265
00:14:44.765 --> 00:14:47.345
But his victory over death matters as well.

266
00:14:49.575 --> 00:14:52.605
And we've already seen it. How tightly tied sin

267
00:14:52.605 --> 00:14:54.565
and death were in this passage, right?

268
00:14:54.565 --> 00:14:56.525
It's, it's what I already said, that the sting

269
00:14:56.525 --> 00:14:58.965
of death only comes because of sin.

270
00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:05.645
Yet as as one Corinthians 15 teaches,

271
00:15:06.265 --> 00:15:08.725
if there's not something on the other side of death,

272
00:15:08.795 --> 00:15:10.245
then we're still hopeless.

273
00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:12.165
We're still in our sins.

274
00:15:13.105 --> 00:15:15.765
If he just died, we're still in our sins

275
00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:18.085
because the resurrection hasn't happened.

276
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.685
Nothing is on the other side of death.

277
00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:23.675
Sin has been paid for, but there's no victory over

278
00:15:23.675 --> 00:15:25.795
that final enemy.

279
00:15:25.795 --> 00:15:28.875
That's why Paul wrote this whole chapter. Go read it today.

280
00:15:29.635 --> 00:15:33.195
Sometime this whole chapter, he's teaching

281
00:15:33.195 --> 00:15:35.595
that Christ truly was raised from the dead.

282
00:15:35.855 --> 00:15:38.395
And if he was truly raised from the dead, that means we

283
00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:40.555
who are in him will be raised from the dead too.

284
00:15:41.925 --> 00:15:43.665
We will get new bodies.

285
00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:47.425
I, I, I just, I just can't conceive of that

286
00:15:47.565 --> 00:15:49.345
of course like we can't understand that.

287
00:15:49.485 --> 00:15:54.345
But verse 26 says, the last enemy to be destroyed is death.

288
00:15:56.535 --> 00:16:00.315
And all these other enemies have been put under subjection

289
00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:01.995
to Christ underneath his feet.

290
00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:05.075
The last enemy to be destroyed is death.

291
00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:08.435
And because Christ has been raised first, those

292
00:16:08.455 --> 00:16:11.555
who are in him are guaranteed to follow him.

293
00:16:13.315 --> 00:16:16.215
And I love the picture that Hebrews two paints

294
00:16:16.645 --> 00:16:19.015
regarding this as Hebrews two 14 and 15.

295
00:16:19.075 --> 00:16:20.295
It says, since

296
00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:23.495
therefore the children share in flesh and blood bodies.

297
00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:25.455
He himself

298
00:16:25.615 --> 00:16:29.255
likewise partook of the same things, that

299
00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:33.015
through death he might destroy the one who has the power

300
00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:34.975
of death that is the devil.

301
00:16:35.355 --> 00:16:38.015
And deliver all those who through fear

302
00:16:38.035 --> 00:16:40.575
of death we're subject to lifelong slavery.

303
00:16:42.415 --> 00:16:45.775
'cause remember in sin we should be afraid of death

304
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.375
because it's condemnation.

305
00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:50.525
But Jesus took on flesh

306
00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:51.965
and blood without sin,

307
00:16:52.235 --> 00:16:54.405
took the curse, defeated the enemy of death.

308
00:16:54.465 --> 00:16:56.925
And now we are free from fear of death

309
00:16:58.285 --> 00:17:00.245
'cause it's been beaten.

310
00:17:02.085 --> 00:17:04.385
That's why Paul nearly taunts death.

311
00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:07.905
Go back to one Corinthians 15 verses 54

312
00:17:07.905 --> 00:17:10.505
and 55, he's almost taunting death.

313
00:17:11.535 --> 00:17:13.185
This saying that is written,

314
00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:15.385
death is swallowed up in victory.

315
00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:18.345
Oh, death, where is your victory? Oh, death.

316
00:17:18.355 --> 00:17:21.425
Where is your sting? He's saying death. You loose.

317
00:17:22.845 --> 00:17:26.225
And he's quoting Isaiah 25, he's referencing hose Isaiah 13

318
00:17:26.635 --> 00:17:30.785
where Paul said death was a shroud over humanity.

319
00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:33.225
A sheet that covered all the nations,

320
00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.185
yet God removed it in Christ.

321
00:17:35.205 --> 00:17:37.665
But not only removed it, he also destroyed it.

322
00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:42.415
It was gone absorbing it.

323
00:17:43.555 --> 00:17:45.415
The sting of it, the resurrection,

324
00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:49.285
overcoming it 'cause death, right?

325
00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:50.525
The wages of sin is death.

326
00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:53.645
Death used to be a judgmental consequence for sin.

327
00:17:56.565 --> 00:18:01.495
But in Christ's fulfillment of the law, death now becomes

328
00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:04.695
a gateway into God's presence.

329
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:09.825
And and hear me, I said, he's kind

330
00:18:09.825 --> 00:18:11.145
of taunting, almost singing a song.

331
00:18:11.245 --> 00:18:13.465
No one sings that song. We are the champions.

332
00:18:13.765 --> 00:18:15.625
Unless victory is without doubt

333
00:18:15.685 --> 00:18:20.045
and secured, like you don't, that's not your walkup song

334
00:18:20.605 --> 00:18:22.085
whenever you're about to go to bat, right?

335
00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:23.845
That's not your, you're going into the debate room

336
00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:26.085
and you're like, we are the champion.

337
00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:28.485
Like that's you don't do that. 'cause what if you lose?

338
00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:29.645
Right? You look pretty foolish.

339
00:18:30.945 --> 00:18:33.725
You don't sing that song unless you've already won.

340
00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:42.405
Listen, in our faith, oh man, this gets me in our faith.

341
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:46.485
Every Sunday we sing songs like that

342
00:18:48.755 --> 00:18:50.565
because we're great, because we're awesome

343
00:18:50.805 --> 00:18:51.805
'cause we know we're gonna overcome.

344
00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:54.765
No, because Christ has already won the

345
00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:57.085
victory and we can sing.

346
00:18:57.425 --> 00:19:01.365
We are the champions because of his faithfulness for us.

347
00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:09.915
Do you have that hope? And

348
00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:11.075
do you have this kind of hope?

349
00:19:11.215 --> 00:19:14.555
Can you, can you look at death through this lens

350
00:19:15.975 --> 00:19:17.555
of victorious hope?

351
00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:23.855
Or are you still afraid of death?

352
00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.525
Are you still afraid of Jesus returning

353
00:19:28.915 --> 00:19:31.485
because you don't really know where you stand with him?

354
00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:39.815
Listen, God is faithful and he's

355
00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.655
provided a way for you to, to have this victory,

356
00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:44.055
to share in this victory.

357
00:19:45.715 --> 00:19:47.285
It's Romans 10, nine says,

358
00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:50.045
therefore, if anyone believes in his heart

359
00:19:50.045 --> 00:19:51.645
that God raised him from the dead

360
00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:53.885
and confesses with his mouth

361
00:19:53.885 --> 00:19:56.325
that Jesus is Lord will be saved.

362
00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:04.845
Simple. It's how Paul ended.

363
00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:09.085
Verse 57, thanks be to God who gives us the victory

364
00:20:09.085 --> 00:20:10.325
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

365
00:20:10.345 --> 00:20:11.805
We didn't earn it. We can't earn it.

366
00:20:11.805 --> 00:20:14.205
But thanks be to God who gives it

367
00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:17.205
To those who believe.

368
00:20:18.775 --> 00:20:20.155
That's how you can have this hope.

369
00:20:23.975 --> 00:20:28.675
Now we could end there 20 minutes in and just be encouraged

370
00:20:28.675 --> 00:20:30.395
and ready to go and sing and worship

371
00:20:30.575 --> 00:20:32.035
and lift our voices and praise.

372
00:20:32.575 --> 00:20:34.235
But if you remember there was another verse

373
00:20:34.235 --> 00:20:36.155
that I haven't referenced yet, right?

374
00:20:38.315 --> 00:20:39.495
He doesn't stop there.

375
00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:41.695
And this is classic the Apostle Paul,

376
00:20:43.155 --> 00:20:46.685
he's making this incredibly rich theological argument,

377
00:20:48.425 --> 00:20:50.125
but he doesn't keep it just theoretical,

378
00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:53.805
he makes it intensely applicable.

379
00:20:56.575 --> 00:20:59.155
He says, for those who do believe, here's

380
00:20:59.155 --> 00:21:00.395
what your response should be.

381
00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:05.205
So if you believe this, if this is what your hope

382
00:21:05.205 --> 00:21:08.965
and your stance is, this is how you should respond to

383
00:21:09.115 --> 00:21:10.125
that hope.

384
00:21:12.585 --> 00:21:14.625
'cause looking at it, verse 58, he said, what?

385
00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:16.545
What's the first word? Therefore,

386
00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:21.315
in other words, because of all of the gospel truth,

387
00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:24.075
I've just proclaimed all of the resurrection hope

388
00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.675
that I've just explained to you over and over again.

389
00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:30.155
All of that, the victory in Christ.

390
00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:34.065
Therefore be steadfast,

391
00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:38.705
immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.

392
00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:42.705
Knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain

393
00:21:44.515 --> 00:21:48.935
in the Lord, in that victorious Lord, this is what we do.

394
00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:52.965
So here's the first response He says.

395
00:21:53.865 --> 00:21:58.765
He says, stand steadfastly in light of all

396
00:21:58.765 --> 00:22:00.405
of this, in light of the victory in Christ.

397
00:22:00.425 --> 00:22:05.325
He says, stand steadfastly, be steadfast, immovable.

398
00:22:06.515 --> 00:22:09.405
He's talking about the veracity, the truthfulness

399
00:22:09.905 --> 00:22:13.605
of our faith, the orthodoxy of our truths that we believe,

400
00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:14.725
we stand on it.

401
00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:18.805
It's a value we have anchoring truth, we are anchored by it

402
00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:20.365
and we are holding it fast.

403
00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:24.505
Not only past truths,

404
00:22:24.525 --> 00:22:27.065
but what we'll get later that we're holding fast.

405
00:22:27.155 --> 00:22:31.185
We're steadfast, immovable in that even today.

406
00:22:31.445 --> 00:22:35.385
And there's something about future certainty

407
00:22:36.635 --> 00:22:37.805
that gives you courage today.

408
00:22:38.395 --> 00:22:39.765
Because when you know something's

409
00:22:39.765 --> 00:22:42.165
coming, it gives you courage.

410
00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:45.395
Today, I can just imagine this,

411
00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:48.515
it doesn't really fit based on yesterday,

412
00:22:48.515 --> 00:22:50.355
but imagine you recorded the thunder game

413
00:22:53.895 --> 00:22:56.635
and you were gonna watch it later

414
00:22:56.635 --> 00:22:57.995
because you're gonna be busy, you're gonna be at

415
00:22:57.995 --> 00:22:59.075
your kid's game or whatever it is.

416
00:22:59.075 --> 00:23:00.115
And you wonder, watch it later.

417
00:23:02.855 --> 00:23:05.115
And it's hard as you try to avoid it.

418
00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:06.755
Someone let the cat outta

419
00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:07.795
the bag that they had won the game.

420
00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:09.955
You are a little frustrated with that person.

421
00:23:10.195 --> 00:23:11.195
'cause you wanted to watch it later, but

422
00:23:11.215 --> 00:23:12.155
but you see the point, right?

423
00:23:12.175 --> 00:23:14.235
So you'd recorded it, you don't know what's happened.

424
00:23:14.455 --> 00:23:17.635
But then you know now before you watch it, that they had won

425
00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:20.515
and, and when you turn that game on later to watch it,

426
00:23:20.515 --> 00:23:21.995
imagine how you would watch it

427
00:23:23.915 --> 00:23:25.155
A little bit differently, right?

428
00:23:27.015 --> 00:23:30.715
You would watch it probably a little calmer.

429
00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.395
You wouldn't be as worried about that mis shot

430
00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:38.675
or that missed rebound or whatever it was You.

431
00:23:38.725 --> 00:23:41.355
You'd notice details about the game

432
00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:43.235
that you wouldn't have otherwise.

433
00:23:44.855 --> 00:23:49.125
And you would, you would know that you don't have any fear

434
00:23:49.855 --> 00:23:50.885
about what might come.

435
00:23:52.545 --> 00:23:56.815
Why? Because the outcome has already been guaranteed.

436
00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:01.835
So church, listen, we know

437
00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:05.355
that Christ has secured the victory

438
00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:08.075
for us over sin and death.

439
00:24:08.135 --> 00:24:11.115
And he said those who believe in him will also receive

440
00:24:11.305 --> 00:24:13.155
that victory over sin and death.

441
00:24:13.245 --> 00:24:14.675
There is no fear.

442
00:24:14.975 --> 00:24:16.235
So listen, what do we have

443
00:24:16.235 --> 00:24:18.115
to worry about today during the game?

444
00:24:20.905 --> 00:24:23.315
Like why do I get so stressed out about

445
00:24:23.315 --> 00:24:24.995
how things are gonna work out now

446
00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:27.035
and if this is gonna happen or that's gonna happen?

447
00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:28.915
Why do I wonder about the missed shots

448
00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:30.075
that happen in my life?

449
00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:31.395
Like why do I wonder about that?

450
00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:36.025
'cause I already know the end. We can

451
00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:37.065
be steadfast.

452
00:24:37.205 --> 00:24:39.185
That's what he says, right? Steadfast,

453
00:24:39.615 --> 00:24:41.425
immovable, unshakeable.

454
00:24:41.425 --> 00:24:43.545
Which means we can take tough news,

455
00:24:46.015 --> 00:24:50.915
we can face a lost job, we can face a difficult

456
00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:54.995
diagnosis, Yet stand

457
00:24:55.465 --> 00:24:56.675
Steadfast on Christ.

458
00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:02.645
And that's not just in our beliefs, like in our mental,

459
00:25:02.955 --> 00:25:04.965
okay, yes, I know I'm still believing in this.

460
00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:06.805
I still believe in this. And that's not just there.

461
00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:10.485
That's in our lives too. That's in daily life.

462
00:25:10.485 --> 00:25:11.605
That's in our actions

463
00:25:11.605 --> 00:25:14.565
because look at what else Christ's victory brings.

464
00:25:14.745 --> 00:25:16.085
He says, yes, steadfast

465
00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:19.645
and movable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.

466
00:25:20.855 --> 00:25:23.865
Knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.

467
00:25:25.925 --> 00:25:28.545
So we respond to what he has done

468
00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:30.185
and what he will do

469
00:25:33.295 --> 00:25:35.115
by serving sacrificially,

470
00:25:37.595 --> 00:25:42.455
we stand steadfastly, beliefs, thought, process, faith.

471
00:25:42.515 --> 00:25:44.415
We stand on the rock of Christ

472
00:25:44.635 --> 00:25:49.015
and we serve sacrificially, we abound in it.

473
00:25:49.035 --> 00:25:52.735
He says, where we overflow with service

474
00:25:53.925 --> 00:25:57.455
because of the gospel, because of the resurrection.

475
00:26:00.415 --> 00:26:02.785
It's similar to what Paul wrote elsewhere.

476
00:26:02.785 --> 00:26:05.305
This is Ephesians two, chapter 10.

477
00:26:05.405 --> 00:26:08.505
He just explained the gospel of what God does

478
00:26:08.505 --> 00:26:09.825
to bring from death to life.

479
00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:12.225
Ephesians two 10 then says, for

480
00:26:12.735 --> 00:26:14.745
meaning like kinda same thing, connected.

481
00:26:14.845 --> 00:26:19.145
We are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus

482
00:26:19.605 --> 00:26:23.265
for good works, which God prepared beforehand

483
00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:25.905
that we should walk in them

484
00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:28.625
again because of the gospel.

485
00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:30.825
Because you've been made new in Christ.

486
00:26:31.445 --> 00:26:33.785
You have work to do.

487
00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:37.405
But what does that even mean? Like what?

488
00:26:37.405 --> 00:26:40.405
What does he mean by good works? He's prepared for us.

489
00:26:40.405 --> 00:26:42.685
What does it mean to serve sacrificially?

490
00:26:44.285 --> 00:26:46.775
Well, don't overcomplicate it.

491
00:26:48.395 --> 00:26:51.335
It means anything that scripture commands us to do.

492
00:26:53.835 --> 00:26:56.495
It means anything that matches the character of God.

493
00:26:56.755 --> 00:27:01.285
For us, it's anything that is truly loving

494
00:27:01.585 --> 00:27:03.605
and good, that is serving,

495
00:27:04.555 --> 00:27:07.805
that is abounding in the work of the Lord.

496
00:27:10.935 --> 00:27:12.765
Could go through infinite examples,

497
00:27:12.765 --> 00:27:15.325
but just here one, think of orphan care.

498
00:27:19.255 --> 00:27:21.085
There are categories of people in scripture

499
00:27:21.085 --> 00:27:25.285
that are very close to God's heart, widows

500
00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:27.605
and orphans and the outcast,

501
00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:33.405
orphans, vulnerable are close to God's heart.

502
00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:37.205
And so how can we abound in that good work?

503
00:27:37.275 --> 00:27:39.605
Well, one modern way is fostering

504
00:27:42.705 --> 00:27:44.755
that we can meet those needs of the orphans.

505
00:27:44.755 --> 00:27:46.315
Yet here's, here's just a statistic.

506
00:27:46.435 --> 00:27:49.035
In Oklahoma County, our county here,

507
00:27:49.035 --> 00:27:51.915
there are 931 children in foster placements.

508
00:27:51.975 --> 00:27:54.475
But only 524 foster homes.

509
00:27:56.785 --> 00:27:59.715
There's 400 children more than there are homes.

510
00:27:59.715 --> 00:28:02.075
There are also way more children waiting for

511
00:28:02.595 --> 00:28:04.875
adoption than there are adoptive families.

512
00:28:06.855 --> 00:28:11.555
Now the reality is not all of us will get involved directly

513
00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:14.275
like that, but everyone can help.

514
00:28:17.245 --> 00:28:18.745
Here's the truth. Historically,

515
00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:21.265
churches have been strongly against abortion.

516
00:28:22.405 --> 00:28:25.505
But are we going to be as strongly for adoption

517
00:28:26.045 --> 00:28:27.305
as we are as that way?

518
00:28:29.515 --> 00:28:33.765
Like, are we gonna choose life in that sense just as much?

519
00:28:37.745 --> 00:28:41.365
So there's one way orphan care, figure it out James 1 27,

520
00:28:41.705 --> 00:28:43.325
how we can care for the widows

521
00:28:43.325 --> 00:28:44.845
and orphans like that very directly.

522
00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:46.765
And that's close to the heart of God.

523
00:28:46.795 --> 00:28:49.525
It's real religion in that sense.

524
00:28:52.225 --> 00:28:54.365
But then here, here's another thought.

525
00:28:54.575 --> 00:28:56.365
Let's take this even to parenting in general.

526
00:28:56.365 --> 00:28:59.125
What, what are these serving sacrificially great, uh,

527
00:28:59.435 --> 00:29:01.645
good works abounding in the work of the Lord, even

528
00:29:01.645 --> 00:29:03.125
to parenting in it's mother's day.

529
00:29:03.145 --> 00:29:05.405
So let's just think about that for a a second.

530
00:29:05.565 --> 00:29:09.285
I, I think especially moms are tempted to think

531
00:29:09.285 --> 00:29:10.605
that their labor is in vain.

532
00:29:12.875 --> 00:29:14.745
Think of that mom of teenagers

533
00:29:15.565 --> 00:29:17.625
who just feels like every day is a failure

534
00:29:18.375 --> 00:29:19.375
With them.

535
00:29:22.335 --> 00:29:24.275
Or I think of a mom at home with her little kids

536
00:29:24.335 --> 00:29:25.595
and it feels like Groundhog Day.

537
00:29:25.595 --> 00:29:27.875
Whereas just cleaning up and feeding and cleaning up

538
00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:29.555
and feeding and,

539
00:29:29.555 --> 00:29:32.595
and it feels like there's no eternal impact you're actually

540
00:29:32.595 --> 00:29:34.075
making with these little ones

541
00:29:38.015 --> 00:29:41.155
or a single mom feeling completely overwhelmed

542
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.395
and feeling like her kids are missing out

543
00:29:43.455 --> 00:29:44.635
on a lot of things in life.

544
00:29:49.295 --> 00:29:51.675
Or even, I know Mother's Day can be hard in unique ways.

545
00:29:51.835 --> 00:29:56.535
I think of maybe your mom has gone kind

546
00:29:56.535 --> 00:29:59.295
of haywire and you're doing your best to love her well,

547
00:30:00.515 --> 00:30:03.095
but it just doesn't seem like anything is getting

548
00:30:03.095 --> 00:30:04.095
Through.

549
00:30:06.215 --> 00:30:07.715
Listen, any of that

550
00:30:07.735 --> 00:30:10.555
and so much more if it's done in the Lord,

551
00:30:12.555 --> 00:30:14.605
like if you're standing on the power

552
00:30:14.865 --> 00:30:17.365
of the victorious resurrection for his glory

553
00:30:17.365 --> 00:30:18.965
and you're doing it all for that,

554
00:30:19.315 --> 00:30:23.045
then it is not in vain, none of it.

555
00:30:25.385 --> 00:30:26.965
No one else may see that you're doing it.

556
00:30:27.115 --> 00:30:30.405
It's not in vain because it's in the Lord

557
00:30:30.425 --> 00:30:33.045
and it's the good works abounding in those works

558
00:30:34.585 --> 00:30:36.765
for the Lord because of what he's done for you.

559
00:30:39.165 --> 00:30:41.235
Again, that's why we can't forget the problem

560
00:30:41.345 --> 00:30:42.955
that we all have

561
00:30:43.865 --> 00:30:46.435
that on our own in this state.

562
00:30:46.615 --> 00:30:49.155
We are limited. These dying bodies cannot

563
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:50.835
inherit the kingdom of God.

564
00:30:50.895 --> 00:30:52.715
We can't make it there on our own.

565
00:30:52.935 --> 00:30:55.555
But we can't forget at the same time what God has done.

566
00:30:57.835 --> 00:30:59.105
Lemme just think about this.

567
00:30:59.485 --> 00:31:00.785
The king of the kingdom,

568
00:31:01.565 --> 00:31:05.265
the infinite one took on flesh and blood.

569
00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:10.025
The imperishable one became perishable on our behalf.

570
00:31:11.085 --> 00:31:14.305
The immortal one became mortal on behalf

571
00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:17.705
of the sinner he wanted to save, to absorb the sin

572
00:31:17.725 --> 00:31:20.185
and death that we were deserving.

573
00:31:20.365 --> 00:31:22.785
And he took it on himself instead.

574
00:31:23.255 --> 00:31:26.985
That is why we can remain unswervingly committed

575
00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:30.905
to the truth and we can remain totally dedicated to the work

576
00:31:30.905 --> 00:31:32.985
of the gospel no matter the cost

577
00:31:33.055 --> 00:31:35.585
because God has won already.

578
00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:39.985
And listen, we're gonna get to praise him in a moment.

579
00:31:39.995 --> 00:31:43.025
We're gonna get to sing in light of these truths.

580
00:31:43.045 --> 00:31:44.985
But what a blessing this is, right?

581
00:31:45.175 --> 00:31:46.825
What a blessing this passage is.

582
00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:51.975
Should this not stir something within us

583
00:31:54.975 --> 00:31:57.395
to rejoice, to sing loud,

584
00:31:58.695 --> 00:32:01.115
to speak boldly out there, to live

585
00:32:01.755 --> 00:32:03.115
sacrificially in everything we do

586
00:32:03.375 --> 00:32:05.555
and especially to look forward

587
00:32:05.935 --> 00:32:07.915
to the day he's coming back for us.

588
00:32:10.265 --> 00:32:14.115
Just think about it. Oh, death. Where is your sting?

589
00:32:16.095 --> 00:32:18.515
Oh, death. Where is your victory?

590
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:24.295
Well, thanks be to God who gives us the victory

591
00:32:24.365 --> 00:32:26.135
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
