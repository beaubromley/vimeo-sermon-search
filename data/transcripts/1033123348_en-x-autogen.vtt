WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:19.845
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.045
Uh, my name is John, one of the pastors here.

3
00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.125
I get the privilege of preaching most Sundays.

4
00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:25.405
It's an honor to do that.

5
00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:27.565
If you're new to our church, we wanna say welcome,

6
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:28.645
especially to you.

7
00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.765
Love to meet you. Uh, come say hi to us.

8
00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.685
There's a new here area out there as well.

9
00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:35.365
I just want to get to know you

10
00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:38.485
as best we can help you connect here, uh, in those ways.

11
00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:41.125
And as always, if you're here all the time,

12
00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:42.245
call Henderson Hills home.

13
00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.005
It's great to see you as well. We love you.

14
00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.125
Uh, let's get to worship together every week.

15
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.165
What a privilege. And as we continue our journey

16
00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.245
through the Old Testament book of one Samuel,

17
00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:52.805
lemme invite you to take your copy of it

18
00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:58.045
and turn to one Samuel Chapter 16 today, one Samuel 16 is

19
00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.965
where we're gonna be in our study today,

20
00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:06.285
asking God to work through his word to transform us.

21
00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:09.965
One Samuel 16. As you turn there, think about this.

22
00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:11.005
Maybe you've heard the phrase,

23
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.405
don't judge a book by its cover.

24
00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:16.585
Probably most of us have.

25
00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:19.705
Maybe your grandma said that growing up a lot. I don't know.

26
00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.585
But it's a truism that points to the fact

27
00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:25.025
that you shouldn't just look at the outside,

28
00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:27.625
what you see initially of a person.

29
00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:30.145
You need to look deeper and beyond the surface

30
00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:31.905
into somebody's life.

31
00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:34.785
We don't know the source of that,

32
00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.905
but lemme give you one possible source.

33
00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:41.305
It's from our text actually today, one Samuel 16,

34
00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:44.905
verse seven, man looks on the outward appearance,

35
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.105
but the Lord looks at the heart,

36
00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.125
man looks on the outward appearance,

37
00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:52.405
but the Lord looks on the heart.

38
00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:55.385
Maybe that's the source, maybe not.

39
00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:57.505
But what we've learned as we've walked

40
00:01:57.505 --> 00:02:01.225
through the first half of this book of First Samuel, is

41
00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:04.665
that the first king of Israel, Saul, we know now

42
00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:06.025
that his heart was not in it.

43
00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:09.075
He looked the part, but on the inside,

44
00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:10.555
his heart was not in it.

45
00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:12.915
And because his heart was not toward the Lord,

46
00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.115
God rejected him as the king

47
00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:21.235
because what God wanted, we see it there in chapter 16,

48
00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:23.395
verse seven, but, but we also saw it back in

49
00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:25.155
chapter 13, verse 14.

50
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:27.875
What God wanted was that the Lord had sought out a man

51
00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:29.035
after his own heart.

52
00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:34.575
Like more than sacrifices, more than religious actions.

53
00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:38.375
What God wanted was a person's heart.

54
00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:43.305
God wants someone who

55
00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:46.095
is oriented toward him.

56
00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:50.755
He wants someone who is seeking to obey him.

57
00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.875
Because if you remember, that was the base level

58
00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:56.035
for the kings of Israel.

59
00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.245
Their heart was to be oriented towards God.

60
00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:01.725
Their heart was to be wanting to obey God.

61
00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:03.405
It wouldn't work any other way.

62
00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:07.845
They could be a king, but it wouldn't actually work.

63
00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:14.505
The narrative today, chapter 16, will show us

64
00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.025
how God sought out Saul's replacement.

65
00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:23.925
How God sought a man known for pursuing

66
00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:28.975
God's heart, for leading

67
00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.095
others to do the same.

68
00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.975
That that's what God was wil for.

69
00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:33.215
That's what God was wanting.

70
00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:37.705
And so we'll see that today in First Samuel 16.

71
00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:39.185
Now, if you're familiar with your Bible at all,

72
00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:43.865
you might be aware that chapter 17 is the familiar David

73
00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:45.385
and Goliath narrative.

74
00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:49.185
We're actually gonna take a break after today

75
00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:51.585
and we'll pick back up with that story.

76
00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:53.505
First Samuel 17, after the first of the year,

77
00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:55.785
we're gonna do some Christmas things here in between.

78
00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:59.185
But first Samuel 17 is David and Goliath.

79
00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:03.265
Now there's a debate when you study the research

80
00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:04.785
about this passage.

81
00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:07.545
There's a debate about which chapter

82
00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.425
in chronological order actually happened.

83
00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:14.495
First, some people would say that chapter 17, David

84
00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:16.895
and Goliath was actually the first thing that happened.

85
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.015
And then what we'll see today in chapter 16,

86
00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:21.455
where David is anointed as king

87
00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:24.535
and David is entering into Saul's service.

88
00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:25.935
That actually happened after.

89
00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.255
There's some convincing arguments to that.

90
00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:29.455
I don't know exactly,

91
00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:31.455
but the question would be is why

92
00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:32.495
would they have reversed it?

93
00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:35.895
Why would the author narrator have reversed

94
00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:37.175
these two events?

95
00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:40.775
Why did he put this part first

96
00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:43.335
where David will will show up on the scene?

97
00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.415
David will serve in salt. Like why that?

98
00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:52.055
Because it highlights how important it was that God was

99
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:55.475
with David, because that

100
00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:58.815
is the marker of David's life.

101
00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:01.235
The whole journey through first

102
00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:04.995
and second Samuel we'll see is that David was marked

103
00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:08.275
by the presence of God his entire life,

104
00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:15.145
which also, by the way, sets up a contrast here with Saul.

105
00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:19.955
It's been the whole book, but this especially will show

106
00:05:20.235 --> 00:05:21.755
us that contrast.

107
00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:24.485
So whether it happened one way

108
00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:27.165
or the other, you'll see why it happened in

109
00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:28.245
the text this way.

110
00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:30.445
So let's look back historically.

111
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.445
First I wanna read the whole of chapter 16

112
00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:34.765
because it helps us understand

113
00:05:34.765 --> 00:05:36.485
how this whole thing works out together.

114
00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:39.445
But as I read, we finally meet a new character

115
00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:41.165
that we've been waiting for the whole time.

116
00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:44.835
You'll see it here, first Samuel chapter 16.

117
00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:48.425
The Lord said to Samuel,

118
00:05:48.645 --> 00:05:52.025
how long will you grieve over Saul since I've rejected him

119
00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:54.265
from being king over Israel?

120
00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:55.665
That happened in chapter 15 right

121
00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:58.935
before this, fill your horn with oil

122
00:05:58.935 --> 00:06:01.775
and go, I'll send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite for I've

123
00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:04.455
provided for myself a king among his sons.

124
00:06:05.795 --> 00:06:07.935
And Samuel said, how can I go if Saul

125
00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.015
hears that he'll kill me?

126
00:06:10.315 --> 00:06:11.775
The Lord said, take a heifer with you

127
00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:13.815
and say, I've come to sacrifice to the Lord.

128
00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:15.775
Invite Jesse to the sacrifice

129
00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:17.295
and I'll show you what you shall do.

130
00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:21.005
You shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you.

131
00:06:22.255 --> 00:06:24.715
So Samuel did what the Lord commanded came to Bethlehem.

132
00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:27.635
The elders of the city came to meet him, trembling

133
00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.835
and saiddo, you come peaceably

134
00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:31.035
'cause he could have been bringing judgment.

135
00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:35.075
And he said, peaceably, I've come to sacrifice to the Lord.

136
00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:38.085
Consecrate yourselves. Come with me to the sacrifice.

137
00:06:38.855 --> 00:06:39.915
He consecrated. Jesse

138
00:06:39.975 --> 00:06:42.155
and his sons invited them to the sacrifice.

139
00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:44.435
And when they came, he looked on Elia,

140
00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:45.955
that was Jesse's oldest son.

141
00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:48.035
He looked on Elia and thought, well,

142
00:06:48.035 --> 00:06:49.555
surely the Lord's anointed us before him.

143
00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:53.885
But the Lord said to Samuel, do not look on his appearance

144
00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:56.965
or on the height of his stature because I've rejected him.

145
00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:58.485
For the Lord sees not

146
00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:01.045
as man sees man looks on the outward appearance,

147
00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:03.085
but the Lord looks on the heart.

148
00:07:04.765 --> 00:07:07.175
Then Jesse called a beda his second son

149
00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:08.815
and made him pass before Samuel.

150
00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:10.775
And he said, neither has the Lord chosen this one.

151
00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:14.615
And then Jesse made Shama, the third son passed by

152
00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:17.135
and he said, neither has the Lord chosen this one.

153
00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:21.245
And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel

154
00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:26.385
and Samuel said to Jesse, the Lord has not chosen these.

155
00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:31.305
And Samuel said to Jesse, are all your sons here?

156
00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:35.515
And he said, well, there remains the youngest

157
00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:38.155
that can also be translated smallest,

158
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.725
but behold, he is keeping the sheep.

159
00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:44.445
Samuel said to Jesse, send and get him.

160
00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:46.125
We will not sit down until he comes here.

161
00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.045
And he sent and brought him in.

162
00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:52.285
Now he was ruddy, reddish, colored, and had beautiful eyes

163
00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:53.645
and was handsome.

164
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:58.525
And the Lord said, arise, anoint him for this is he.

165
00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:01.035
Samuel took the horn of oil

166
00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:02.795
and anointed him in the midst of his brothers.

167
00:08:03.175 --> 00:08:05.795
And the spirit of the Lord rushed upon David

168
00:08:07.065 --> 00:08:08.075
from that day forward.

169
00:08:08.575 --> 00:08:10.475
And Samuel Rose up and went to Rama.

170
00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:15.635
Now, verse 14, now the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul

171
00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:18.485
and a harmful spirit from the Lord tormented him.

172
00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:20.965
And Saul's servants said to him, behold,

173
00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:23.165
now a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you.

174
00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:25.285
Let our Lord now command your servants who are

175
00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:26.765
before you to seek out a man

176
00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:29.685
who is skillful in playing the liar or the harp.

177
00:08:30.505 --> 00:08:32.325
And when the harmful spirit from God is

178
00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:33.365
upon you, he'll play it.

179
00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:36.745
You'll be well. So Saul said to his servants, provide

180
00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:38.665
for me a man who can play well and bring him to me.

181
00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:40.745
And one of the young men answered.

182
00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:42.585
Behold, I've seen a son of Jesse,

183
00:08:42.725 --> 00:08:46.625
the Bethlehemite who's skillful in playing a man of valor,

184
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:49.665
man of war, prudent in speech, a man of good presence,

185
00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:51.305
and the Lord is with him.

186
00:08:52.605 --> 00:08:54.855
Therefore, Saul sent messenger to Jesse, said,

187
00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:56.525
send me David, your son who's with the sheep.

188
00:08:57.205 --> 00:08:59.715
Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine.

189
00:08:59.795 --> 00:09:02.475
A young goat sent them by David to his, by David,

190
00:09:02.535 --> 00:09:03.715
his son to Saul.

191
00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:05.995
David came to Saul, entered his service.

192
00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:10.195
Saul loved him greatly and he became his armor bearer.

193
00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:12.925
And Saul sent to Jesse saying,

194
00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.405
let David remain in my service.

195
00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:16.205
He's found favor in my sight.

196
00:09:17.465 --> 00:09:19.545
Whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul,

197
00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:21.545
David took the liar and played it with his hand.

198
00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:23.705
And Saul was refreshed, was well.

199
00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:26.145
The harmful spirit departed from him.

200
00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:30.205
God, there is a lot here.

201
00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:32.045
But we know, Lord, it's your word

202
00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:35.125
and you want to speak to us through it.

203
00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:39.035
Show us something clearly today that we need

204
00:09:39.035 --> 00:09:41.075
to know about you, that we need to know about ourselves,

205
00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:42.275
that we need to know about the world.

206
00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:47.365
God, we want to be more like you.

207
00:09:47.415 --> 00:09:50.205
Jesus, help us through your word.

208
00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:52.125
Holy spirit, you have to work

209
00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:54.405
or this will be fruitless today.

210
00:09:55.695 --> 00:10:00.265
Speak to us in Jesus authority we pray. Amen.

211
00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:05.225
So again, one of the key points highlighted here,

212
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:06.985
you saw it in the narrative, was

213
00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:09.545
that God gave his spirit to David.

214
00:10:10.445 --> 00:10:12.345
That's pretty much the main point

215
00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:14.945
of the first half at least.

216
00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:17.385
But God gave his spirit to David.

217
00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:20.385
'cause if you remember, the presence

218
00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:23.265
of God was the key distinguishing mark

219
00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:24.945
for the kings of Israel.

220
00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:29.635
That was to be primary. He God was to be primary in

221
00:10:29.635 --> 00:10:30.995
that king's life.

222
00:10:32.535 --> 00:10:34.715
And we'll deal with Saul later. We'll come back to that.

223
00:10:34.815 --> 00:10:38.235
But but the first half of the chapter, the aim of it is

224
00:10:38.235 --> 00:10:41.035
to highlight that it was God who selected David

225
00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:44.055
and that God was with David.

226
00:10:44.065 --> 00:10:46.975
Right? That's the whole point here is it's showing us

227
00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:48.615
that David is now the one.

228
00:10:50.565 --> 00:10:52.265
But it's such an interesting narrative, isn't it?

229
00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:54.065
Because you, you track through this

230
00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:55.465
and it takes a long time.

231
00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:57.545
Just imagine you were reading this for the first time,

232
00:10:58.135 --> 00:10:59.425
know nothing else about it.

233
00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:00.545
You're reading through it

234
00:11:00.725 --> 00:11:03.145
and it takes you a long time to discover who

235
00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:04.745
that new king finally will be, right?

236
00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:09.445
'cause Samuel, he had to go to this back woods,

237
00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:11.405
forgotten town named Bethlehem.

238
00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:14.445
He had to deal with the elders who were afraid

239
00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:15.525
of him to begin with.

240
00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:20.295
And then he had to go through this parade of seven

241
00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:23.295
of Jesse's sons, one after another.

242
00:11:23.295 --> 00:11:25.775
Like it, it feels like some kind of pageant here

243
00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:28.215
or something where, where it's like they got a talent

244
00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:30.615
portion and an interview portion, which by the way,

245
00:11:30.615 --> 00:11:32.855
if it's an interview portion, he answered that question.

246
00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:35.815
Perfect date with April 25th, right? That's a guarantee.

247
00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:39.215
Like 20 of you have seen that movie. Okay, sorry.

248
00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:43.345
Um, anyway, but those seven

249
00:11:43.345 --> 00:11:46.065
that he tracked through, they were all in.

250
00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:49.075
Oh, so they had to go find the runt

251
00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.915
of the litter out there with the sheep.

252
00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:55.995
But even then they bring that kid in

253
00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:57.595
and even then, we don't know his name.

254
00:11:57.595 --> 00:11:58.555
We don't even know if he's a kid

255
00:11:58.555 --> 00:11:59.555
or if he's old, we don't know.

256
00:11:59.775 --> 00:12:02.875
But even then, we don't know his name till the whole process

257
00:12:03.135 --> 00:12:04.395
is finally completed.

258
00:12:05.845 --> 00:12:07.815
They're anointed him and all this stuff happening.

259
00:12:07.815 --> 00:12:10.295
And we don't know it until the very end.

260
00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:14.965
But that was intentional because the author

261
00:12:14.965 --> 00:12:17.685
wanted to keep the reader's attention on

262
00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:19.565
what was most important here.

263
00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:25.325
God's presence was with him. That was critical.

264
00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:27.725
If they would've said David from the very beginning,

265
00:12:28.035 --> 00:12:31.045
most people reading this later would've had all the things

266
00:12:31.045 --> 00:12:32.125
about David in their mind.

267
00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:34.445
They would've not known anything other

268
00:12:34.445 --> 00:12:35.525
than what they knew then.

269
00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:39.965
This is intentional. God's presence is primary.

270
00:12:44.425 --> 00:12:45.885
But what I want us to notice here

271
00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:47.965
as we think about God's presence,

272
00:12:47.965 --> 00:12:49.885
that this is highlighting David as the new King.

273
00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:54.365
Notice how clearly God makes the point that this selection

274
00:12:54.365 --> 00:12:55.765
of David as the new king

275
00:12:56.505 --> 00:12:58.765
was completely contrary to circumstances.

276
00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:03.935
Like completely contrary to every circumstance.

277
00:13:04.315 --> 00:13:07.535
You can imagine that they would've selected a king by

278
00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:13.235
again, this forgotten, sleepy town,

279
00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:18.625
this less than prominent family within that forgotten town.

280
00:13:21.005 --> 00:13:22.905
And then the youngest son,

281
00:13:23.005 --> 00:13:25.345
or at least the smallest son

282
00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:30.115
who wasn't even considered an option by his dad.

283
00:13:30.655 --> 00:13:33.395
You notice that Samuel goes to Jesse,

284
00:13:33.535 --> 00:13:34.795
Hey Jesse, bring your sons in.

285
00:13:34.795 --> 00:13:39.235
We're gonna pick a king. Okay, great. Here are my sons.

286
00:13:41.975 --> 00:13:44.015
No, you got any more?

287
00:13:45.035 --> 00:13:47.855
Oh yeah, I remember we got his son out in the

288
00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:48.895
sheep fold, right?

289
00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:50.015
Like, I forgot we,

290
00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:51.975
so it's like not even an op didn't even

291
00:13:51.975 --> 00:13:53.175
bring him in to begin with.

292
00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:56.885
That's how forgotten. That's how contrary

293
00:13:57.025 --> 00:13:58.925
to the circumstances it was.

294
00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:03.565
But again, that was intentional by God to prove to us

295
00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:06.165
that it's not about the way we see things,

296
00:14:06.675 --> 00:14:08.405
it's about the way God sees things.

297
00:14:11.315 --> 00:14:13.125
It's exactly what God said to Samuel.

298
00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:17.505
Jesse parades his first son by him.

299
00:14:17.595 --> 00:14:18.985
Verse seven, what did it say?

300
00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:22.545
God says, do not look at his appearance

301
00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:25.425
or on the height of his stature because I've rejected him.

302
00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:28.145
For the Lord sees not as man sees,

303
00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:29.985
man looks on the outward appearance,

304
00:14:30.165 --> 00:14:32.345
but the Lord looks on the heart.

305
00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:37.095
And this contrast between Saul and David

306
00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:39.215
and the way the people work, the way God works,

307
00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:43.695
it's even more clear when you think back to

308
00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:46.295
how Saul was identified

309
00:14:46.555 --> 00:14:48.815
as he was anointed as the king.

310
00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:51.525
You remember that? What'd they say?

311
00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:54.055
He's taller than everybody else.

312
00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:02.425
That's, that's it. Like, yeah, that's pretty much it.

313
00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:04.705
He was head and shoulders taller than everybody.

314
00:15:04.725 --> 00:15:06.825
So they're like, that's the king right there. We know it.

315
00:15:08.655 --> 00:15:10.105
What? That doesn't make any sense, right?

316
00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:12.945
It'd be like if you would call a pastor to a church just

317
00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.865
because you like listening to his voice.

318
00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:17.755
Don't, I don't care what he says,

319
00:15:17.955 --> 00:15:19.035
I don't care his character.

320
00:15:19.395 --> 00:15:22.275
I love listening to his like that. That doesn't fly right?

321
00:15:24.295 --> 00:15:26.075
But that's what they did.

322
00:15:26.515 --> 00:15:27.915
Remember what they were wanting a king

323
00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:29.115
for in the first place?

324
00:15:29.865 --> 00:15:32.475
They wanted a king because they were afraid

325
00:15:32.895 --> 00:15:34.435
and they wanted to be like everybody else.

326
00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:36.155
They wanted somebody to lead him into battle.

327
00:15:36.495 --> 00:15:39.675
So the biggest, tallest, strongest guy made sense.

328
00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:43.785
But how did that work out for him?

329
00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:47.855
But you see that that was the drive was

330
00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:50.215
to look at the way we think it should go.

331
00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:52.295
This is, this has gotta be the way it works.

332
00:15:52.725 --> 00:15:55.695
Look, he's bigger and taller. He's stronger.

333
00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.495
He's gonna be our victor.

334
00:16:01.415 --> 00:16:02.675
But notice who God picked.

335
00:16:06.035 --> 00:16:07.615
It was David who was anointed king.

336
00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:11.135
It was David who was given God's presence

337
00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:18.085
contrary to his size, contrary to his birth order,

338
00:16:20.455 --> 00:16:22.415
contrary to the fact that Saul is still the

339
00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:23.775
king at this moment.

340
00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:31.195
David is anointed King. David is given God's presence.

341
00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:35.885
So why was David anointed?

342
00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:38.455
Why did God look at all

343
00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:40.455
of this other stuff, all these other people?

344
00:16:40.555 --> 00:16:42.335
Why did God say, yep, David is the one.

345
00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.835
It's because of David's commitment,

346
00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:51.495
because of David's commitment to the Lord.

347
00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:57.625
It's the sole reason God said. David is the one again.

348
00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:59.385
Verse seven. What did God say there?

349
00:16:59.965 --> 00:17:01.665
Man looks on the outward appearance,

350
00:17:02.005 --> 00:17:04.305
but the Lord looks on the heart.

351
00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:11.895
In other words, God is not concerned about the container.

352
00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:18.345
Here's what I mean by that. He, he's not worried about

353
00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:19.985
what the outside, what the vessel,

354
00:17:20.135 --> 00:17:21.585
what the container looks like.

355
00:17:22.015 --> 00:17:25.585
He's way more concerned about what's on the inside of

356
00:17:25.585 --> 00:17:27.655
that container, right?

357
00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:31.055
This is all over Second Corinthians chapter four when Paul

358
00:17:31.055 --> 00:17:32.815
talks about we are treasure.

359
00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:37.305
We have treasure in jars of clay like this

360
00:17:37.955 --> 00:17:40.785
unassuming really kind

361
00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:43.585
of fragile weird jar.

362
00:17:45.475 --> 00:17:46.975
It doesn't matter what that thing's like,

363
00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.295
because what matters is what's on the

364
00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:49.565
inside of that, of that jar.

365
00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:52.685
The treasure inside the jar of clay.

366
00:17:54.145 --> 00:17:55.815
God's not worried about the container.

367
00:17:55.955 --> 00:17:59.335
He doesn't really care about the the authority or

368
00:17:59.715 --> 00:18:02.855
or background or propensity towards

369
00:18:02.855 --> 00:18:03.975
this or abilities here and there.

370
00:18:03.975 --> 00:18:05.455
It doesn't, it's not a big deal to him.

371
00:18:05.455 --> 00:18:08.855
He's much more worried about what's on the inside.

372
00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:12.695
Because if you remember what we saw last week with Saul,

373
00:18:15.905 --> 00:18:19.695
we saw that it is, even if you try

374
00:18:19.695 --> 00:18:24.405
to dress up the container, you try

375
00:18:24.405 --> 00:18:26.205
to wash it, you try to cover it, you try

376
00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:29.125
to make it look pretty, you religiously cover up

377
00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:30.445
the blemishes on it.

378
00:18:30.825 --> 00:18:33.525
You try to do anything that's going

379
00:18:33.525 --> 00:18:35.645
to make other people feel like it's beautiful,

380
00:18:36.305 --> 00:18:37.525
it, it will not work.

381
00:18:37.545 --> 00:18:41.175
God sees right through it. God sees that

382
00:18:41.175 --> 00:18:43.335
that container is actually empty.

383
00:18:47.225 --> 00:18:52.085
He wants what's on the inside more than on the outside.

384
00:18:52.185 --> 00:18:54.725
And with Saul, because he was living like that,

385
00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:56.965
God rejected him because of it.

386
00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:02.345
Again, what was the Lord looking for?

387
00:19:03.565 --> 00:19:05.485
A man after his own heart.

388
00:19:08.675 --> 00:19:10.095
And he found that man in David.

389
00:19:13.215 --> 00:19:17.575
David wasn't perfect, but David wanted the Lord.

390
00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:24.745
David wrote most of the Psalms, majority of the Psalms.

391
00:19:24.795 --> 00:19:28.425
Lemme just give you one example. Psalm 63 verse one.

392
00:19:28.525 --> 00:19:32.655
He says, oh God, you are my God, earnestly,

393
00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:34.015
deeply, strongly.

394
00:19:34.335 --> 00:19:37.575
I seek you my soul thirsts for you.

395
00:19:37.995 --> 00:19:41.055
My flesh faints for you as in a dry

396
00:19:41.155 --> 00:19:43.895
and weary land where there is no water.

397
00:19:44.905 --> 00:19:49.765
You see that again, David wasn't perfect.

398
00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.925
We'll look over the next couple months about David

399
00:19:52.035 --> 00:19:55.805
that he failed some major faith tests in his life.

400
00:19:57.425 --> 00:20:00.325
But what we also learn about David is that he was repentant.

401
00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:05.645
He was turning back to God when he did get off track

402
00:20:06.155 --> 00:20:09.245
because he knew God and he longed for God.

403
00:20:09.345 --> 00:20:12.565
He loved God because God had loved him first.

404
00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:13.845
God anointed him.

405
00:20:14.225 --> 00:20:15.765
God gave him his presence

406
00:20:15.765 --> 00:20:17.685
because of David's commitment to him.

407
00:20:19.275 --> 00:20:20.975
He knew this was a man after his own heart.

408
00:20:21.155 --> 00:20:22.375
But it wasn't just for David,

409
00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:27.645
it was also God anointed David as the king.

410
00:20:27.705 --> 00:20:28.925
Not just because of his commitment.

411
00:20:29.025 --> 00:20:30.485
God anointed David as the king

412
00:20:30.485 --> 00:20:33.645
because of his purposes in David's life.

413
00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:36.335
For God's purposes,

414
00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:40.575
he anointed David in history in the world in David's life.

415
00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:44.175
In all that God anointed David, God brought all this

416
00:20:44.205 --> 00:20:46.175
because of his purposes.

417
00:20:47.285 --> 00:20:47.785
In the end

418
00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:54.885
I I said that David was anointed by God.

419
00:20:54.885 --> 00:20:57.205
That doesn't mean that God approved of everything David did.

420
00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:04.675
But what we see is that God clearly had a massive

421
00:21:04.895 --> 00:21:09.155
and eternal purpose for David, for David's life

422
00:21:09.855 --> 00:21:14.215
to lead God's people in a more godly way than Saul did,

423
00:21:16.415 --> 00:21:18.955
to bring about prosperity and protection

424
00:21:18.955 --> 00:21:21.075
and safety more than any other king did.

425
00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:27.495
And eventually one of the purposes of David's anointing

426
00:21:27.635 --> 00:21:31.935
as king was to be the line through which the king

427
00:21:31.935 --> 00:21:34.655
of kings would eventually come.

428
00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:38.095
That son of David referenced in the New Testament,

429
00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:41.135
the God man himself, Jesus Christ.

430
00:21:42.795 --> 00:21:45.935
See, that was one of the primary reasons that David became

431
00:21:47.025 --> 00:21:49.605
the king, was to begin the lineage

432
00:21:49.635 --> 00:21:52.485
through which Jesus would eventually come.

433
00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:59.995
What a purpose for a seemingly insignificant man

434
00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:01.155
from Bethlehem, right?

435
00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:05.685
God gave David his spirit.

436
00:22:09.335 --> 00:22:12.835
Now, I've mentioned this already a number of times today

437
00:22:12.835 --> 00:22:15.555
and throughout the series that that's first Samuel

438
00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:17.995
and especially the rest of it from this point forward is

439
00:22:17.995 --> 00:22:21.115
really an extended contrast between Saul and David.

440
00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:25.725
It just sets them up as opposites and how to respond to God.

441
00:22:26.465 --> 00:22:28.245
And it becomes abundantly clear,

442
00:22:28.275 --> 00:22:30.725
even right here at the start of their relationship.

443
00:22:33.215 --> 00:22:34.635
So verse 13, right?

444
00:22:35.975 --> 00:22:37.835
God gave his spirit, the spirit

445
00:22:37.835 --> 00:22:38.915
of the Lord rushed upon David.

446
00:22:38.945 --> 00:22:41.915
From that day forward, we see it abundantly clear.

447
00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:43.875
God gave his spirit to David.

448
00:22:44.215 --> 00:22:47.395
But immediately next in verse 14,

449
00:22:49.355 --> 00:22:51.735
the very next verse, what happened?

450
00:22:53.855 --> 00:22:55.955
God removed his spirit from Saul.

451
00:22:59.275 --> 00:23:01.815
God removed his spirit from Saul.

452
00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:03.135
He had given his spirit to David.

453
00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:06.335
And the next verse, God removed his spirit

454
00:23:06.925 --> 00:23:09.135
from Saul like these two verses,

455
00:23:09.195 --> 00:23:10.975
you can't get any more different.

456
00:23:12.385 --> 00:23:15.655
You can't get any more final about

457
00:23:15.655 --> 00:23:17.175
how God had given his spirit to David

458
00:23:17.475 --> 00:23:20.015
and taken his spirit away from Saul.

459
00:23:20.605 --> 00:23:24.295
It's final now that this is what God was doing.

460
00:23:24.365 --> 00:23:26.295
He'd rejected Saul from being the king

461
00:23:26.435 --> 00:23:28.775
and he'd anointed David as the new King

462
00:23:31.925 --> 00:23:35.545
and the rest of the chapter nearly overemphasizes

463
00:23:35.545 --> 00:23:39.285
what God was doing in replacing Saul, right?

464
00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:42.365
You see this, this interaction between this evil spirit

465
00:23:42.385 --> 00:23:44.485
and the good spirit and David and Saul

466
00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:46.805
and David's, this well-known man

467
00:23:46.805 --> 00:23:49.205
and Saul is already over here in a really bad place

468
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:52.605
and how they interact together, it's nearly showing us

469
00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:55.525
to an over extent what God is doing

470
00:23:55.525 --> 00:23:57.165
to replace Saul with David.

471
00:23:59.845 --> 00:24:01.715
Again, Saul's gonna remain in the position of King

472
00:24:01.715 --> 00:24:03.435
until his death at the end of the book.

473
00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:07.645
But already this move has happened towards David.

474
00:24:09.835 --> 00:24:13.175
Now we've shown this chart throughout the series already

475
00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:17.095
and you can see it where we're beginning to see the decline

476
00:24:17.195 --> 00:24:18.695
of Saul's popularity

477
00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:21.815
and David now ascending in popularity,

478
00:24:23.485 --> 00:24:26.555
which will only cross over further and further.

479
00:24:26.655 --> 00:24:29.635
And that tension between the two of them only grows

480
00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.395
as we move forward in the book.

481
00:24:34.255 --> 00:24:38.075
And what we'll come to find out is that Saul is very jealous

482
00:24:38.585 --> 00:24:41.275
that God is now with David and not with him.

483
00:24:42.855 --> 00:24:45.755
And we'll see where that ends up throughout the book.

484
00:24:48.885 --> 00:24:53.265
So that's what was happening back then in chapter 16.

485
00:24:53.285 --> 00:24:55.945
That's what historically happened.

486
00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:58.265
Whether it was first or second between David

487
00:24:58.265 --> 00:24:59.945
and Goliath, we don't know officially, but,

488
00:24:59.945 --> 00:25:02.505
but that's what happened here to highlight David having

489
00:25:02.865 --> 00:25:06.305
received God's spirit and anointing as king.

490
00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:12.315
But what does that all mean for us today currently?

491
00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:15.605
Like how, how does that come forward to today?

492
00:25:15.765 --> 00:25:16.685
'cause we're not dealing with Kings,

493
00:25:16.685 --> 00:25:17.605
we're not dealing with Saul and David.

494
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:20.365
Okay? What do we take from this?

495
00:25:20.365 --> 00:25:21.885
Here are a couple principles

496
00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:25.445
that we can glean from this today.

497
00:25:28.045 --> 00:25:32.305
Here's the first one. We need to remember

498
00:25:33.135 --> 00:25:35.665
that God sees things differently.

499
00:25:39.525 --> 00:25:42.055
This should be just a great foundational truth for us

500
00:25:42.115 --> 00:25:43.175
to remember in our lives.

501
00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:45.375
God sees things differently than we do.

502
00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:53.295
Remember the The People's Choice Awards back then Saul won

503
00:25:53.455 --> 00:25:54.775
that one, right?

504
00:25:54.775 --> 00:25:56.175
The people's choice was Saul.

505
00:25:57.045 --> 00:25:58.375
They picked him because he's tall.

506
00:25:59.795 --> 00:26:01.155
I can't keep rhyming that. I don't know.

507
00:26:01.155 --> 00:26:02.275
I was about to go somewhere with that,

508
00:26:02.335 --> 00:26:04.075
but I couldn't think quick enough.

509
00:26:04.215 --> 00:26:08.535
But based on his stature, that's what they picked him like.

510
00:26:08.535 --> 00:26:11.495
And we saw how that ended up. It didn't go well.

511
00:26:11.595 --> 00:26:14.455
The people's choice was Saul, but God's choice.

512
00:26:16.255 --> 00:26:19.965
David was based on something totally different,

513
00:26:21.375 --> 00:26:23.205
completely different stipulation,

514
00:26:23.205 --> 00:26:25.565
completely different process and context.

515
00:26:27.495 --> 00:26:29.275
But what that reveals, this is so interesting,

516
00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:33.195
this reveals this theme that is all over God's word.

517
00:26:35.185 --> 00:26:38.015
Where God chooses the one who might

518
00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:39.535
otherwise have been passed over.

519
00:26:41.765 --> 00:26:43.605
Just think about the stories, you know, right?

520
00:26:43.605 --> 00:26:46.875
Jacob and Esau, the older son

521
00:26:47.445 --> 00:26:52.245
would one day serve the younger son you, you think about

522
00:26:53.775 --> 00:26:57.855
Joseph amongst his brothers, one

523
00:26:57.855 --> 00:27:00.215
of the young ones like how did, why did he get picked?

524
00:27:00.555 --> 00:27:03.485
You think of Baron Sarah,

525
00:27:05.445 --> 00:27:09.735
90 years old, God blesses her with the ability

526
00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:10.815
to have the chosen son.

527
00:27:10.815 --> 00:27:15.785
Isaac, even in the book

528
00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:18.575
we're studying, you remember back to the beginning,

529
00:27:18.575 --> 00:27:21.435
Hannah, Hannah's barren.

530
00:27:21.435 --> 00:27:22.595
Hannah's unable to have children.

531
00:27:22.755 --> 00:27:25.715
Hannah's been praying, asking God, wanting, longing.

532
00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:30.915
And God blesses her with a son named Samuel

533
00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:35.085
who turns into Samuel here, right?

534
00:27:36.735 --> 00:27:40.655
And then now David, the runt of the litter,

535
00:27:42.935 --> 00:27:45.795
no other circumstance says this guy should be the king.

536
00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:50.155
God picks him over the seven other sons who look the part.

537
00:27:54.225 --> 00:27:56.485
And so with families, God works this out.

538
00:27:56.505 --> 00:27:58.845
God often does things that don't fit.

539
00:27:58.945 --> 00:28:02.965
He sees things differently. But it's not just with families.

540
00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:06.885
We see it in God choosing Israel itself.

541
00:28:08.955 --> 00:28:11.215
Listen to this. This is Deuteronomy chapter seven,

542
00:28:11.795 --> 00:28:13.015
verses six through eight.

543
00:28:13.045 --> 00:28:16.295
This is as the people are exiting Egypt,

544
00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:21.655
listen to God say this for you are a people holy

545
00:28:21.795 --> 00:28:22.935
to the Lord your God.

546
00:28:23.235 --> 00:28:25.815
The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people

547
00:28:26.275 --> 00:28:29.455
for his treasured possession out of all the peoples

548
00:28:29.595 --> 00:28:30.655
who were on the face of the earth.

549
00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:34.765
But it was not because you were more in

550
00:28:34.765 --> 00:28:36.045
number than any other people.

551
00:28:36.045 --> 00:28:37.605
That the Lord set his love on you

552
00:28:37.605 --> 00:28:39.645
and chose you for you are actually the

553
00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:41.605
fewest of all peoples.

554
00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:45.765
But it is He chose because the Lord loves you

555
00:28:46.855 --> 00:28:49.195
and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers,

556
00:28:49.195 --> 00:28:51.195
that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand

557
00:28:51.195 --> 00:28:53.955
and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the house

558
00:28:54.015 --> 00:28:55.955
of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

559
00:28:59.115 --> 00:29:03.745
You see that God chose them for their weakness.

560
00:29:06.275 --> 00:29:10.265
Why? Same reason He chooses

561
00:29:10.265 --> 00:29:11.385
people like you and me today.

562
00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:15.315
This is what Paul, the Apostle Paul wrote

563
00:29:15.315 --> 00:29:16.635
to the church in Corinth.

564
00:29:16.635 --> 00:29:18.835
First Corinthians chapter one verse 26,

565
00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:21.435
for Consider your calling Brothers, not many

566
00:29:21.435 --> 00:29:23.875
of you were wise according to worldly standards.

567
00:29:24.335 --> 00:29:26.955
Not many were powerful. Not many were of noble birth.

568
00:29:27.175 --> 00:29:29.475
But God chose what is foolish in the world

569
00:29:29.575 --> 00:29:30.595
to shame the wise.

570
00:29:31.135 --> 00:29:33.995
God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong

571
00:29:34.535 --> 00:29:36.955
God chose what is low despised in the world.

572
00:29:36.955 --> 00:29:39.115
Even things that are not to bring to nothing.

573
00:29:39.115 --> 00:29:42.405
Things that are so that, so that

574
00:29:43.505 --> 00:29:46.205
no human being might boast in the presence of God.

575
00:29:48.065 --> 00:29:49.765
And because of him, you are in Christ

576
00:29:49.765 --> 00:29:51.045
Jesus who became to us.

577
00:29:51.045 --> 00:29:54.365
Wisdom from God. Righteousness, sanctification, redemption.

578
00:29:54.785 --> 00:29:56.965
So that as it is written, let the one

579
00:29:56.965 --> 00:29:59.925
who boasts boast in the Lord.

580
00:30:01.155 --> 00:30:04.895
You see that God chooses the weak

581
00:30:05.355 --> 00:30:08.015
so he can show off his power through them.

582
00:30:10.265 --> 00:30:12.005
God sees things differently than we do.

583
00:30:14.985 --> 00:30:16.785
'cause remember, David's an unlikely candidate.

584
00:30:18.475 --> 00:30:20.615
He was cute, but he was forgotten.

585
00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:24.525
He was out in the field, a lowly shepherd,

586
00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:26.845
and he was in an undistinguished family,

587
00:30:27.145 --> 00:30:29.285
in a forgotten town, unimportant town.

588
00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:33.885
And as humans, we are so prone to look for the obvious

589
00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:37.165
to say, well, that guy looks the part, he must be the one.

590
00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:39.245
This guy over here, he's worth nothing.

591
00:30:39.495 --> 00:30:43.005
Let's forget about him. That's what we are prone to do.

592
00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:45.805
But God's ways are not our ways.

593
00:30:49.215 --> 00:30:50.745
Look past the cover of the book, right?

594
00:30:50.745 --> 00:30:52.145
Because that's the way God looks.

595
00:30:52.245 --> 00:30:56.905
God does not look at the outside, he looks at the inside.

596
00:30:56.925 --> 00:30:58.305
So lemme give you two applications,

597
00:31:00.265 --> 00:31:02.645
two base level applications.

598
00:31:03.055 --> 00:31:05.915
First, listen, never,

599
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:09.665
never feel unimportant in the eyes of the Lord.

600
00:31:12.005 --> 00:31:14.185
You should never, no matter who you are,

601
00:31:14.565 --> 00:31:17.905
you should never feel unimportant in the eyes of the Lord.

602
00:31:21.615 --> 00:31:22.655
I know your mind is thinking,

603
00:31:22.655 --> 00:31:25.655
but I'm not prominent, I'm not talented, I'm not wealthy.

604
00:31:26.095 --> 00:31:27.895
I don't have a prominent position.

605
00:31:28.655 --> 00:31:30.215
Whatever it is you're thinking,

606
00:31:30.215 --> 00:31:32.815
the enemy's tossing in your brain trying to get you to say,

607
00:31:32.815 --> 00:31:34.215
well no, you're really not that important.

608
00:31:34.365 --> 00:31:36.255
Look, you don't stand up on the stage and do anything.

609
00:31:36.255 --> 00:31:37.775
You're not. You're not that important.

610
00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:40.215
Listen, one Corinthians one, what did it say?

611
00:31:40.435 --> 00:31:41.655
He gets more glory.

612
00:31:42.005 --> 00:31:44.695
When someone is not wise, according

613
00:31:44.695 --> 00:31:46.895
to the world standards, he gets more glory.

614
00:31:47.085 --> 00:31:50.135
When someone does not have worldly power out there

615
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:53.535
that they can leverage, he gets more glory for that.

616
00:31:55.915 --> 00:31:58.255
Now listen, God might have made you talented.

617
00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:01.905
God might have made you strong.

618
00:32:02.165 --> 00:32:04.825
God might have given you a prominent position.

619
00:32:05.055 --> 00:32:07.105
It's not wrong to have those things.

620
00:32:07.365 --> 00:32:09.345
He says Not many of you are wise, like

621
00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:10.545
so somebody's gonna be wise.

622
00:32:11.885 --> 00:32:14.705
God gifts us in different ways. That's absolutely true.

623
00:32:15.085 --> 00:32:17.425
But if you are talented, wealthy,

624
00:32:18.765 --> 00:32:20.345
you have a prominent position, whatever it is,

625
00:32:20.345 --> 00:32:22.705
if you are any those things, be careful

626
00:32:25.885 --> 00:32:30.015
because it is really, really easy to trust in yourself,

627
00:32:33.075 --> 00:32:34.455
to boast in yourself.

628
00:32:37.705 --> 00:32:40.735
And lemme tell you that's that's my story

629
00:32:40.795 --> 00:32:41.935
for a good chunk of my life.

630
00:32:45.865 --> 00:32:50.275
Like I acted for so long as if the abilities that I had,

631
00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:53.335
I somehow deserved them.

632
00:32:56.155 --> 00:33:00.215
And and I, I acted as if like they weren't God's gift, but,

633
00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:02.615
but I just kind of created them somehow.

634
00:33:05.245 --> 00:33:06.385
And you know what that led to?

635
00:33:08.175 --> 00:33:12.565
It led to a lot of pride, a lot of self-sufficiency

636
00:33:12.665 --> 00:33:13.925
and self-reliance.

637
00:33:15.795 --> 00:33:18.855
It certainly did not lead to boasting in the Lord,

638
00:33:21.345 --> 00:33:22.385
boasting in myself.

639
00:33:27.015 --> 00:33:30.875
We must not forget that everything we have is from Him.

640
00:33:32.925 --> 00:33:36.395
Everything we have, every ability you have,

641
00:33:38.665 --> 00:33:43.485
any resources, you have any position or family

642
00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:47.725
or whatever you have, it is all from the Lord's hand.

643
00:33:50.325 --> 00:33:51.865
You did not choose any of that.

644
00:33:52.525 --> 00:33:55.105
God did this for no, but I made the money.

645
00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:56.425
No, God gave you the ability

646
00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:57.625
to think to make the money right?

647
00:33:57.645 --> 00:34:01.305
So you understand God gave you, this is all from his hand

648
00:34:01.405 --> 00:34:05.265
and he has a purpose to glorify His name through

649
00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:09.815
what you can do, also through

650
00:34:09.815 --> 00:34:14.095
what you can't do to glorify his name

651
00:34:14.205 --> 00:34:16.655
through doing something you can't do on your own.

652
00:34:16.835 --> 00:34:21.175
And it takes him to do it in you. That is a pointer.

653
00:34:21.395 --> 00:34:23.415
All of it is a pointer to him.

654
00:34:28.025 --> 00:34:32.085
So do not feel unimportant in the eyes of the Lord.

655
00:34:33.475 --> 00:34:36.135
He does not see things the way everybody else sees them.

656
00:34:40.045 --> 00:34:41.425
But here's what that means. We should do.

657
00:34:43.085 --> 00:34:46.185
We must prioritize what's on the inside.

658
00:34:47.325 --> 00:34:49.545
We must prioritize the heart.

659
00:34:50.085 --> 00:34:52.865
If God sees things differently than the way the world sees

660
00:34:52.865 --> 00:34:55.065
them, then we better prioritize what he sees

661
00:34:55.065 --> 00:34:58.705
as the most important, our relationship with him.

662
00:34:59.115 --> 00:35:02.475
Prioritize that above the outside.

663
00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:10.055
'cause just think about, think about how much money we spend

664
00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:13.335
on the containers of our lives,

665
00:35:16.965 --> 00:35:19.705
plastic surgery, new cars,

666
00:35:21.195 --> 00:35:22.925
Instagram worthy vacations,

667
00:35:26.045 --> 00:35:30.525
all to polish the container of our lives

668
00:35:31.585 --> 00:35:34.485
so that people think we're better than we actually are.

669
00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:44.765
Are we putting an even higher value than all

670
00:35:44.765 --> 00:35:48.165
of those things on what's inside our hearts?

671
00:35:48.865 --> 00:35:50.605
On our hearts, our relationship with him?

672
00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:53.525
Are we, are we prioritizing how we stand with him?

673
00:35:53.525 --> 00:35:55.365
Where we stand with him, how we're pursuing him?

674
00:35:55.465 --> 00:35:56.645
Are we doing anything like that?

675
00:35:56.825 --> 00:35:59.485
Or are we so focused on the container

676
00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:00.925
and what people think about us

677
00:36:01.145 --> 00:36:03.205
and what we look like to other people

678
00:36:03.475 --> 00:36:05.685
that we forget what's most important to God?

679
00:36:09.535 --> 00:36:10.835
That's what he cares about the most.

680
00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:12.875
He says it explicitly right here.

681
00:36:12.875 --> 00:36:14.635
That's what he cares about the most.

682
00:36:14.905 --> 00:36:18.115
Even more hear me even more than religious activities.

683
00:36:20.045 --> 00:36:24.425
That was Saul sacrificing, doing the right things,

684
00:36:24.425 --> 00:36:26.665
saying the right things, showing up at church like you have

685
00:36:26.665 --> 00:36:29.545
it all together, giving, serving all whatever it is

686
00:36:29.885 --> 00:36:31.785
to polish the container.

687
00:36:35.275 --> 00:36:36.975
But God's more focused on what's in here

688
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:39.325
and he sees right through it that

689
00:36:39.325 --> 00:36:41.615
that container might be empty.

690
00:36:43.175 --> 00:36:45.715
He wants your heart. He sees things differently.

691
00:36:45.935 --> 00:36:49.155
He wants your heart. So what do we do with that?

692
00:36:49.525 --> 00:36:51.355
Let's treat each other differently

693
00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:53.795
because that's what God prioritizes,

694
00:36:53.815 --> 00:36:54.835
not what's on the outside.

695
00:36:57.935 --> 00:36:59.115
We give a lot of prominence.

696
00:36:59.115 --> 00:37:02.355
We give a lot of deference to people who have a lot of this

697
00:37:02.375 --> 00:37:03.835
or a lot of that, or are able to do this.

698
00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:06.795
And like, that's not the way God works.

699
00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:08.795
Let's not look to the outside first.

700
00:37:08.885 --> 00:37:10.555
Let's look on what's on the inside first

701
00:37:15.145 --> 00:37:17.365
and then as a result of that in our own lives,

702
00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:18.965
let's live our lives differently.

703
00:37:18.995 --> 00:37:21.645
Because our hearts are our priority.

704
00:37:21.985 --> 00:37:25.085
The focus is on God's presence, his his relationship

705
00:37:25.085 --> 00:37:27.845
with us first and foremost, from the inside out.

706
00:37:27.975 --> 00:37:31.605
Let's live differently as a result of what he's done.

707
00:37:34.995 --> 00:37:38.415
So that's the first principle. God sees things differently.

708
00:37:38.475 --> 00:37:40.935
The second principle here though is similar,

709
00:37:40.935 --> 00:37:43.095
that we must not neglect it from chapter 16.

710
00:37:43.155 --> 00:37:47.415
The truth is that God will accomplish his purposes.

711
00:37:51.545 --> 00:37:54.975
God's gonna do his work. God will accomplish his purposes.

712
00:37:54.975 --> 00:37:56.775
The theological word for that is sovereignty.

713
00:37:56.925 --> 00:38:01.455
He's in charge. We cannot stop or thwart his work.

714
00:38:01.555 --> 00:38:02.815
He will accomplish it.

715
00:38:02.835 --> 00:38:07.495
One Samuel shows us that, that God does his work through

716
00:38:08.255 --> 00:38:09.695
whatever, through people who obey him.

717
00:38:09.875 --> 00:38:12.735
But God also works through people who disobey him.

718
00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:19.675
God works through godly and ungodly people making good

719
00:38:19.775 --> 00:38:20.875
and bad decisions.

720
00:38:20.935 --> 00:38:22.355
He does it. He works it out.

721
00:38:22.385 --> 00:38:24.915
He's going to accomplish his purposes.

722
00:38:24.915 --> 00:38:26.075
But even further than that,

723
00:38:26.295 --> 00:38:30.115
how he's gonna do it is he will put people in situations

724
00:38:30.425 --> 00:38:32.915
that he never, that we never could have expected

725
00:38:34.765 --> 00:38:37.565
God will accomplish by putting people in positions

726
00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:40.325
to bring about what he desires in the world.

727
00:38:40.325 --> 00:38:44.195
Just think about David. Do you think David is sitting out in

728
00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:47.355
the field strumming his harp with the sheep

729
00:38:47.415 --> 00:38:48.835
and he's sitting there dreaming like, you know,

730
00:38:48.915 --> 00:38:50.275
I can't wait till someday that I'm

731
00:38:50.275 --> 00:38:51.515
serving in the king's court.

732
00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:55.115
I'm gonna kill a giant. I'm going to be the king one day.

733
00:38:57.965 --> 00:38:59.625
He has no clue that that's coming.

734
00:38:59.925 --> 00:39:03.075
His heart was just saying, God, I'm yours. I'll do whatever.

735
00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:07.145
I'm for you. I'm with you. Here we go. I'm gonna serve.

736
00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:09.065
I'm gonna do a thing. I'm gonna be what I need

737
00:39:09.065 --> 00:39:10.425
to be on the inside.

738
00:39:10.425 --> 00:39:13.505
That's it. And then God put him in a position to accomplish

739
00:39:14.035 --> 00:39:15.425
God's purposes.

740
00:39:16.985 --> 00:39:19.565
That's what made the difference. God's presence.

741
00:39:19.565 --> 00:39:21.765
That's what's clear. God's presence is

742
00:39:21.765 --> 00:39:23.285
what made the difference.

743
00:39:23.685 --> 00:39:26.085
Whatever God had Desi assigned David to do,

744
00:39:26.305 --> 00:39:29.365
it would only work by God's power through God's presence.

745
00:39:30.275 --> 00:39:31.785
David couldn't do this on his own.

746
00:39:31.885 --> 00:39:34.945
He couldn't have tried to manipulate his way to the throne.

747
00:39:35.245 --> 00:39:36.305
It was only God.

748
00:39:37.725 --> 00:39:40.035
We'll see next week that show up really clearly.

749
00:39:40.265 --> 00:39:44.195
Next chapter. But listen, it's not just for David.

750
00:39:46.005 --> 00:39:50.215
It's the same for you and me. It's the same for our church.

751
00:39:53.145 --> 00:39:55.645
God will accomplish his mission, his purpose in the world.

752
00:39:55.825 --> 00:39:56.925
We don't have to worry about that.

753
00:39:56.925 --> 00:39:58.565
We don't have to worry about tomorrow what's

754
00:39:58.695 --> 00:39:59.925
going on in the news.

755
00:39:59.985 --> 00:40:01.485
We don't have to worry about death even.

756
00:40:01.625 --> 00:40:03.245
We know God's gonna accomplish all

757
00:40:03.245 --> 00:40:04.485
he's promised to do in His word.

758
00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:06.445
He's good on it. We don't have to worry about it.

759
00:40:08.845 --> 00:40:11.305
But if we want to participate in it,

760
00:40:14.125 --> 00:40:16.345
Not just let it happen and God has to work around us,

761
00:40:16.445 --> 00:40:19.305
God does things on his own like we don't, he'll do it.

762
00:40:19.845 --> 00:40:23.705
But if we wanna participate in the blessing of being a part

763
00:40:23.845 --> 00:40:27.985
of his mission and purpose in the world, we have to be

764
00:40:28.535 --> 00:40:30.665
desperately dependent upon it.

765
00:40:34.755 --> 00:40:38.775
We must have hearts solely focused on the Lord, looking

766
00:40:38.795 --> 00:40:42.815
to His spirit inside us as our leader, as our power.

767
00:40:44.015 --> 00:40:45.055
'cause here's what God says, one

768
00:40:45.055 --> 00:40:46.895
of my favorite verses, Zechariah four, six.

769
00:40:47.435 --> 00:40:50.375
It says, not by might nor by power,

770
00:40:50.755 --> 00:40:53.455
but by my spirit says the Lord of hosts.

771
00:40:56.755 --> 00:41:01.135
Let we modernize that, not by talent, not

772
00:41:01.195 --> 00:41:04.775
by ability, not by wealth, not by resources, not

773
00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:08.295
by prominence, not by reputation, not by influence,

774
00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:12.175
but by my spirit says the Lord of hosts.

775
00:41:13.565 --> 00:41:18.345
That's how he works. And so are you willing,

776
00:41:18.345 --> 00:41:22.335
church are, are you willing

777
00:41:23.195 --> 00:41:24.735
to give him your all

778
00:41:26.715 --> 00:41:31.245
and watch him do what he does with your life? When you

779
00:41:31.245 --> 00:41:34.245
Do that, I say, God, I'm yours.

780
00:41:34.345 --> 00:41:38.045
I'm open. I'm willing. And he will do something with it

781
00:41:38.305 --> 00:41:41.405
by his presence in you, meaning his power in you

782
00:41:41.585 --> 00:41:44.125
to do something you could never have imagined on your own.

783
00:41:44.505 --> 00:41:45.005
Yes, you.

784
00:41:49.685 --> 00:41:53.345
What's our responsibility is to position

785
00:41:54.085 --> 00:41:57.825
our hearts, our lives to be usable.

786
00:41:58.155 --> 00:42:02.615
Containers. He doesn't care if it's clay

787
00:42:02.615 --> 00:42:03.975
or if it's silver, or if it's gold.

788
00:42:03.975 --> 00:42:06.935
He doesn't care. Is it usable?

789
00:42:07.995 --> 00:42:12.775
That's what he cares about. God, make me a usable vessel.

790
00:42:12.795 --> 00:42:14.175
That's a great prayer to pray.
