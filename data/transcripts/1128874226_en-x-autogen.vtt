WEBVTT

1
00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:19.965
Good morning church.

2
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:21.765
Uh, my name is Brandon

3
00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.365
and I get to serve here in the student ministry.

4
00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:27.445
Uh, if you are new here, uh, I might be the first

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:28.445

6
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:30.165
We're so glad you're here.

00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.205

Uh, if you're not new here

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:42.925

and you're ready to take a next step, we have a class called

14
00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:48.325

kicks off next Sunday at 9:00 AM in Room 1 0 4.

16
00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:56.605
It's a five week class designed to help you just learn

17
00:00:56.605 --> 00:00:58.245
who we are as a church, what we believe,

18
00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:01.085
how you can be involved, and just all the things.

19
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.405
There's no sign up required. So just show up and join us.

20
00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:07.165
It'll be a great time. Um,

21
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.765
but if you're new here, if you're not new here, I want

22
00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:13.005
to remind you that we have been studying Second Samuel, uh,

23
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.405
the series of the Promise King.

24
00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:17.765
So let's turn our attention there.

25
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.685
We'll be in Second Samuel chapter 15

26
00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.125
and 16 this morning, second Samuel 15

27
00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.005
and 16.

28
00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:40.845
These past few weeks we have seen the promise King David

29
00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:43.605
himself fall in really big ways

30
00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:45.605
and we've seen the ripple effects

31
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.285
that it has had on him and his family.

32
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:48.485
So we're gonna show the graphic here

33
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:49.725
to kinda show where we're at.

34
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:52.085
We're in, we're in between the 13 and 19.

35
00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:54.965
And so David's personal troubles, uh,

36
00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:58.125
things are getting hard, uh, for him.

37
00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:04.525
But today in the midst of all the ripple effects,

38
00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:06.285
in the midst of all the suffering, in the midst

39
00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:10.005
of all the trials, we see David

40
00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:14.085
discover his dependence on the Lord

41
00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:17.405
in very real ways.

42
00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.005
We see David return to a place that he's very familiar

43
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:23.925
with the wilderness.

44
00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:27.725
Now it isn't by choice that David goes to the wilderness.

45
00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:30.525
He's not on a vacation per se,

46
00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:34.125
but it is a decision that is made for him

47
00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:38.005
because an enemy is on the rise

48
00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:40.245
and an enemy is coming after him.

49
00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:43.205
And this isn't a foreign nation,

50
00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:47.685
these aren't the Philistines, it's his own son who is coming

51
00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:51.565
after him and is coming for the throne.

52
00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:57.725
And I also wanna preface that this is a heavy text.

53
00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:02.205
There are things that we will see that we will struggle

54
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:03.405
to wrap our heads around.

55
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.725
But also, not only is this a heavy text,

56
00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:13.525
but some of you are walking through heavy seasons.

57
00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:19.285
Some of you guys may feel like you are in the wilderness.

58
00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:24.245
Some of you may be suffering right now as we speak.

59
00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:28.125
So my encouragement for us as we look at this text

60
00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:31.845
and as we look at our own lives is to zoom out

61
00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:34.045
and see the bigger picture.

62
00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.805
This is not just a story

63
00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:41.165
of a son revolting against his father for the throne.

64
00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:45.645
This story fits inside of a much bigger story that fits

65
00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.925
inside of a much bigger story.

66
00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:54.565
And so the bigger story that we see here is

67
00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:56.605
that God restores.

68
00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:01.485
And we see that in our text in uh, 15 through 16.

69
00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:03.485
'cause 15 and 16 is something really cool.

70
00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:05.525
They have this really cool bookend

71
00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:10.365
of God fulfilling his promise of judgment on David.

72
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:14.285
But in the middle of that, we see our main idea.

73
00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:16.405
We see the hope that we have.

74
00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:21.245
We see God in his grace, restoring, we see God in His grace

75
00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.485
bringing David back.

76
00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:27.565
But let's pray. Let's pray and ask the Lord to show us

77
00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:29.285
and to help us as we go.

78
00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:33.525
Lord, would you or would you open our eyes?

79
00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:34.685
Would you open our hearts

80
00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:38.525
and ears to see who you are through your word?

81
00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:42.485
God, would you make us more holy?

82
00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.245
Would you make us look more like Christ each and every day?

83
00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:49.645
God, would you use everything to restore us,

84
00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:51.485
to make us depend on you?

85
00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:53.325
In your name we pray. Amen.

86
00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:56.925
So I mentioned how chapter 15 and 16 have this book in.

87
00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:58.725
Well, what I mean by that, well, the theme

88
00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:01.325
that we say at the beginning of 15 is the same theme

89
00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:03.725
that we see at the end of 16.

90
00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:05.725
So what is the theme?

91
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:10.605
We see God's judgment on David

92
00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:12.845
through Absalon.

93
00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:18.925
We see God's judgments on David through Absalon.

94
00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:22.285
Let's first provide some context on why David is even

95
00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:23.445
being judged.

96
00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:28.565
Oh, we saw a couple weeks ago when second Samuel 11 though,

97
00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:30.445
while all of David's men were out at battle,

98
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.565
David remained in Jerusalem.

99
00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:37.285
It is there where he saw a woman named Bathsheba

100
00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:40.645
who had a husband named Uriah and the Lord

101
00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:42.885
and David Hughes the position that the Lord had given him

102
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.085
to take Bathsheba.

103
00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:48.205
And he doesn't stop there

104
00:05:48.205 --> 00:05:50.365
because when things become very real for David,

105
00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:52.365
he doesn't repent right away.

106
00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:56.525
But he again uses the position God has put him in

107
00:05:56.865 --> 00:06:00.805
to take out Uriah to cover up his sin.

108
00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:03.325
And God's word tells us

109
00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:06.085
that these actions displeased the Lord.

110
00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:10.685
But the Lord wasn't just displeased and moved on.

111
00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:16.805
No, the Lord raised up someone named Nathan to go to David

112
00:06:17.025 --> 00:06:19.845
to confront him and to tell him what was to come

113
00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:21.805
because of his sin.

114
00:06:21.825 --> 00:06:23.605
So because of David's sin with Bathsheba,

115
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:27.645
we see this in two Samuel 12, 11 through 14,

116
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:31.045
thus says the Lord

117
00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:36.245
behold I will raise the evil against you out

118
00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:39.725
of your own house and I will take your wives

119
00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:41.725
before your eyes and give them to your neighbor

120
00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:44.805
and he shall take your wives in the sight of the sun

121
00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:46.925
for you did it secretly.

122
00:06:47.385 --> 00:06:49.645
But I will do this thing. Before all Israel and

123
00:06:49.645 --> 00:06:53.365
before the sun, David said to Nathan,

124
00:06:53.645 --> 00:06:55.245
I have sinned against the Lord.

125
00:06:56.545 --> 00:06:57.565
And Nathan said to David,

126
00:06:58.225 --> 00:07:00.445
the Lord also has put away your sin.

127
00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:05.725
You shall not die nevertheless be God nevertheless.

128
00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.285
Because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord.

129
00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:12.685
The child who is born to you shall die.

130
00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:18.485
God's judgment on David is a result of David's sin.

131
00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.845
And in our text when we're reading it, we need that.

132
00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:24.045
We need that to be very clear.

133
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.005
Because as hard as the things we see in this text, we need

134
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:30.125
to understand that it is not without reason.

135
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:33.205
David's sin. David fell

136
00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:37.965
and this is the judgment to starting in chapter 15

137
00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:40.485
will read verses one through 12.

138
00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:46.645
So after this, Absalon got himself a chariot in horses

139
00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:49.725
and 50 men to run before him.

140
00:07:51.185 --> 00:07:52.685
And Absalon used to rise early

141
00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:55.165
and stand beside the way of the gates.

142
00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:57.805
And when any man had a dispute to come

143
00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.885
before the king for judgments, absalon would call to him

144
00:08:00.905 --> 00:08:03.245
and say, from what city are you?

145
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.325
And when he said, your servant is of such

146
00:08:06.325 --> 00:08:10.725
and such tribe in Israel, Epsilon would say to him, see,

147
00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.725
your claims are good and right,

148
00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:16.805
but there is no man designated by the king to hear you.

149
00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:21.645
Then Absalon would say, oh, that I were judged in the land

150
00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:25.525
and every man was a dispute or Cause might come to me

151
00:08:26.145 --> 00:08:27.325
and I would give him justice.

152
00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:31.725
Whenever a man came near to pay homage to him,

153
00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:35.205
he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.

154
00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:38.525
Thus Absalon did to all of Israel who had come

155
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:40.045
to the king for judgment.

156
00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:44.845
So Absalon stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

157
00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:49.165
At the end of the, at the end of four years, Absalon said

158
00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:53.885
to the king, please let me go pay my vow, which I have vowed

159
00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:57.565
to the Lord and he wrong for your servant, vow

160
00:08:57.565 --> 00:08:58.965
to vow while I lived de ashore

161
00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:02.325
and a Abraham saying, if the Lord will indeed bring me back

162
00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:05.605
to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the Lord.

163
00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:09.005
The king said to him, go in peace.

164
00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:11.285
So he rose and went to,

165
00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:16.085
but Absalon sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes

166
00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:18.885
of Israel saying, as soon as you hear the sign

167
00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:22.205
of the trumpet, then say, Absalon is king as Heon.

168
00:09:23.515 --> 00:09:25.285
When Absalon went, 200 men

169
00:09:25.435 --> 00:09:27.645
with absalon went 200 men from Jerusalem

170
00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:30.325
who were invited guests and they went in their innocence

171
00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:31.805
and knew nothing.

172
00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:35.565
And while Absalon was offering sacrifices, he sent

173
00:09:35.585 --> 00:09:37.645
for a HIA fell the Gileadite,

174
00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:40.645
David's counselor from his city Galo.

175
00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:42.765
And the conspiracy grew strong

176
00:09:42.825 --> 00:09:45.525
and the people with absalon kept increasing.

177
00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:49.605
So who is Absalon and why is he revolting against the king?

178
00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:52.045
Well, we learned last week that Absalon is one

179
00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:53.285
of David's sons.

180
00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:57.125
And more recently they haven't had the best relationship.

181
00:09:57.905 --> 00:10:00.845
It all started when Epsilon's sister, which happens

182
00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:04.245
to also be happens to also be one of David's daughters,

183
00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:08.405
was violated by another one of David's sons, which then led

184
00:10:08.405 --> 00:10:11.525
to Absalon taking matters into his own hands

185
00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:13.725
and to kill his half-brother.

186
00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:18.045
So because of this Absalon then flees the Gesu

187
00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:20.685
and lives there for three years away from his family,

188
00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:23.525
away from his home, away from David.

189
00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:27.565
Eventually Absalon is then brought back to Jerusalem,

190
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:30.405
but he's not allowed to be with the king

191
00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:33.125
and his presence for two whole years.

192
00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:37.575
And in that time we see bitterness grow inside

193
00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.055
of him against the king.

194
00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:42.295
And on top of that bitterness, there is already a sense

195
00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:44.255
of aggression in him.

196
00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:49.015
All that boiling up now leads to what we are seeing unfold.

197
00:10:50.795 --> 00:10:53.695
So we see David has sinned against a holy God

198
00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:55.975
and sin has consequences.

199
00:10:57.475 --> 00:10:59.415
And Nathan said that the consequence is

200
00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:01.335
that evil would rise out of his own house.

201
00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:05.655
We see that unfolding. Was David's sin forgiven?

202
00:11:06.275 --> 00:11:10.095
Yes. But did that sin still need to be dealt with?

203
00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:16.055
Yes. Absalon, David's son is simply serving as an agent

204
00:11:16.395 --> 00:11:19.815
or an instrument of God's judgments.

205
00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:22.655
He's making himself to be king.

206
00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:25.695
He's, he's getting these chariots, uh, and these horses

207
00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:27.895
and he's running, having them run in front of him.

208
00:11:29.885 --> 00:11:31.015
He's standing outside

209
00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:32.935
of the gate just stopping people on their way

210
00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:36.215
and he's using his smooth speech to convince them

211
00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:38.855
and persuade them to turn against David.

212
00:11:40.795 --> 00:11:42.135
And last week we saw

213
00:11:42.215 --> 00:11:44.895
that there was no one more handsome than Absalon.

214
00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:47.655
And so the people were easily won over.

215
00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:53.765
He was saying things, oh, if only I were in charge,

216
00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:57.845
if only I were the king,

217
00:11:58.675 --> 00:12:01.365
then just then you would get the judgment

218
00:12:01.435 --> 00:12:02.445
that you're looking for.

219
00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:06.685
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry that the king can't meet with you.

220
00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:10.645
He's busy with other matters or he isn't feeling well

221
00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:12.885
and says, well this is why I should be king.

222
00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:16.125
I I'm available, I'm here. I can give you what you want.

223
00:12:17.545 --> 00:12:19.525
But not only is he deceiving the people,

224
00:12:19.585 --> 00:12:23.085
he goes a step further to deceive David.

225
00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:28.965
He says, oh king, if you will, will you let your servant go

226
00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:30.885
and pay my vow to the Lord?

227
00:12:31.045 --> 00:12:34.165
I made a promise to him that if he ever brought me back

228
00:12:34.835 --> 00:12:36.645
that I would, I would pay offerings

229
00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:39.005
and worship to him there.

230
00:12:40.425 --> 00:12:43.405
But he's lying because we know that when Absalon got back

231
00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:46.245
to Jerusalem, he burns down Joe Abs field

232
00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:48.605
because he wouldn't talk to him.

233
00:12:49.755 --> 00:12:53.125
This is all a plot to overthrow David.

234
00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:54.885
We see this in verse 10 again.

235
00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:57.765
But Absalon sent secret messengers throughout

236
00:12:57.765 --> 00:12:58.885
all the tribes of Israel.

237
00:13:00.025 --> 00:13:01.925
As soon as you hear the child of the trumpet, then say,

238
00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:03.605
Absalon is king.

239
00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:06.725
And the people who were won over

240
00:13:06.845 --> 00:13:09.205
by abson kept growing and growing.

241
00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:12.925
And this becomes a problem for King David.

242
00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:18.525
But the hard part is, is that the problems don't stop there.

243
00:13:18.805 --> 00:13:20.805
Remember how I said it bookend. So in the beginning we see

244
00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:22.285
God's judgment on David through Abson,

245
00:13:22.285 --> 00:13:24.645
but we also see it at the ends.

246
00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:28.485
Turn with me to chapter 16 verse 15.

247
00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:32.365
As we see God's judgment unfold

248
00:13:34.325 --> 00:13:36.405
starting in verse 15.

249
00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:42.805
Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel came

250
00:13:42.805 --> 00:13:46.125
to Jerusalem and a HiTA fell with them, with him

251
00:13:47.145 --> 00:13:48.405
and hue the arch archive.

252
00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:52.485
David's friend came to Absalon Hue, said to Absalon,

253
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:55.965
long live the king, long live the king.

254
00:13:56.905 --> 00:13:58.805
And Absalon said to hue, is this your,

255
00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.165
is this your loyalty to your friends?

256
00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:04.365
Why did you not go with your friends who she said

257
00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:08.165
to Absalon, no for whom the Lord and his people

258
00:14:08.705 --> 00:14:11.605
and all the men of Israel have chosen his I will be

259
00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:16.245
and with him I will remain and again, whom should I serve?

260
00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:19.805
Should it not be his son as I serves your father,

261
00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.125
so I will serve you.

262
00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:23.925
Then Absalon said to Hitha fell,

263
00:14:24.475 --> 00:14:27.005
give your counsel, what shall we do?

264
00:14:28.255 --> 00:14:31.565
Hitha fell, said to Absalon, take your father's concubine

265
00:14:31.565 --> 00:14:33.765
to whom he has left to keep the house.

266
00:14:34.745 --> 00:14:37.325
And all Israel we hear that you have made yourself a stench

267
00:14:37.325 --> 00:14:40.685
to your father in the hands of all who are

268
00:14:40.685 --> 00:14:41.685
with you will be strengthened.

269
00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.525
So they pitched the 10 for Absalon on the roof

270
00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:47.525
and Absalon took his father's concubines in the sight

271
00:14:47.525 --> 00:14:48.605
of all Israel.

272
00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:51.680
Now in those days, the Council of Hitha fell,

273
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.685
gave was if one consulted the word of God.

274
00:14:54.585 --> 00:14:57.565
So was all the council of Hitha fell, esteemed both by David

275
00:14:57.785 --> 00:14:59.325
and by Absalon.

276
00:15:00.475 --> 00:15:02.285
Very disturbing scene we see here.

277
00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:05.805
But like I said at the very beginning, we must zoom out

278
00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:09.165
to see what the Lord is doing through it.

279
00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:13.365
God's judgment on David through Absalom.

280
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.885
And we can find comfort in the fact

281
00:15:16.395 --> 00:15:18.565
that God is not in the business

282
00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:20.365
of sweeping sins under the rug.

283
00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:24.965
God is not in the business of playing favorites.

284
00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:29.405
God sees all sin, even the sin of King David

285
00:15:29.435 --> 00:15:31.085
that he did in private.

286
00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:34.645
But not only does God see all sin,

287
00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:39.205
but God as a thorough judge, there must be a judgment

288
00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:43.405
for all sin, even our sin today.

289
00:15:45.665 --> 00:15:47.285
But if we just look at the judgment,

290
00:15:47.285 --> 00:15:48.885
then we would miss what's happening in the middle.

291
00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:53.445
We would miss what the Lord is doing through this 'cause.

292
00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:57.525
We see that through judgments, David is

293
00:15:58.445 --> 00:16:02.325
restored through judgments.

294
00:16:03.215 --> 00:16:07.685
David is restored. This is the main idea.

295
00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:10.445
This is what we find in the middle of what God is doing.

296
00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:12.325
Restoration,

297
00:16:14.275 --> 00:16:17.725
rediscovery, realignment.

298
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.285
And so we're gonna jump around

299
00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:22.125
and see how all that unfolds for David.

300
00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:24.845
But before, since there's a lot

301
00:16:24.845 --> 00:16:26.285
of scripture, I do want to set the scene.

302
00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:29.805
So we saw in 15 at the beginning, the Absalon has come up

303
00:16:29.805 --> 00:16:32.245
with this plan to overthrow the king.

304
00:16:33.455 --> 00:16:35.045
David eventually hears about this

305
00:16:35.065 --> 00:16:39.965
and he flees les's, they overtake them and David

306
00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:42.605
and his men go towards the wilderness.

307
00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:46.165
And if you're familiar with David back in one Samuel,

308
00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:50.365
we know that the wilderness is his bread and butter.

309
00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:54.245
The wilderness is his home court advantage.

310
00:16:54.435 --> 00:16:57.445
It's his paycom center with the best fans in the world

311
00:16:58.195 --> 00:17:00.605
because in one Samuel we saw

312
00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:05.445
in the wilderness the Lord Hughes that time it's

313
00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:07.765
where David has grown the most.

314
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.685
It's where he writes these psalms.

315
00:17:11.635 --> 00:17:14.525
It's where he depends on the Lord in very real ways.

316
00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:17.485
It's where he becomes the king the Lord wants him to be.

317
00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:22.165
But just because it's the place that he's familiar

318
00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:25.285
with doesn't make it any less difficult.

319
00:17:25.865 --> 00:17:27.765
It is still a hard season for David.

320
00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:29.725
So we're gonna see a lot of pain

321
00:17:29.785 --> 00:17:31.685
and a lot of heartache unfold for him.

322
00:17:32.515 --> 00:17:34.085
Like I said, we're gonna pull out these moments

323
00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:36.565
where we see the Lord really working in his heart

324
00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:38.925
and drawing him closer to him.

325
00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:43.925
So where do we say, let's start in chapter 15, verse 19

326
00:17:44.545 --> 00:17:48.845
and 20, chapter 15, 19 and 20.

327
00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:51.085
This says as they're leaving Jerusalem,

328
00:17:52.275 --> 00:17:54.645
then the king said the itai, the gi.

329
00:17:55.905 --> 00:17:59.645
Why do you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king.

330
00:18:00.505 --> 00:18:03.565
For you are a foreigner and also in exile from your home.

331
00:18:04.745 --> 00:18:07.405
You came only yesterday in July.

332
00:18:07.415 --> 00:18:09.285
Today make you wander about with us

333
00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:11.765
since I go, I know not where.

334
00:18:12.665 --> 00:18:14.325
Go back and take your brothers with you

335
00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:17.285
and may the Lord show steadfast love

336
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:18.805
and faithfulness to you.

337
00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:23.125
So David is fleeing because an army is invading his home

338
00:18:24.385 --> 00:18:27.525
and potentially the army will come after him here soon.

339
00:18:28.465 --> 00:18:30.765
And so it makes the most sense to keep them around

340
00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.605
for protection.

341
00:18:34.465 --> 00:18:39.445
But instead David is looking out for the welfare of others.

342
00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:42.845
Not only that, but he is also pointing these

343
00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:45.045
foreigners to Yahweh.

344
00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:49.165
In the middle of everything going on, he's looking to

345
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:53.805
and calling on Yahweh's steadfast love and faithfulness.

346
00:18:55.215 --> 00:18:57.165
There is fear running through him.

347
00:18:58.425 --> 00:19:02.685
His family is broken, he's out of control,

348
00:19:03.105 --> 00:19:04.285
he is confused,

349
00:19:05.785 --> 00:19:08.565
but yet he is hoping in the love

350
00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:12.125
and faithfulness of the Lord, the love

351
00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:14.685
that he has been shown time and time again.

352
00:19:14.685 --> 00:19:18.685
Here we see David is demonstrating selflessness and hope.

353
00:19:19.435 --> 00:19:22.845
Jump down with me to verses 24 to 26.

354
00:19:25.825 --> 00:19:27.045
And AAR came up

355
00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:30.765
and behold Zadak came also with all the Levites

356
00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:33.205
bearing the arc of the covenant of God

357
00:19:34.145 --> 00:19:35.645
and they sat down the ark of God

358
00:19:36.015 --> 00:19:38.285
until the people had all passed out of this city

359
00:19:39.425 --> 00:19:42.245
and the king said, Zadak carry the ark

360
00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:43.485
of God back into the city.

361
00:19:44.425 --> 00:19:46.325
If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord,

362
00:19:46.905 --> 00:19:49.445
he will bring me back and let me see both it

363
00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:50.845
and his dwelling place.

364
00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:55.925
But if he says, I have no pleasure in you, behold here I am.

365
00:19:56.785 --> 00:19:59.645
Let him do to me what seems good to him

366
00:20:01.345 --> 00:20:04.765
as David is leaving Jerusalem, the priests wanna make sure

367
00:20:04.765 --> 00:20:06.925
that he's protected, make sure the arc stays with him

368
00:20:07.785 --> 00:20:09.005
and wouldn't it make sense for David

369
00:20:09.025 --> 00:20:10.245
to want the arc there with him?

370
00:20:11.185 --> 00:20:13.325
But here's where we see more connections to one Samuel,

371
00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:15.365
back in one Samuel four,

372
00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:16.645
before we ever met David

373
00:20:16.655 --> 00:20:18.845
where the main characters were Samuel Eli

374
00:20:19.145 --> 00:20:23.005
and his sons, Israel was in a battle with the Philistines

375
00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:25.085
and they were losing this battle.

376
00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:28.045
So all the leaders of Israel had this idea,

377
00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:31.805
let's go grab the ark and maybe then we'll win the battle.

378
00:20:31.855 --> 00:20:34.285
Let's, let's use the Lord as something to Hughes

379
00:20:35.425 --> 00:20:38.165
for our protection, this genie in the bottle

380
00:20:38.165 --> 00:20:39.165
that we can whip out

381
00:20:39.765 --> 00:20:43.965
whenever the problem is, like I said, they were viewing God

382
00:20:44.025 --> 00:20:46.965
as something to just be something to Hughes.

383
00:20:48.145 --> 00:20:49.565
And so they end up losing the battle

384
00:20:49.945 --> 00:20:52.565
and the arc is captured by the Philistines.

385
00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:55.965
And so there's a similar situation here with David

386
00:20:56.775 --> 00:20:59.125
where there is an enemy attacking him

387
00:20:59.855 --> 00:21:01.685
where he does need help.

388
00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:05.965
But instead of treating God as something to Hughes,

389
00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:10.865
he trusts in God and his faithfulness.

390
00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:14.785
David trusts that if it is the Lord's desire for him

391
00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:18.265
to be back in Jerusalem, nothing can stop that.

392
00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:22.545
But if it is the Lord's desire for him to spend the rest

393
00:21:22.545 --> 00:21:27.505
of his days and the wilderness, nothing can stop that.

394
00:21:28.415 --> 00:21:30.465
Here we see David demonstrating his trust

395
00:21:30.605 --> 00:21:33.545
and dependence on the Lord's faithfulness.

396
00:21:33.635 --> 00:21:37.865
Let's keep moving in verse 30 through 31.

397
00:21:40.405 --> 00:21:43.625
But David went up the ascent of the amount of olives

398
00:21:45.015 --> 00:21:49.545
weeping as he went barefoot and with his head covered

399
00:21:51.045 --> 00:21:53.305
and all the people who were with him covered their heads

400
00:21:54.205 --> 00:21:57.705
and they went up weeping as they went.

401
00:21:59.085 --> 00:22:01.625
And it was told David, a hitha fell is

402
00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.625
among the conspirators with Absalon.

403
00:22:04.725 --> 00:22:08.425
And David said, oh Lord, please turn the council

404
00:22:08.445 --> 00:22:10.705
of a hitha fell into foolishness.

405
00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:15.265
David is weeping and journeying through the wilderness.

406
00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:18.785
There is no hiding how hard this is for him.

407
00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:20.865
And on top of that he hears

408
00:22:20.865 --> 00:22:24.825
that someone he trusted his counselor a HIPA fell is now

409
00:22:24.825 --> 00:22:27.305
among those rising against him.

410
00:22:28.725 --> 00:22:29.865
And how does he respond?

411
00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:33.865
Well we see the first thing he does is turn to the Lord.

412
00:22:35.045 --> 00:22:38.625
He keeps his eyes fixated on the Lord.

413
00:22:39.765 --> 00:22:41.065
He calls on the name of the Lord.

414
00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.745
Not only is he crying real tears,

415
00:22:43.855 --> 00:22:45.945
he's also crying out to God.

416
00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:51.195
We see he's worshiping in the wilderness

417
00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:53.595
and the Lord is kind

418
00:22:53.655 --> 00:22:55.395
and he actually gives us a glimpse into

419
00:22:55.395 --> 00:22:57.315
what David is praying.

420
00:22:58.045 --> 00:22:59.515
David writes Psalm three

421
00:22:59.615 --> 00:23:01.995
as he is in the wilderness fleeing from absalon.

422
00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:06.195
So as we read Psalm three together, just

423
00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:08.795
keep in mind all the things that he's going through

424
00:23:09.975 --> 00:23:12.635
and the ways he is praying to the Lord.

425
00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:18.875
Psalm three, Psalm of David when he fled from Absalon,

426
00:23:19.135 --> 00:23:22.515
his son, oh Lord,

427
00:23:23.615 --> 00:23:24.835
how many are my foes?

428
00:23:26.345 --> 00:23:30.675
Many are rising against me, many are saying

429
00:23:30.855 --> 00:23:34.315
of my soul there is no salvation for him

430
00:23:34.855 --> 00:23:37.275
and God sayah

431
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:42.595
but you, oh Lord are a shield about me,

432
00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:46.845
my glory and the lifter of my head.

433
00:23:48.685 --> 00:23:50.205
I cried aloud to the Lord

434
00:23:50.465 --> 00:23:52.525
and he answered me from his holy hill.

435
00:23:54.135 --> 00:23:58.045
Sayah, I lay down and slept.

436
00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:02.085
I woke again for the Lord sustained me.

437
00:24:03.845 --> 00:24:06.365
I will not be afraid of many thousands of people

438
00:24:06.385 --> 00:24:11.045
who have set themselves against me all around arise.

439
00:24:11.545 --> 00:24:14.085
Oh Lord, save me.

440
00:24:14.345 --> 00:24:18.045
Oh my God for you strike all my enemies on the cheek,

441
00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:20.965
you break the teeth of the wicked

442
00:24:22.165 --> 00:24:23.525
salvation belongs to the Lord.

443
00:24:24.515 --> 00:24:26.525
Your blessing beyond your people.

444
00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:30.765
These are the words of someone who is walking through

445
00:24:31.365 --> 00:24:32.485
a difficult situation

446
00:24:33.345 --> 00:24:36.205
but their eyes fully fixed on the Lord.

447
00:24:37.415 --> 00:24:40.725
These are the words of someone who is being restored

448
00:24:41.265 --> 00:24:42.765
in powerful ways.

449
00:24:44.295 --> 00:24:46.485
These are the words of someone who believes

450
00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:50.405
that God's purpose in all things is to bring restoration.

451
00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:54.525
And I wanna pause from the story for just a second

452
00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:56.845
and ask, do you believe that?

453
00:25:00.035 --> 00:25:04.135
Do you trust in God when things are going south?

454
00:25:06.835 --> 00:25:09.975
Are the challenges of life drawing you closer to the Lord

455
00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:12.535
or further away from the Lord?

456
00:25:15.085 --> 00:25:18.735
What is your response in the wilderness?

457
00:25:21.435 --> 00:25:24.335
And I want to be clear that not all

458
00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:26.175
suffering is because of sin.

459
00:25:26.565 --> 00:25:30.335
Like in David's case, we live in a fallen broken world

460
00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:34.215
where bad things happen or we will walk through trials.

461
00:25:37.315 --> 00:25:39.935
But does our dependence in the Lord grow in those seasons?

462
00:25:42.155 --> 00:25:45.495
Do we grow more selfish or do we grow more selfless?

463
00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:50.495
Do we grow more hopeful or do we grow hopeless?

464
00:25:52.535 --> 00:25:56.755
Do we try to play God and remain in control

465
00:25:57.455 --> 00:26:00.435
and maybe even grow bitter with God through these seasons?

466
00:26:02.855 --> 00:26:05.355
Do we take matters into our own hands?

467
00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:09.875
Because we see in chapter 16, starting in verse 11,

468
00:26:10.285 --> 00:26:13.075
David had a chance to take matters into his own hands.

469
00:26:14.335 --> 00:26:17.475
We see there was a man from the house of Saul who saw David

470
00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:20.315
and his companions and he cursed them.

471
00:26:21.615 --> 00:26:24.595
He called David a worthless man.

472
00:26:26.255 --> 00:26:28.355
He threw stones at David,

473
00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:31.875
he threw dust at David.

474
00:26:33.295 --> 00:26:36.395
And one of David's servants asked David, Hey,

475
00:26:36.455 --> 00:26:37.595
can I go take care of this?

476
00:26:38.855 --> 00:26:42.875
Here's how David responds in verse 11 and 12.

477
00:26:44.305 --> 00:26:46.165
And David, David said to Abha

478
00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:49.605
and to all his servants, behold,

479
00:26:50.865 --> 00:26:53.485
my own son seeks my life.

480
00:26:54.985 --> 00:26:58.845
How much more now this Benjamin Knight leave him alone

481
00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:03.725
and let him curse for the Lord has told him to.

482
00:27:04.985 --> 00:27:08.005
It may be that the Lord will look on the wrong done to me,

483
00:27:08.745 --> 00:27:11.885
but the Lord will repay me with good for his cursing.

484
00:27:12.215 --> 00:27:16.125
Today, David is surrendering.

485
00:27:17.495 --> 00:27:19.165
David is saying not my will,

486
00:27:20.025 --> 00:27:24.885
but yours, David knows that control, independence

487
00:27:25.145 --> 00:27:28.605
and pride is what got him in this situation the first place.

488
00:27:31.065 --> 00:27:35.685
And now he's fully surrendering everything over to the Lord.

489
00:27:35.685 --> 00:27:39.045
He is rediscovering his dependence.

490
00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:43.405
But like I said, not all suffering is a result of something

491
00:27:43.405 --> 00:27:45.925
that needs to be said over and over again.

492
00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:50.085
But can we still learn from David's situation? Yes.

493
00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:55.685
'cause as hard as this season was for David, we have

494
00:27:55.685 --> 00:27:59.805
to see the work the Lord is doing in his life.

495
00:28:00.985 --> 00:28:04.285
And as hard as this season is for you right now,

496
00:28:04.665 --> 00:28:08.125
my encouragement just like with this text, is to zoom out

497
00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:12.965
and to see and to hope for what the Lord may be doing.

498
00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:17.765
Because God is in the business of using

499
00:28:18.385 --> 00:28:19.845
the hardest circumstances

500
00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:23.485
to bring about the greatest restoration.

501
00:28:26.185 --> 00:28:29.125
God is in the business of using the hardest things in life

502
00:28:29.825 --> 00:28:32.645
to bring about the greatest restoration,

503
00:28:32.665 --> 00:28:34.005
the greatest growth.

504
00:28:34.705 --> 00:28:36.085
And if we look to the cross,

505
00:28:36.145 --> 00:28:39.045
we see the clearest picture of that.

506
00:28:40.465 --> 00:28:44.205
The cross shows us that Jesus took on God's judgments

507
00:28:45.425 --> 00:28:47.925
so that we could be restored.

508
00:28:49.935 --> 00:28:52.085
Jesus, who is God in the flesh,

509
00:28:52.835 --> 00:28:57.405
took on the father's judgment so that we could be restored.

510
00:28:59.065 --> 00:29:01.005
The cross is where we see judgments

511
00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:03.045
and restoration go hand in hand.

512
00:29:04.905 --> 00:29:07.965
But the one who died on the cross was not the one who needed

513
00:29:07.965 --> 00:29:09.205
to be restored.

514
00:29:10.865 --> 00:29:13.565
The one who died on the cross had no sin.

515
00:29:14.745 --> 00:29:17.725
The one who died on the cross did nothing to displease

516
00:29:18.265 --> 00:29:19.285
God the Father.

517
00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:21.845
He lived the perfect life.

518
00:29:22.025 --> 00:29:25.245
He fulfilled everything perfectly so

519
00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:27.125
that we could be.

520
00:29:31.025 --> 00:29:34.285
He was mocked, he was beaten, he was spa on.

521
00:29:34.285 --> 00:29:38.045
He was stripped of his flows and he was crucified.

522
00:29:38.945 --> 00:29:41.965
He took on judgment so that we wouldn't have to.

523
00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:46.125
But not only has he has he taken on our judgment,

524
00:29:47.455 --> 00:29:50.725
God's word promises that he will put on righteousness

525
00:29:50.785 --> 00:29:52.925
to all those who will believe.

526
00:29:52.925 --> 00:29:54.805
Second Corinthians 5 21.

527
00:29:55.985 --> 00:29:58.725
For our sake, he made him

528
00:29:58.785 --> 00:30:01.205
to be sin who knew no sin.

529
00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:07.205
So that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

530
00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:12.405
The hardest circumstance of God in the flesh, dying of death

531
00:30:12.405 --> 00:30:13.485
that he did not deserve,

532
00:30:13.755 --> 00:30:15.845
brought about the greatest restoration

533
00:30:15.955 --> 00:30:17.085
that we could ever imagine.

534
00:30:17.985 --> 00:30:19.885
Our greatest need has been met

535
00:30:19.885 --> 00:30:23.885
because of Jesus, satisfying the wrath of God,

536
00:30:24.915 --> 00:30:25.925
because of Jesus.

537
00:30:26.105 --> 00:30:27.725
We never have to taste death

538
00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:30.365
because he took it all on himself.

539
00:30:32.545 --> 00:30:35.885
And that gift, that eternal life, that salvation,

540
00:30:36.195 --> 00:30:39.765
that righteousness is offered to all those

541
00:30:39.865 --> 00:30:42.005
who would acknowledge it, they have sins,

542
00:30:43.735 --> 00:30:45.325
maybe not in the same ways as David,

543
00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:49.165
but against the same holy God.

544
00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:54.765
And that sin is worthy of judgment.

545
00:30:57.275 --> 00:31:02.125
That sin has caused a separation between us and the Father.

546
00:31:05.105 --> 00:31:09.725
But if you turn to Jesus, the one

547
00:31:09.725 --> 00:31:14.605
who took on God's judgment, you will be saved.

548
00:31:16.185 --> 00:31:18.445
One thing we have seen in Second Samuel recently is

549
00:31:18.445 --> 00:31:21.965
that God takes sin seriously

550
00:31:24.725 --> 00:31:27.545
and sin will be dealt with

551
00:31:29.885 --> 00:31:32.025
for those who have put their faith in Jesus.

552
00:31:32.205 --> 00:31:34.505
Our hope is that our sin has already been taken care of.

553
00:31:36.005 --> 00:31:37.465
We stand assured.

554
00:31:38.885 --> 00:31:42.385
But for those who have not put their faith in Jesus,

555
00:31:44.785 --> 00:31:48.565
God will judge sin just like we saw

556
00:31:48.675 --> 00:31:50.485
with David.

557
00:31:52.425 --> 00:31:55.085
But if you have trusted in the Lord through Jesus,

558
00:31:55.195 --> 00:31:58.245
what are the implications of this?

559
00:31:58.515 --> 00:31:59.805
What are we to do?

560
00:32:01.195 --> 00:32:03.445
Well, if judgment has been satisfied

561
00:32:03.585 --> 00:32:07.925
and we have been restored, where does that leave us?

562
00:32:09.555 --> 00:32:12.245
Well, the Father still wants to make us holy.

563
00:32:13.785 --> 00:32:17.685
The Father wants to draw us closer to him.

564
00:32:19.185 --> 00:32:21.965
And God as a loving father wants his children

565
00:32:22.105 --> 00:32:24.005
to share in his holiness.

566
00:32:24.545 --> 00:32:28.205
God wants us to look more and more like Christ every day.

567
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:32.485
And so if we just look at David's situation,

568
00:32:32.545 --> 00:32:35.725
we look at the cross and we can conclude that

569
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:38.325
he Hughes the hardest circumstances

570
00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:41.085
to bring about the greatest restoration,

571
00:32:42.075 --> 00:32:44.085
then we should prepare ourselves with the fact

572
00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:47.845
that the Lord may hug the situation like he did in David's

573
00:32:47.845 --> 00:32:50.565
life to bring us closer to him.

574
00:32:52.395 --> 00:32:55.405
Once again, it's not always because someone has sinned, but

575
00:32:55.405 --> 00:32:56.765
because we live in a fallen world

576
00:32:57.025 --> 00:33:00.605
and the hope that we have is that God can use all things

577
00:33:01.065 --> 00:33:02.645
to bring restoration.

578
00:33:04.225 --> 00:33:08.245
And so some of you in here have probably lost among close

579
00:33:08.245 --> 00:33:09.725
to you this past year.

580
00:33:12.255 --> 00:33:15.105
Some of you in here might have lost your

581
00:33:15.105 --> 00:33:17.465
job this past year.

582
00:33:19.255 --> 00:33:21.225
Some of you in here know someone

583
00:33:21.365 --> 00:33:23.505
or yourself are experiencing health issues

584
00:33:23.565 --> 00:33:25.905
and concerns that you would've never dreamt of.

585
00:33:27.935 --> 00:33:31.345
Some of you in here are having a relationship conflict

586
00:33:31.345 --> 00:33:32.785
and familial conflict.

587
00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:36.265
And the truth is, some of you in here may be going

588
00:33:36.265 --> 00:33:37.425
through something so hard

589
00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:40.105
that you wish you were going through what David went through.

590
00:33:40.465 --> 00:33:45.425
'cause it seems more manageable in all of these.

591
00:33:45.685 --> 00:33:48.025
Our hope is in the fact that our father in heaven

592
00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:52.825
who loves us will use all these things in powerful ways.

593
00:33:52.845 --> 00:33:56.865
He will use all these things that draw us closer to him.

594
00:33:57.855 --> 00:34:01.625
Hebrews 12 puts it best verses seven through 11.

595
00:34:03.325 --> 00:34:04.745
It is for discipline

596
00:34:05.165 --> 00:34:08.705
or training that you have to endure.

597
00:34:09.925 --> 00:34:13.825
God is treating you as sons for

598
00:34:13.905 --> 00:34:17.185
what son is there whom his father does not discipline.

599
00:34:18.525 --> 00:34:20.665
If you are left without discipline

600
00:34:21.405 --> 00:34:22.945
in which all have participated,

601
00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:26.985
then you are illegitimate children and not sons.

602
00:34:27.975 --> 00:34:31.665
Besides this, we have had early fathers who disciplined us

603
00:34:31.845 --> 00:34:35.705
and we respected them, shall we not much more be subject

604
00:34:35.705 --> 00:34:36.825
to the father of spirits

605
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:40.625
and live for they disciplined us for a short time,

606
00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:41.825
as is the best to them,

607
00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:45.345
but he disciplines us for our good

608
00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:48.185
that we may share His holiness.

609
00:34:49.605 --> 00:34:52.545
For the moment, all discipline seems painful

610
00:34:53.245 --> 00:34:54.305
rather than pleasant.

611
00:34:55.525 --> 00:34:59.065
But later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness

612
00:34:59.405 --> 00:35:01.425
to those who have been trained by it.

613
00:35:03.045 --> 00:35:06.105
It is painful. There's no hiding that fact.

614
00:35:07.045 --> 00:35:10.025
You may be in an immense amount of pain right now,

615
00:35:11.645 --> 00:35:15.465
but the hope is that it's not for nothing.

616
00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:18.265
That the Lord is using it.

617
00:35:18.645 --> 00:35:21.385
The Lord is using it to make us more righteous.

618
00:35:21.485 --> 00:35:24.105
So endure through the encouragement

619
00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:26.745
that the Lord is at work.

620
00:35:28.285 --> 00:35:31.225
If anyone's ever had surgery, you can relate to the pain

621
00:35:31.285 --> 00:35:32.865
of surgery and recovery.

622
00:35:34.045 --> 00:35:36.865
But the joy of having bones back where they should be,

623
00:35:39.695 --> 00:35:44.045
God's training, God's discipline, seasons of wilderness are

624
00:35:44.045 --> 00:35:47.325
for us to grow and share in holiness.

625
00:35:48.185 --> 00:35:49.845
But how are we to face these things?

626
00:35:51.055 --> 00:35:53.205
Three steps we can do today in this week.

627
00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:57.405
The first one can ask ourselves the question,

628
00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:02.525
how is God using this situation in my life

629
00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:05.885
to make me more like Jesus?

630
00:36:08.535 --> 00:36:12.835
How is God using this situation in my life to make me more

631
00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:14.435
like Jesus?

632
00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:15.795
'cause if we look at David's life,

633
00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:19.075
you know he was in the palace, started to drift

634
00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:21.395
going to the wilderness.

635
00:36:21.395 --> 00:36:24.275
The Lord is drawing him back to him, drawing him

636
00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.275
in powerful ways.

637
00:36:26.335 --> 00:36:29.235
So how's the Lord using the situation in your life

638
00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:31.195
to make you more like Jesus?

639
00:36:32.695 --> 00:36:33.915
The second thing we can do,

640
00:36:35.055 --> 00:36:38.395
and this one is really done well in community,

641
00:36:39.495 --> 00:36:42.635
we can remind ourselves how faithful God has been

642
00:36:43.175 --> 00:36:45.435
and put our hope in the fact that he will continue

643
00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:47.555
to be faithful.

644
00:36:50.135 --> 00:36:51.275
We can remind ourselves

645
00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:54.515
to the times God has been faithful in how he will continue

646
00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:56.915
to be faithful.

647
00:36:58.175 --> 00:36:59.835
And the last thing we can do is we,

648
00:37:00.095 --> 00:37:02.395
as we even look at Psalm three as an example,

649
00:37:03.415 --> 00:37:06.075
we can worship in the wilderness.

650
00:37:08.455 --> 00:37:11.635
We can worship in the wilderness.

651
00:37:12.935 --> 00:37:14.835
Things kept going from bad to worse.

652
00:37:15.215 --> 00:37:20.035
For David turns to the Lord, prays

653
00:37:20.035 --> 00:37:21.675
to the Lord, cries out to the Lord.

654
00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:26.195
Writes Psalm three, celebrating the fact that the Lord

655
00:37:26.775 --> 00:37:28.835
is the lifter of his head.

656
00:37:29.815 --> 00:37:31.995
The Lord is his glory.

657
00:37:32.415 --> 00:37:36.675
The Lord is his sustainer Through it all.

658
00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.635
He didn't wait until he got back to Jerusalem.

659
00:37:40.335 --> 00:37:42.355
He wrote those things in the wilderness

660
00:37:42.355 --> 00:37:46.595
through everything he was going through.

661
00:37:48.335 --> 00:37:51.315
But we need help to do that is only by God's grace,

662
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:53.155
but we can respond that way.

663
00:37:53.535 --> 00:37:55.835
And so let's pray and ask for God to bring about

664
00:37:56.345 --> 00:38:00.515
more restoration in our lives as we walk through all things.

665
00:38:03.025 --> 00:38:07.235
Lord, would you help us God?

666
00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:10.915
Would you be our sustainer? Would you be our confidence?

667
00:38:10.915 --> 00:38:14.315
Would you be the lifter of our head? Would you be our glory?

668
00:38:14.455 --> 00:38:15.715
God? Would you surround us?

669
00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:23.875
Lord, there are so many stories in this room right now

670
00:38:25.535 --> 00:38:29.235
of hard things but also of good things of Lord,

671
00:38:29.255 --> 00:38:31.555
how you have used so many things.

672
00:38:31.775 --> 00:38:34.995
God, the Bible tells us that God, that

673
00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:37.285
you use the hardest things

674
00:38:37.385 --> 00:38:39.445
to bring about the greatest restoration,

675
00:38:40.505 --> 00:38:44.125
but it's hard to believe at times to God, would you help us

676
00:38:45.465 --> 00:38:48.205
or would you surround us with people who will encourage us

677
00:38:48.875 --> 00:38:50.765
when it's hard, when it doesn't make sense?

678
00:38:52.265 --> 00:38:54.885
And then we pray, would you stand as we continue

679
00:38:54.885 --> 00:38:55.885
to worship together?
