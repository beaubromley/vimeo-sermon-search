1
00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:02.765
Jamie Authorities say this is now

2
00:00:02.845 --> 00:00:03.965
a criminal investigation.

3
00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:07.165
Several fires raging now down this street,

4
00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:09.885
smashing grab flash mob at a Nordstrom

5
00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:16.135
police, the number of homeless people on the streets

6
00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:18.695
and in shelter, medical treatment for minors,

7
00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.895
a surprise attack within Israel's borders.

8
00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:24.855
People are for a

9
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.015
And an angel of the Lord appeared to them

10
00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.295
and the glory of the Lord shown around them

11
00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:52.895
and they were filled with fear.

12
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.375
And the angel said to them, fear not for behold.

13
00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.095
I bring good news of great joy.

14
00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:08.235
Well, is it too early to say Merry Christmas?

15
00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.235
I, I don't think so, right? Is that okay?

16
00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:11.755
Some stores have been saying it

17
00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.515
for two months already, so I think we're okay.

18
00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:16.515
Uh, but no, it is, uh, one of my favorite times

19
00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:18.555
of year really is uh, not just

20
00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:21.115
'cause our oldest son was born Christmas Eve, but

21
00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:24.315
because it's just such a, a, a sense of excitement

22
00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:27.275
and anticipation and lots of joy

23
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.955
and all the things that come with this celebration time.

24
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:33.395
That's really the essence of this short Christmas series.

25
00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:35.475
We're gonna embark on this season a series

26
00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:37.915
that we're calling Good News of great joy,

27
00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:40.595
as you just saw in the bumper video there.

28
00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:43.195
That's a phrase we borrowed from the angels on the

29
00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:44.315
night Jesus was born.

30
00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:48.195
Uh, but really it, it, it talks about a, a sense of

31
00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:51.555
when we look around in the world, as you saw, like there's

32
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.115
so much chaos, so much that we can look at

33
00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:56.315
and say, man, things are not good.

34
00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.315
But there was,

35
00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:02.035
and is still good news of great joy.

36
00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.955
The reason it was such good news though,

37
00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.875
the reason it would spark great joy at the time was

38
00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.235
because of what they were waiting for back then of

39
00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:15.235
what they were anticipating in their lives.

40
00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:19.715
'cause Israel had been given promises for thousands

41
00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:23.635
of years, promises that they trusted the Lord to fulfill

42
00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:25.715
that he would come through for them.

43
00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:29.755
But, but at that time, 2000 years ago for us, but,

44
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:33.275
but at that time, he hadn't really come through yet fully.

45
00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:36.595
They were still waiting for so many things.

46
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:38.675
And then you add to that,

47
00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:42.595
for the 400 years preceding Jesus' birth,

48
00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:44.355
God had been silent.

49
00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:50.495
There was nothing they had heard about any of those promises

50
00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:53.135
or about anything that would give them hope.

51
00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:56.655
And so to them it may have seemed like

52
00:02:58.225 --> 00:02:59.685
that God had forgotten them

53
00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.725
or maybe that God had abandoned them.

54
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:10.095
Well, what we're gonna see over the next four weeks

55
00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:14.415
is four different responses to that announcement

56
00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:15.935
of good news, of great joy.

57
00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:19.675
How did four unique people in this whole

58
00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:21.355
Christmas narrative scene,

59
00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:24.315
how did they respond when they heard of this good news

60
00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:25.915
of great joy, when they heard of

61
00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.515
what Jesus' appearance was going to bring?

62
00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.195
How did they respond to that? What did it mean to them?

63
00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:36.355
And what we're gonna see, I think, is that this good news

64
00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:40.955
can bring great joy even to us today.

65
00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:45.075
And so we're gonna be in the gospel according to Luke

66
00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:48.515
for the next couple weeks, just chapters one and two.

67
00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.795
So go ahead and turn there with me, put a bookmark there

68
00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:54.195
for the next few Sundays in the New Testament, Matthew,

69
00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:55.915
mark, and then Luke.

70
00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:01.475
And we're gonna bounce around those two chapters a little

71
00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.755
bit, looking at these four characters and their responses.

72
00:04:03.755 --> 00:04:07.635
But today we're gonna look at Mary, the mother of Jesus

73
00:04:08.255 --> 00:04:11.115
and how she responded to all that she saw

74
00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:14.395
and heard about this Messiah that was promised

75
00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:15.835
that she'd heard about before,

76
00:04:15.895 --> 00:04:18.955
but then some of the direct parts of what that looks like.

77
00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:21.235
We're gonna see it in her response.

78
00:04:22.565 --> 00:04:25.995
We'll be in Luke 1 46 through 55 to see that.

79
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.275
But we gotta get some context

80
00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:29.035
before we get there of,

81
00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:31.395
of helping us see why she would've responded.

82
00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:33.235
The way that we'll see that she did,

83
00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:36.555
I already said God had been silent for 400 years.

84
00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:37.995
That means there was no prophet,

85
00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:40.635
there was no vision from God about any

86
00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:42.595
of these things in their life.

87
00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:45.955
Nothing. And so all seemed lost at that point.

88
00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:47.715
There were just a handful of people

89
00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:48.755
still kind of hanging on.

90
00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:50.235
Yet in this moment,

91
00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:56.195
not only did God show up to Zechariah

92
00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.435
and to his barren wife Elizabeth

93
00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:01.755
and promised them a son, his name was John,

94
00:05:01.815 --> 00:05:03.515
who was gonna be the forerunner of the Messiah.

95
00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:06.155
We're actually gonna study zechariah's response next week.

96
00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:09.635
But not only did God show up there to kind

97
00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:12.715
of fulfill his promise at the end of the Old Testament,

98
00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:14.435
he's showing up again here.

99
00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:17.955
But in a similar way, an angel came to Mary

100
00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:21.635
to tell her about a miraculous baby coming her way as well.

101
00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:25.115
Yes, John was coming miraculously for them.

102
00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:29.675
But here for Mary, a miraculous birth was coming.

103
00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:33.155
And this, this is again background information going back up

104
00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:35.195
to to chapter one verse 26.

105
00:05:35.265 --> 00:05:38.195
This is the scene that sets this for Mary of

106
00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:41.865
what was happening for her In the six month.

107
00:05:41.865 --> 00:05:43.985
The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city

108
00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:47.345
of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin betroth,

109
00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:50.185
to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David.

110
00:05:50.565 --> 00:05:52.105
And the Virgin's name was Mary.

111
00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:54.225
And the angel came to her

112
00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:57.285
and said, greetings, oh favored one, the Lord is with you.

113
00:05:58.185 --> 00:05:59.965
But she was greatly troubled at the saying

114
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.525
and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.

115
00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.885
And the angel said to her, do not be afraid, Mary,

116
00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:07.485
for you found favor with God

117
00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:10.125
and behold, you'll conceive in your womb

118
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:12.325
and bear a son, you shall call his name Jesus.

119
00:06:13.065 --> 00:06:15.645
He will be great. He will be called the

120
00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:16.805
son of the most high.

121
00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:19.365
And the Lord God will give to him the throne

122
00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:20.565
of his father David.

123
00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:22.645
And he will reign over the house

124
00:06:22.645 --> 00:06:25.085
of Jacob forever and of his kingdom.

125
00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.925
There will be no end.

126
00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:30.885
And Mary said to the angel, how will this be

127
00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.205
since I am a virgin?

128
00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:34.885
And the angel answered her,

129
00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:36.685
the Holy Spirit will come upon you

130
00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:39.085
and the power of the most high will overshadow you.

131
00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:42.685
Therefore, the child to be born will be called holy,

132
00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:44.565
the son of God.

133
00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:47.525
And behold, your relative, Elizabeth

134
00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:49.405
and her old age has also conceived a son.

135
00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:53.405
This is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

136
00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:57.365
For nothing will be impossible with God.

137
00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:02.505
And Mary said, behold, I am the servant of the Lord.

138
00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:05.425
Let it be to me according to your word.

139
00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:08.465
And the angel departed from her.

140
00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:11.225
Now that's the setting here

141
00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:14.145
where Mary had had this encounter with the angel.

142
00:07:14.245 --> 00:07:16.865
He told her what was happening, what was about to happen,

143
00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:18.225
all of the scenarios.

144
00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:19.705
And, and so what we learned from

145
00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.785
that is not only was was Mary informed

146
00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:24.305
and she was, she was instructed about this,

147
00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:26.745
we also learned some things about this whole process,

148
00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:28.985
about this baby that was coming.

149
00:07:30.365 --> 00:07:33.225
Notice first that this baby was the fulfillment of

150
00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:35.345
so many prophecies from the Old Testament

151
00:07:36.245 --> 00:07:37.425
and, and just a couple of those.

152
00:07:37.525 --> 00:07:39.945
He was to be of the house of David.

153
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:43.705
Remember she was betrothed to Mary Joseph

154
00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:45.465
and Joseph was of the house of David.

155
00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:46.665
It says explicitly there.

156
00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:50.465
And so this was prophesied all the way back in Jeremiah 23.

157
00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:54.345
Isaiah 11, that this was, this Messiah was to be

158
00:07:54.485 --> 00:07:55.665
of the house of David.

159
00:07:56.035 --> 00:08:00.505
There you go. It also says here that he was the son of God,

160
00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:02.185
the son of the most high.

161
00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:07.145
Well that was predicted back in Psalm two, Hosea 11,

162
00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:10.625
that this was going to be known as the son of God.

163
00:08:12.885 --> 00:08:15.905
And so Mary understood by virtue of an angel coming

164
00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:17.785
and her getting pregnant, right like that,

165
00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:19.345
that was, that was miraculous.

166
00:08:19.345 --> 00:08:20.945
This whole process was miraculous.

167
00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:22.945
Like she, she'd never seen an angel before we think.

168
00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:24.145
And so that was part of it.

169
00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:27.305
But then like this angel tells her these things

170
00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:29.025
that this is going to be the Lord.

171
00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:33.795
That baby is not just a baby, it's the Lord.

172
00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:37.915
She understood, even though she didn't understand the

173
00:08:38.115 --> 00:08:39.915
mechanics of how all this was working out,

174
00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:42.595
she understood that was happening.

175
00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:47.535
But notice throughout this passage,

176
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.865
she trusted God, right?

177
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.305
If you have to go base level, bottom line, this is

178
00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:56.165
what she shows us.

179
00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:58.285
She trusted God.

180
00:09:00.335 --> 00:09:02.395
That's why Mary responded with the way

181
00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:05.035
that we'll see her respond in our main passage here in

182
00:09:05.035 --> 00:09:06.635
verses 46 through 55.

183
00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:10.995
See, she began to understand what was happening to her life

184
00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:15.795
and look at her trust in the Lord.

185
00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:21.675
Starting in verse 46, Mary said, my soul magnifies the Lord.

186
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.435
My spirit rejoices in God, my savior,

187
00:09:25.855 --> 00:09:28.435
for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.

188
00:09:28.815 --> 00:09:29.995
For behold, from now on,

189
00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:34.155
all generations will call me blessed, for he who is mighty,

190
00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:36.075
has done great things for me.

191
00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:38.315
And holy is his name.

192
00:09:39.215 --> 00:09:40.675
And his mercy is for those

193
00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:43.235
who fear him from generation to generation.

194
00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:45.635
He has shown strength with his arm.

195
00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:48.315
He scattered the proud and the thoughts of their hearts.

196
00:09:48.825 --> 00:09:51.315
He's brought down the mighty from their thrones

197
00:09:52.495 --> 00:09:54.515
and exalted those of humble estate.

198
00:09:55.605 --> 00:09:57.545
He has filled the hungry with good things

199
00:09:58.325 --> 00:10:00.105
and the rich, he sent away empty.

200
00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:04.905
He has helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy

201
00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:07.865
as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham,

202
00:10:08.005 --> 00:10:10.185
to his offspring for her.

203
00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:15.815
Isn't that beautiful? I mean, you just look at this.

204
00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.495
I'm so thankful that God chose

205
00:10:17.515 --> 00:10:21.015
to record Mary's testimony here, like her perspective on

206
00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:23.215
what was happening in her life, what God was doing in her,

207
00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:25.135
what God was doing in history, right?

208
00:10:25.165 --> 00:10:26.335
He's, she's looking at this

209
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:28.655
and saying, here's what I see God doing.

210
00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.935
And God said, here's what I want you for generations,

211
00:10:31.935 --> 00:10:35.135
forever to know about me through Mary.

212
00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:37.815
Thank you God for that. Right?

213
00:10:39.715 --> 00:10:41.095
But as I began studying through this,

214
00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:45.575
I was noticing some things that Mary said a lot about

215
00:10:45.635 --> 00:10:48.975
how God flips stuff on its head,

216
00:10:50.285 --> 00:10:52.015
like God doesn't work in the normal ways

217
00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:53.775
that we think he would work it.

218
00:10:53.835 --> 00:10:55.935
He tends to work differently.

219
00:10:55.935 --> 00:10:57.935
That's how one commentator actually described

220
00:10:57.935 --> 00:11:00.815
what Mary was saying here, where when you take

221
00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:03.055
what she says, plus what Jesus ended up doing

222
00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:06.175
for the 33 years he was here on Earth, like

223
00:11:06.175 --> 00:11:07.295
how that all played out.

224
00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:09.895
When you take all that together, the way they said it is

225
00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:12.375
that God is the God of the upside down kingdom.

226
00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:17.975
That's what we're learning from this, is that God is the God

227
00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:21.975
of the upside down kingdom that he came,

228
00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:23.895
Jesus took on flesh.

229
00:11:24.155 --> 00:11:27.695
God the Son took on flesh, came to be with us in,

230
00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:31.535
in some sense to reverse the world's power structures

231
00:11:33.165 --> 00:11:34.215
that he doesn't work through.

232
00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:36.455
The same means that we think we should.

233
00:11:38.035 --> 00:11:39.735
And you see that throughout the passage, right?

234
00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:43.485
A lowly person like Mary exalted,

235
00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:50.065
the proud and the strong in the world scattered,

236
00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:53.815
brought down from their thrones.

237
00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:57.495
It says, the hungry

238
00:11:58.555 --> 00:12:03.325
filled the rich emptied,

239
00:12:05.685 --> 00:12:08.825
the tiny forgotten nation of Israel remembered

240
00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:14.045
and helped in a

241
00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:18.685
way you could say Jesus when he came, began a revolution.

242
00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:24.485
Now, Mary kind of implies that as we read through this,

243
00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:25.645
but Jesus himself,

244
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:29.365
just a couple chapters later in chapter four verses 18

245
00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:31.885
and 19, he stands up in the synagogue

246
00:12:31.905 --> 00:12:34.045
and he gives his mission statement.

247
00:12:35.115 --> 00:12:36.605
Basically, this is what I came to do.

248
00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:40.325
Just listen to this, Luke four 18

249
00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:42.525
and 19, the spirit of the Lord is upon me.

250
00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:43.965
He's quoting Isaiah 61.

251
00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:45.645
The spirit of the Lord is upon me

252
00:12:45.645 --> 00:12:47.125
because he has anointed me

253
00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:49.405
to proclaim good news to the poor.

254
00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:53.685
He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives

255
00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:58.045
recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those

256
00:12:58.105 --> 00:13:02.925
who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.

257
00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:06.325
Revolutionary language, right?

258
00:13:09.465 --> 00:13:13.645
See, listen, we tend to make Christmas a, a, a season

259
00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:15.845
of warm fuzzies, lights

260
00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:19.285
and traditions, cookies and presents.

261
00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:20.725
And I, I love all of those things.

262
00:13:22.055 --> 00:13:24.285
We've, we've stripped Christmas down

263
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.965
to a manageable consumeristic holiday.

264
00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:34.845
But what we need to learn here from Mary is

265
00:13:34.905 --> 00:13:38.565
how revolutionary the birth of Christ really was.

266
00:13:41.085 --> 00:13:42.725
I mean, just look at the language here, right?

267
00:13:43.475 --> 00:13:47.165
Because remember, Jesus didn't come just to restore Israel

268
00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:48.645
to its former glory.

269
00:13:49.785 --> 00:13:52.125
He didn't come just to make the atmosphere better for them

270
00:13:52.145 --> 00:13:55.285
and they could have a, a good time again like they used to.

271
00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.525
He came to do something completely different.

272
00:13:57.665 --> 00:14:02.285
He came to bring a whole new kingdom, a kingdom of love

273
00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:04.685
that was not based in the world's power structures anymore.

274
00:14:04.985 --> 00:14:07.565
In fact, it's based on something very different

275
00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:08.805
and deeper and eternal.

276
00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:11.885
It's founded on a personal relationship with God

277
00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:16.245
through faith where your sins are now covered by his blood

278
00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:18.725
and the spirit lives inside you.

279
00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:23.565
Now, that's a whole new way of doing life.

280
00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:27.905
Now. It's a new kingdom, it's a different world.

281
00:14:29.095 --> 00:14:33.225
It's eternal, it's above. It's not the world's structures.

282
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.945
And as we saw throughout Colossians, what

283
00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:40.945
that does then is it makes you different.

284
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.785
It makes us different.

285
00:14:44.765 --> 00:14:49.245
It makes you new where you start to speak differently.

286
00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:53.885
You love differently. You sing differently.

287
00:14:54.305 --> 00:14:58.005
You work differently. You forgive differently.

288
00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:02.405
Your marriage is different. Your parenting is different.

289
00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:03.885
Your singleness is different.

290
00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:06.725
Your friendships are different.

291
00:15:08.315 --> 00:15:12.445
Because remember, the old has gone, the new has come

292
00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:19.415
That inner transformation, new heart, new spirit,

293
00:15:19.595 --> 00:15:24.095
new flesh gives you changed kingdom in the world,

294
00:15:24.425 --> 00:15:26.335
gives you new life in the world,

295
00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:28.695
gives you difference in the world.

296
00:15:29.715 --> 00:15:32.175
That's what Jesus not to take over politically.

297
00:15:32.315 --> 00:15:34.255
He came to take over hearts so that

298
00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:35.935
that would change the world around them.

299
00:15:39.755 --> 00:15:42.735
But that's what kinda illustrated by this is

300
00:15:42.735 --> 00:15:44.055
what happens when this upside down

301
00:15:44.055 --> 00:15:45.335
kingdom begins to break through.

302
00:15:45.485 --> 00:15:49.975
Some things could be confusing to us at times.

303
00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:53.775
Like we don't always understand what that looks like.

304
00:15:56.025 --> 00:15:58.605
But here's one of the things that we can learn from Mary's

305
00:15:59.155 --> 00:16:02.165
song, is that God is worthy of praise.

306
00:16:02.235 --> 00:16:03.445
Even when nothing makes sense,

307
00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:10.585
like it's confusing, doesn't make sense.

308
00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:14.745
He is still worthy of praise.

309
00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.875
And look again at how she started this song.

310
00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:23.315
Verse 46 through 49, Mary said, my soul magnifies the Lord.

311
00:16:23.535 --> 00:16:26.315
My spirit rejoices in God my savior.

312
00:16:26.665 --> 00:16:28.435
He's looked on the humblest state of his servant.

313
00:16:28.665 --> 00:16:29.915
From behold, from now on,

314
00:16:29.915 --> 00:16:33.475
all generations will call me blessed, for he who is mighty,

315
00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:35.315
has done great things for me.

316
00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:38.275
And holy is his name.

317
00:16:40.025 --> 00:16:42.355
This whole section is often referred to as the

318
00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:46.075
magnifica may have heard that before.

319
00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:49.995
It's typically said about this song in this way.

320
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:51.475
Why is it called that? Because

321
00:16:51.475 --> 00:16:55.715
that's the first word in the Latin translation of this, that

322
00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:59.915
as she's saying here, my soul magnifies the Lord.

323
00:17:01.985 --> 00:17:06.325
That's a word that means to glorify, to exalt, to lift high

324
00:17:07.825 --> 00:17:09.765
or, or you might think of a magnifying glass.

325
00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:12.125
Kids, you've kids, you've used a magnifying glass

326
00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:13.285
before where you've hold it up there

327
00:17:13.285 --> 00:17:14.565
and you see something a lot closer.

328
00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.365
You're focusing in on it, right?

329
00:17:17.475 --> 00:17:18.885
That that's what this is doing.

330
00:17:19.215 --> 00:17:23.365
She's saying, my goal is to focus people's attention

331
00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:27.645
on the one who deserves it, to magnify,

332
00:17:27.675 --> 00:17:31.565
make bigger in people's hearts the Lord, Yahweh.

333
00:17:33.925 --> 00:17:36.625
And notice, again, Mary looked around at her circumstances

334
00:17:37.005 --> 00:17:39.465
and even though none of it made sense,

335
00:17:42.115 --> 00:17:44.285
even though she couldn't explain any of it,

336
00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:46.845
she still praised the Lord.

337
00:17:48.265 --> 00:17:50.965
She still said, God, you are worthy of it.

338
00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:55.125
Now, this was not new for Mary, right?

339
00:17:55.145 --> 00:17:56.445
She didn't just come up outta nowhere

340
00:17:56.585 --> 00:17:59.485
and all of a sudden be able to express these truths and

341
00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:00.885
and worship God like this.

342
00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:04.125
She had been doing this her entire life.

343
00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:09.005
She'd seen God as worthy. She loved him.

344
00:18:09.265 --> 00:18:13.605
And verse 47 says, she rejoiced in God, her savior.

345
00:18:16.825 --> 00:18:19.025
'cause remember she was looking for the Messiah too.

346
00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:22.755
And God looked at her and said, you're favored.

347
00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:24.795
You're blessed. Not so that we would worship her,

348
00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:27.315
but that that we would see her as an example.

349
00:18:31.865 --> 00:18:33.125
And what she began to realize

350
00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:37.125
as she's considering all the things that she's known

351
00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:39.445
and learned and heard her entire life,

352
00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:41.565
and now the things that are happening right now,

353
00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:44.045
what she's beginning to realize is that this baby

354
00:18:45.075 --> 00:18:49.725
that she was carrying was that Savior the Messiah

355
00:18:49.725 --> 00:18:53.645
that they were waiting for, that he was going

356
00:18:53.645 --> 00:18:58.445
to be her deliverer like the song Mary did.

357
00:18:58.445 --> 00:19:00.765
You know, yes she did.

358
00:19:02.525 --> 00:19:04.915
Maybe not all the implications, but she knew this.

359
00:19:05.025 --> 00:19:07.995
Look at what she's saying about the one that she's carrying.

360
00:19:08.175 --> 00:19:12.685
She knew. So even though none

361
00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:17.525
of Mary's circumstances made sense, she could look back at

362
00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:19.725
what God had did throughout the ages.

363
00:19:20.105 --> 00:19:21.285
She could look at what he was even

364
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.445
doing right at that moment.

365
00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:23.765
She could see all those things.

366
00:19:23.825 --> 00:19:27.045
And what she could do then is she could worship her.

367
00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:31.125
God, is

368
00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:32.405
that something that you can do?

369
00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:36.345
Are you able to do the same thing

370
00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:39.065
that she is exemplifying here?

371
00:19:39.065 --> 00:19:42.345
That even, even when nothing in your life makes sense,

372
00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:47.225
even when it all seems to be falling apart,

373
00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:50.905
are you still able to magnify the Lord

374
00:19:51.165 --> 00:19:53.905
and rejoice in the Lord your savior?

375
00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:59.275
Are you able to do what she does?

376
00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:04.815
And, and I know the stories in in part in this room,

377
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.375
you might not think right now

378
00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:08.175
that you have anything in your life

379
00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:09.415
that you could give thanks for.

380
00:20:12.475 --> 00:20:17.345
Well, listen, if you have turned from

381
00:20:17.345 --> 00:20:20.145
your sin and turned to Jesus in faith,

382
00:20:20.295 --> 00:20:23.025
there's always something that you can give thanks for.

383
00:20:23.215 --> 00:20:27.425
It's your salvation is secure in him, right?

384
00:20:27.425 --> 00:20:28.905
Even if everything's falling apart around you,

385
00:20:28.905 --> 00:20:32.705
even you have nothing else, you have a savior.

386
00:20:33.205 --> 00:20:36.865
And you can rejoice in God, your savior,

387
00:20:39.195 --> 00:20:40.325
because that's right.

388
00:20:40.475 --> 00:20:43.205
What this is is good news of great joy, right?

389
00:20:44.215 --> 00:20:46.445
We're not talking good news of great happiness

390
00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:47.770
because that's circumstantial

391
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.965
and that can be taken away as soon as you lose

392
00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:51.485
that Nintendo that you just got, right?

393
00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:53.445
Like that can be, that can be taken away.

394
00:20:55.025 --> 00:20:57.045
But joy is eternal.

395
00:20:59.145 --> 00:21:03.365
And so you have the ability to have this constant eternal

396
00:21:03.955 --> 00:21:07.005
look at things no matter what it is, which means God.

397
00:21:07.005 --> 00:21:09.805
There's always something to give praise to you

398
00:21:10.065 --> 00:21:12.085
for even when nothing makes sense.

399
00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:14.365
He is worthy of our praise.

400
00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:19.495
But there's also another part

401
00:21:19.495 --> 00:21:21.535
of this upside down kingdom that we learn from.

402
00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:25.735
Mary's song here is that he humbles the proud

403
00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:27.495
who don't trust in him.

404
00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:32.015
Remember, God is turning things on its head

405
00:21:32.475 --> 00:21:36.775
and the way that things work here, he humbles the proud

406
00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:37.975
who don't trust in him.

407
00:21:40.035 --> 00:21:41.815
And you see that throughout this passage.

408
00:21:41.965 --> 00:21:44.735
Look again, at verses 51 through 53, he has shown

409
00:21:45.535 --> 00:21:46.775
strength with his arm.

410
00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:49.495
He's scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.

411
00:21:50.125 --> 00:21:52.295
He's brought down the mighty from their thrones.

412
00:21:53.165 --> 00:21:55.135
He's exalted those of humble estate filled the hungry

413
00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:59.255
with good things, but the rich he has sent away empty.

414
00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:03.095
Like how revolutionary is that? Right?

415
00:22:03.095 --> 00:22:05.055
This is how upside down the kingdom really is.

416
00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:08.455
In fact, this section of scripture has been banned

417
00:22:08.795 --> 00:22:10.615
by communist countries throughout history.

418
00:22:10.875 --> 00:22:13.935
It has been said to missionaries in hard places, don't read

419
00:22:13.935 --> 00:22:16.575
that you're already inflammatory enough by your presence.

420
00:22:16.575 --> 00:22:20.955
Don't read that section. This is a

421
00:22:21.195 --> 00:22:23.755
revolutionary idea of what God came to do.

422
00:22:23.755 --> 00:22:27.195
This is what Jesus does. He reverses all human values.

423
00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:30.035
What the world esteems, what the world values

424
00:22:30.135 --> 00:22:32.435
and holds high, he turns it on its head.

425
00:22:35.705 --> 00:22:37.785
'cause again, remember that Rome was in charge at the

426
00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:39.225
time this was written.

427
00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:41.985
They were often oppressing the Jews.

428
00:22:42.055 --> 00:22:43.825
Even religious leadership was full

429
00:22:43.825 --> 00:22:45.985
of selfish pride at the time.

430
00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:48.065
And so for Mary to say

431
00:22:48.065 --> 00:22:51.265
that Jesus was gonna do things like scatter the proud,

432
00:22:51.715 --> 00:22:55.625
bring down those on their thrones, send the rich away empty.

433
00:22:55.885 --> 00:23:00.145
You see how revolutionary that was us Like there.

434
00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:01.745
He's poking the bear here, right?

435
00:23:05.365 --> 00:23:06.705
But again, that's what God does.

436
00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:09.785
He humbles the proud,

437
00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:13.145
because in essence, when you're prideful,

438
00:23:13.145 --> 00:23:14.385
that means you don't trust God.

439
00:23:16.765 --> 00:23:21.705
You trust yourself. That's the definition of pride, right?

440
00:23:24.865 --> 00:23:28.625
I know that's been true in my life, that I

441
00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:30.785
so often have thought that I have enough

442
00:23:31.165 --> 00:23:33.705
to accomplish whatever task is in front of me.

443
00:23:35.685 --> 00:23:36.895
I've pridefully thought

444
00:23:36.895 --> 00:23:39.495
that I could handle whatever is coming my way.

445
00:23:39.855 --> 00:23:41.775
Whatever is right there, I'm, I could handle this.

446
00:23:41.895 --> 00:23:43.855
I could be good enough. Listen, I even thought this

447
00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:45.340
for 20 some years of my, my life,

448
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.285
like I could be good enough for God to save me.

449
00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:50.965
I may never have said that to anybody,

450
00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:55.285
but that's the way I functioned, that I, I,

451
00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:57.605
I could be decent enough of a person

452
00:23:57.915 --> 00:23:59.605
that surely God would save me, right?

453
00:24:02.355 --> 00:24:05.895
Or, or even that, that I, I'm, I'm talented enough

454
00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:06.895
to make some things happen.

455
00:24:07.415 --> 00:24:08.935
I can, I can create this.

456
00:24:09.135 --> 00:24:12.295
I could, I could be skilled enough to do big things even

457
00:24:12.315 --> 00:24:14.415
for God, like in the, I could be skilled enough

458
00:24:14.415 --> 00:24:16.495
to make things happen for the Lord, right?

459
00:24:16.495 --> 00:24:21.265
That's all just pride. Because here's the reality.

460
00:24:21.755 --> 00:24:25.425
First of all, that forgets

461
00:24:26.055 --> 00:24:28.905
that God gave me everything to begin with.

462
00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:34.255
Even the abilities you have, even the mind you have,

463
00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:37.215
even the, the situation you were brought up

464
00:24:37.215 --> 00:24:38.735
in God gave you that.

465
00:24:38.755 --> 00:24:41.335
So what right? Do you have to boast about any of that?

466
00:24:45.115 --> 00:24:47.295
But also you heard it throughout that whole thing.

467
00:24:48.595 --> 00:24:52.775
It it's also just saying to God, I don't need you.

468
00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:56.055
I've got this.

469
00:25:01.795 --> 00:25:03.495
And listen, if that's at the core of

470
00:25:03.495 --> 00:25:06.265
who you are, then beware.

471
00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:11.075
Now I know 'cause I did it for a long time.

472
00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:15.955
I know you can cover it with some spiritual language, right?

473
00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:19.395
You can. You can not let that get out too publicly too much.

474
00:25:19.395 --> 00:25:21.875
Like nobody's ever gonna think that nobody, no,

475
00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:24.155
I'm never gonna say, and you can cover it,

476
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.305
but what are your motivations?

477
00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:31.705
What? What are the things that are deep in the

478
00:25:31.705 --> 00:25:32.865
core of who you are?

479
00:25:35.195 --> 00:25:38.855
That's, that's prideful. That's where you need to be. Where?

480
00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:44.965
Because God humbles the proud.

481
00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:50.995
Those who don't trust in him, God humbles.

482
00:25:53.315 --> 00:25:57.995
And so that's a warning. But also, see in the context of

483
00:25:57.995 --> 00:26:00.035
what Mary's saying this, think of the hope that

484
00:26:00.035 --> 00:26:03.115
that would've brought the Israelites in that moment, right?

485
00:26:03.115 --> 00:26:05.395
They're they're oppressed, they're cast off.

486
00:26:05.425 --> 00:26:06.755
They're pushed to the side.

487
00:26:07.785 --> 00:26:10.235
Mary stands up and says, Hey, actually this is

488
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.395
what the Messiah's coming to do.

489
00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:15.315
And they would've been like, yes, There's hope.

490
00:26:17.165 --> 00:26:18.615
Because not only does God humble,

491
00:26:18.635 --> 00:26:22.375
the proud in this upside down kingdom, he also

492
00:26:23.195 --> 00:26:25.255
exalts the humble who do trust in him.

493
00:26:28.245 --> 00:26:30.345
He will humble the proud who don't trust in him.

494
00:26:30.365 --> 00:26:34.305
But he also in the same move, exalts, the humble

495
00:26:34.765 --> 00:26:39.265
who do trust in him, who are waiting for him,

496
00:26:39.325 --> 00:26:41.145
who are looking to him

497
00:26:44.045 --> 00:26:46.575
like just remember it was in the first section, the context.

498
00:26:47.055 --> 00:26:48.095
Remember how Mary responded

499
00:26:48.095 --> 00:26:50.175
to the angel when he told her what was about to happen?

500
00:26:51.765 --> 00:26:53.375
This is back up in verse 38.

501
00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:57.215
Mary said, behold, I am the servant of the Lord.

502
00:26:57.595 --> 00:26:59.655
Let it be to me, according to your word,

503
00:27:02.735 --> 00:27:06.145
that word servant is the same word, often translated slave.

504
00:27:09.835 --> 00:27:12.255
And she says it again here in verse 48 in our section,

505
00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:14.215
that God has looked on the humble estate

506
00:27:14.275 --> 00:27:15.815
of his servant, right?

507
00:27:15.955 --> 00:27:17.655
You see the humility here?

508
00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:19.895
You see this submission to the Lord here,

509
00:27:20.045 --> 00:27:21.255
that she just comes to him

510
00:27:21.255 --> 00:27:23.415
and says, okay, God, I'm your slave.

511
00:27:24.515 --> 00:27:26.935
You are the eternal king. You're the eternal savior.

512
00:27:27.315 --> 00:27:31.455
And so I am giving you, you are worthy of my whole life.

513
00:27:35.055 --> 00:27:36.235
And so you see her humility,

514
00:27:36.235 --> 00:27:38.075
but also you see her trust in God.

515
00:27:38.215 --> 00:27:42.195
She could legitimately say to this, God, let it be

516
00:27:42.255 --> 00:27:44.595
to me according to your word.

517
00:27:44.735 --> 00:27:46.875
In other words, whatever you want,

518
00:27:47.055 --> 00:27:49.855
God, I'm yours.

519
00:27:49.885 --> 00:27:52.175
This is yours. All of life is yours.

520
00:27:55.735 --> 00:27:57.475
And listen, that's one of the most beautiful aspects

521
00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:58.835
of this whole passage today.

522
00:27:59.185 --> 00:28:02.115
When you think about who she is, think about the context

523
00:28:02.505 --> 00:28:04.835
that God is bringing salvation

524
00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:07.155
through her in a sense, right?

525
00:28:07.155 --> 00:28:10.675
Like he's bringing his savior through her body.

526
00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:13.995
Like this is amazing to think about when you think about

527
00:28:14.015 --> 00:28:15.195
how this works out.

528
00:28:15.195 --> 00:28:18.555
The beautiful passage of this is that you don't have

529
00:28:18.575 --> 00:28:21.875
to be mighty for God to use you.

530
00:28:25.025 --> 00:28:26.565
And just look at who he's using here.

531
00:28:26.755 --> 00:28:29.925
He's using an unwed pregnant teenage girl.

532
00:28:32.405 --> 00:28:33.925
Remember that could have gotten her stoned

533
00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:36.125
killed in that context.

534
00:28:39.025 --> 00:28:40.965
And yet God said, I'm gonna use this.

535
00:28:43.705 --> 00:28:45.525
You don't have to be mighty.

536
00:28:46.785 --> 00:28:48.765
You don't have to be in the perfect situation.

537
00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:50.645
You can be humble

538
00:28:50.755 --> 00:28:54.285
because look, again, verse 49, he who is

539
00:28:54.905 --> 00:28:57.205
mighty has done great things for me.

540
00:28:58.705 --> 00:29:01.565
She says that she's about to deliver Jesus.

541
00:29:03.255 --> 00:29:05.755
He who's mighty has done great things for me.

542
00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:08.075
In other words, she's saying it's all God.

543
00:29:09.195 --> 00:29:11.795
I brought nothing to the table here. This is all God.

544
00:29:12.055 --> 00:29:14.195
You don't have to be strong. Hear me on this.

545
00:29:14.195 --> 00:29:17.395
You don't have to bring all this strength.

546
00:29:20.585 --> 00:29:22.115
It's just what Paul wrote,

547
00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:24.435
one Corinthians one, and here's why.

548
00:29:25.215 --> 00:29:26.795
You don't have to bring strength to the table

549
00:29:26.935 --> 00:29:28.115
for consider your calling.

550
00:29:28.115 --> 00:29:30.115
Brothers, not many of you were wise according

551
00:29:30.115 --> 00:29:31.115
to worldly standards.

552
00:29:31.455 --> 00:29:34.075
Not many were powerful. Not many were of noble birth.

553
00:29:34.535 --> 00:29:36.635
But God chose what is foolish in the

554
00:29:36.635 --> 00:29:37.795
world to shame the wise.

555
00:29:38.295 --> 00:29:40.675
God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong

556
00:29:41.185 --> 00:29:44.485
God chose what is low despised in the world, even things

557
00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:46.085
that are not to bring to nothing, things

558
00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:48.165
that are upside down, right?

559
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:50.405
So that here's why. So

560
00:29:50.405 --> 00:29:53.765
that no human being might boast in the presence

561
00:29:53.765 --> 00:29:56.565
of God because of him.

562
00:29:56.565 --> 00:29:59.805
You're in Christ Jesus who became to us wisdom from God,

563
00:29:59.805 --> 00:30:02.085
righteousness, sanctification, redemption,

564
00:30:02.265 --> 00:30:04.165
all the things you desperately need.

565
00:30:04.305 --> 00:30:08.245
God did it so that as it is written, let the one

566
00:30:08.245 --> 00:30:09.845
who boasts boast in the Lord.

567
00:30:12.155 --> 00:30:14.375
Why does God choose to use the weak?

568
00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:18.055
Why does God choose to use the un?

569
00:30:18.355 --> 00:30:22.535
Why does he use the messes that we are? Why did he use Mary?

570
00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:26.815
Because that's how he gets the most glory.

571
00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:29.095
That's how he shows off.

572
00:30:31.035 --> 00:30:32.935
So you don't have to be strong, you don't have to be mighty.

573
00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:35.135
You don't have to have it all together. No, you need to,

574
00:30:35.155 --> 00:30:38.655
as Luke one 50 says, you need to fear him

575
00:30:39.485 --> 00:30:42.615
because his mercy is for those who fear him.

576
00:30:43.685 --> 00:30:45.975
What does it mean to fear God? It means to revere him.

577
00:30:46.155 --> 00:30:48.535
It means you don't trust yourself. You trust him.

578
00:30:48.595 --> 00:30:50.295
That's what it means to fear God.

579
00:30:50.365 --> 00:30:53.615
Because in the upside down kingdom of God,

580
00:30:54.315 --> 00:30:56.895
the way down is actually the way up.

581
00:30:59.115 --> 00:31:03.495
You get that He exalts those who humble themselves.

582
00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:06.335
He lifts up those who humble themselves.

583
00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:09.935
The way up is actually first the way down.

584
00:31:13.685 --> 00:31:15.905
That's how you're exalted. That's how you're blessed.

585
00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:17.825
That's how you're filled with good things

586
00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:19.705
that he says here through His word.

587
00:31:19.765 --> 00:31:22.265
As verse 53 says, you're hungry for him.

588
00:31:22.325 --> 00:31:23.865
You're not going to humble yourself

589
00:31:23.865 --> 00:31:25.345
before him if you're not hungry for him,

590
00:31:25.645 --> 00:31:26.865
if you don't actually want him.

591
00:31:27.965 --> 00:31:29.985
But when you are, when you do hunger

592
00:31:30.285 --> 00:31:31.665
for him, you long for him.

593
00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:32.745
You're looking for him to work.

594
00:31:34.045 --> 00:31:38.905
He fills you just like those faithful few were doing

595
00:31:39.015 --> 00:31:40.065
back in Mary's day.

596
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:44.665
They were looking, waiting, longing for this God to come.

597
00:31:47.315 --> 00:31:49.015
He exalts the humble.

598
00:31:51.555 --> 00:31:54.015
But there's one final way that this song

599
00:31:54.015 --> 00:31:56.415
of Mary illustrates this upside down kingdom.

600
00:31:57.525 --> 00:31:59.655
It's in verses 55 and 54

601
00:31:59.655 --> 00:32:01.695
and 55 here at the end of this passage

602
00:32:02.825 --> 00:32:06.775
especially says he has helped his servant Israel in

603
00:32:06.935 --> 00:32:09.775
remembrance of his mercy as he spoke to our fathers,

604
00:32:09.955 --> 00:32:12.695
to Abraham and to his offspring forever.

605
00:32:15.065 --> 00:32:18.655
Again. Remember at this time, all hope seemed lost.

606
00:32:19.715 --> 00:32:22.495
God had been silent for four centuries. Rome had taken over.

607
00:32:22.555 --> 00:32:24.095
Israel didn't really have their land

608
00:32:24.095 --> 00:32:25.655
that they'd been promised, and all this seemed

609
00:32:25.655 --> 00:32:27.015
to be out of control.

610
00:32:27.435 --> 00:32:28.855
Yet in Mary's mind,

611
00:32:29.085 --> 00:32:30.455
because of all of this,

612
00:32:30.795 --> 00:32:35.015
the revolution had started This thing's coming.

613
00:32:36.195 --> 00:32:37.975
She looked around the circumstances.

614
00:32:38.235 --> 00:32:40.725
She had this miraculous baby in her womb.

615
00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:43.005
She had John and Elizabeth's womb.

616
00:32:43.025 --> 00:32:45.325
She knew of that of what they were hearing from the angels.

617
00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:46.685
She put all this together,

618
00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:49.645
and even though it sure seemed like all was lost,

619
00:32:50.115 --> 00:32:53.525
Mary trusted that God actually does keep his promises.

620
00:32:56.685 --> 00:33:01.545
That's what she's seeing. It seemed like hope was lost.

621
00:33:02.045 --> 00:33:04.665
But she looked back and she said, oh, no, actually

622
00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:07.425
God does keep his promises.

623
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.625
That's what she's talking about with this quote.

624
00:33:12.735 --> 00:33:14.745
It's actually from Genesis 12, two.

625
00:33:14.745 --> 00:33:17.785
She's referencing that where God promised Abraham,

626
00:33:17.925 --> 00:33:21.625
the father of Israel, this back in Genesis 12, two,

627
00:33:21.825 --> 00:33:23.465
I will make of you a great nation.

628
00:33:23.905 --> 00:33:26.585
I will bless you. Make your name great so

629
00:33:26.585 --> 00:33:29.185
that you will be a blessing.

630
00:33:29.965 --> 00:33:31.705
God reiterated that promise over

631
00:33:31.765 --> 00:33:34.025
and over throughout the generations of Israel

632
00:33:34.135 --> 00:33:36.985
that he was going to mercifully deliver his people

633
00:33:37.285 --> 00:33:39.785
and then use them for his glory among the nations.

634
00:33:39.965 --> 00:33:42.465
He would send a redeemer to deliver them,

635
00:33:42.685 --> 00:33:44.465
to save them, to help them.

636
00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:47.065
He was going to do it and then use them.

637
00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:54.385
Well, Mary says, Hey, that Tom finally arrived.

638
00:33:55.495 --> 00:33:59.025
Here it is. All the stuff we've been waiting for.

639
00:33:59.175 --> 00:34:01.545
Here it is. God remembered his mercy.

640
00:34:01.805 --> 00:34:04.105
He remembered his love that would relieve suffering.

641
00:34:04.245 --> 00:34:07.025
He remembered the way that he was going to help us.

642
00:34:07.205 --> 00:34:10.145
How is he gonna help us by sending his son in the flesh?

643
00:34:13.515 --> 00:34:15.175
See, when we read this, we know

644
00:34:15.195 --> 00:34:16.735
and we tie it all with the Old Testament,

645
00:34:16.735 --> 00:34:19.695
that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of all

646
00:34:19.695 --> 00:34:21.015
of those promises.

647
00:34:21.115 --> 00:34:25.055
The promise to Abraham, the promise to Jacob, to Moses,

648
00:34:25.235 --> 00:34:28.375
to Joshua, to David, all of those promises.

649
00:34:29.065 --> 00:34:31.895
Jesus is God's mercy.

650
00:34:35.205 --> 00:34:39.385
And it says here, his mercy is for those who fear him

651
00:34:41.255 --> 00:34:44.505
from generation to generation back then, same way,

652
00:34:44.685 --> 00:34:47.705
but even today to those who fear him,

653
00:34:47.805 --> 00:34:49.705
his mercy comes.

654
00:34:52.685 --> 00:34:54.025
And so here's the reality of this.

655
00:34:57.615 --> 00:35:01.155
God still humbles the proud who don't trust in him.

656
00:35:05.495 --> 00:35:07.035
His strength will still scatter.

657
00:35:07.035 --> 00:35:09.235
Those who turn their backs on him,

658
00:35:10.805 --> 00:35:12.705
his judgment will come on those

659
00:35:12.805 --> 00:35:15.265
who stiffen their neck against God.

660
00:35:17.845 --> 00:35:20.625
And I know that some of you in this room fall into

661
00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:25.395
that category where there's a, a measure

662
00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:28.315
of, of, yeah, you've lived a decent life.

663
00:35:30.135 --> 00:35:31.675
You, you might even be a church member.

664
00:35:35.035 --> 00:35:36.975
You might be better than the jerk down the street

665
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.910
who you know, man, he's way far from God.

666
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.725
But I'm not, listen, if

667
00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:49.085
if your heart inside of you is still opposed

668
00:35:49.385 --> 00:35:51.725
to God, if you've turned your back on God, I said,

669
00:35:51.725 --> 00:35:52.845
no, I'm doing it my way.

670
00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.365
I'm gonna give you a little bit here and there,

671
00:35:54.365 --> 00:35:56.005
but I'm not gonna give you anything

672
00:35:56.065 --> 00:35:57.205
that's really gonna count

673
00:35:57.265 --> 00:36:00.725
or cost me anything if I'm not gonna submit my life to him.

674
00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:01.805
Listen, it doesn't matter.

675
00:36:01.825 --> 00:36:03.805
All those other things that you do, it's not enough.

676
00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:07.125
You can do as much as you want.

677
00:36:07.315 --> 00:36:08.765
It's not enough to

678
00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:14.125
overcome your rebellion in your heart towards a holy God.

679
00:36:19.205 --> 00:36:20.545
And so you ought to fear God.

680
00:36:21.935 --> 00:36:25.665
Fear his strong arm, fear his judgment.

681
00:36:30.715 --> 00:36:33.215
But notice his mercy is for those who fear him

682
00:36:35.755 --> 00:36:39.375
and and so, so yes, he humbles those who exalt themselves,

683
00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:43.135
but, but he elevates exalts, those

684
00:36:43.235 --> 00:36:47.135
who humble themselves, who, who look at his life, death

685
00:36:47.135 --> 00:36:51.175
and resurrection in their place and say, God, I am yours.

686
00:36:51.735 --> 00:36:54.335
I need that. I can't do anything myself.

687
00:36:54.495 --> 00:36:59.325
I need you to do it for me. He lifts those up.

688
00:37:01.795 --> 00:37:05.765
That's salvation. And if you're hungry for him,

689
00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:08.125
he'll fill you with those good things like love and joy

690
00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:10.725
and peace and patience, all of the fruit of the spirit.

691
00:37:10.725 --> 00:37:12.605
He's gonna fill you with that. That's what he does.

692
00:37:12.985 --> 00:37:15.965
To exalt the humble, to lift up those who trust him,

693
00:37:16.145 --> 00:37:19.085
who say, God, you are my Lord, my savior.

694
00:37:19.505 --> 00:37:22.765
I'm all in. He exalts and lifts up.

695
00:37:26.575 --> 00:37:27.715
See, listen, you might think,

696
00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:29.715
and you've been in church maybe here and there,

697
00:37:29.715 --> 00:37:31.395
and you've kind of known some of these truths

698
00:37:31.395 --> 00:37:33.835
and you kind of like Christmas and Easter,

699
00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:35.675
but you don't really know if you're in on this stuff.

700
00:37:36.335 --> 00:37:37.995
But then at the same time, you're exhausted

701
00:37:37.995 --> 00:37:40.515
because you've been trying so hard to make it work yourself.

702
00:37:42.855 --> 00:37:45.915
You might get to a place where you think like all is lost,

703
00:37:49.385 --> 00:37:50.395
that I've gone too far.

704
00:37:51.835 --> 00:37:53.475
I can never be loved like that.

705
00:37:57.775 --> 00:38:02.475
You saw it before. Nothing is impossible with God.

706
00:38:04.485 --> 00:38:07.095
Even the salvation of you

707
00:38:07.275 --> 00:38:09.295
and you think you're the worst sinner ever.

708
00:38:11.505 --> 00:38:13.275
Nothing is impossible with God.

709
00:38:17.585 --> 00:38:21.485
He will lift up those who trust in him.

710
00:38:24.215 --> 00:38:25.435
If you turn from your sin

711
00:38:25.615 --> 00:38:30.435
and you turn to Jesus in faith, you are safe forever.

712
00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:36.765
But I also wanna talk to you believer

713
00:38:39.545 --> 00:38:42.955
that I think this speaks to us in a way that we look

714
00:38:42.955 --> 00:38:46.195
around at our lives, can look at life,

715
00:38:46.255 --> 00:38:49.635
and it feels like everything's fallen apart,

716
00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:54.275
that the darkness is winning it.

717
00:38:54.275 --> 00:38:56.115
It can feel like there's no hope

718
00:38:56.455 --> 00:38:58.755
for your situation to get any better.

719
00:38:59.025 --> 00:39:00.355
It's just the way it's gonna be.

720
00:39:01.035 --> 00:39:04.875
Remember first, this God is worthy of your praise.

721
00:39:05.105 --> 00:39:06.555
Even when nothing makes sense,

722
00:39:08.785 --> 00:39:10.595
even when it seems like it's all fallen apart,

723
00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:13.355
he's still worthy of praise.

724
00:39:13.695 --> 00:39:15.475
But also, remember this, the last thing

725
00:39:15.475 --> 00:39:19.115
that she said in her song, God does keep his promises

726
00:39:22.135 --> 00:39:23.705
even when all seems lost,

727
00:39:24.055 --> 00:39:27.825
even when it seems like death is winning and death is all.

728
00:39:27.825 --> 00:39:30.905
You know, even when there's seemingly no light at the end

729
00:39:30.905 --> 00:39:34.185
of the tunnel, he keeps his promises

730
00:39:34.185 --> 00:39:36.745
because he's the God of the upside down kingdom here.

731
00:39:37.925 --> 00:39:39.465
He doesn't work according to our ways.

732
00:39:39.605 --> 00:39:41.385
He doesn't work according to our timelines,

733
00:39:43.285 --> 00:39:44.865
But here's what we do.

734
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:47.265
No, he's not concerned primarily with our comfort.

735
00:39:47.495 --> 00:39:49.345
He's primarily concerned with our holiness.

736
00:39:50.485 --> 00:39:52.065
So he's gonna work it all out.

737
00:39:52.205 --> 00:39:55.745
As Romans eight says, for the good of those who love him

738
00:39:55.925 --> 00:39:57.865
and are called according to his purpose,

739
00:39:58.285 --> 00:39:59.865
you can trust him in that,

740
00:39:59.865 --> 00:40:03.025
that he is actually working in all of the chaos

741
00:40:03.165 --> 00:40:04.785
and darkness for something good.

742
00:40:04.805 --> 00:40:08.225
If you love him, it takes trust, right?

743
00:40:09.415 --> 00:40:12.625
That doesn't automatically happen. It takes trust.

744
00:40:12.935 --> 00:40:15.105
Mary looked at her life, looked at her history,

745
00:40:15.105 --> 00:40:17.345
looked at her people's history, and said, okay, God's good.

746
00:40:17.445 --> 00:40:21.545
I'm gonna trust him. And he fulfilled his promises.

747
00:40:21.545 --> 00:40:22.625
Here's what you need to say.

748
00:40:25.425 --> 00:40:28.365
You need to say with Mary that you are

749
00:40:29.065 --> 00:40:30.765
the servant of the Lord.

750
00:40:31.785 --> 00:40:36.405
And your desire above all else is for the will of God

751
00:40:36.585 --> 00:40:38.285
to be done in your life.

752
00:40:38.385 --> 00:40:41.685
That's it. God, I don't,

753
00:40:41.765 --> 00:40:42.885
I don't know what else you're gonna do.

754
00:40:42.925 --> 00:40:44.045
I dunno how this all gonna work out,

755
00:40:44.225 --> 00:40:47.965
but God, my desire is for you to be magnified

756
00:40:47.965 --> 00:40:50.165
through my life, even if it means I suffer,

757
00:40:50.315 --> 00:40:51.765
even if it means it hurts a little bit.

758
00:40:52.045 --> 00:40:53.845
I know you deserve the glory, not me.

759
00:40:53.945 --> 00:40:58.245
So I'm gonna trust you with it, And I'm gonna trust you

760
00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.485
that one day it's all gonna work out.

761
00:41:00.915 --> 00:41:03.725
Even if that means nothing in this life ever works out one

762
00:41:03.725 --> 00:41:05.605
day, it's going to when Jesus returns

763
00:41:05.665 --> 00:41:07.165
and all things are made right again.

764
00:41:08.935 --> 00:41:10.315
And I trust you with that God.

765
00:41:12.535 --> 00:41:13.995
And even if you think right now

766
00:41:13.995 --> 00:41:18.515
that you're too insignificant, how could God ever use me?

767
00:41:18.615 --> 00:41:21.595
How could God ever want to use somebody like me?

768
00:41:21.595 --> 00:41:25.555
Listen, that's the kind of person God loves to use

769
00:41:25.895 --> 00:41:28.595
for his glory, to advance his kingdom.

770
00:41:32.475 --> 00:41:37.325
So don't feel like you can't be used what he wants to use

771
00:41:37.425 --> 00:41:40.325
as someone who is devoted to him.

772
00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:47.665
May it be so of us church individually

773
00:41:48.725 --> 00:41:52.585
and all of us together devoted to this Lord.
