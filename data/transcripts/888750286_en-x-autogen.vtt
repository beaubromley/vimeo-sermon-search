00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:17.125
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:28.045
Morning. My name is Mark Wood.

7
00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.045
I'm an elder here at Henderson Hills for the past couple

8
00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:34.605
of years and it's a privilege to get to present God's word

9
00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:36.685
to you today from Psalm 63.

10
00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:38.885
Um, Amy

11
00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:42.405
and I, my wife have been members, uh, from about 2005

12
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.565
or oh six and uh, we have three grown kids

13
00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:47.005
and I like to run.

14
00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:49.405
And uh, so those are the things you

15
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:50.845
probably need to know about me.

16
00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:55.365
Um, today we're gonna look at Psalm 63

17
00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:58.005
and if you can stand, would you please stand

18
00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.805
as we read Psalm 63.

19
00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:10.725
It says that this is a Psalm

20
00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:12.885
of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

21
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:16.365
Oh God, you are my God.

22
00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:19.565
Earnestly I seek you my soul thirsts for you.

23
00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.325
My flesh faints for you as in a dry

24
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.325
and weary land where there is no water.

25
00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:28.445
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary beholding your

26
00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:31.565
power and glory because your steadfast

27
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:32.645
love is better than life.

28
00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:37.205
My lips will praise you, so I will bless you as long

29
00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.005
as I live in your name.

30
00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:40.645
I will lift up my hands.

31
00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:45.005
My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food.

32
00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:46.965
And my mouth will praise you

33
00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:49.965
with joyful lips when I remember you upon my bed

34
00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:53.285
and meditate on you in the watches of the night.

35
00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.205
For you have been my help.

36
00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:58.285
And in the shadow of your wings, I will sing for joy.

37
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.525
My soul clings to you. Your right hand upholds me.

38
00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.285
But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down

39
00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:08.405
into the depths of the earth.

40
00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.485
They shall be given over to the power of the sword.

41
00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:14.205
They shall be a portion for jackals,

42
00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:17.005
but the king shall rejoice in God.

43
00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:20.885
All who swear by him shall exalt for the mouths

44
00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:22.285
of liars will be stopped.

45
00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:26.245
Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word.

46
00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:27.525
That's powerful and true.

47
00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:30.965
We thank you for this record of David's life

48
00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:33.805
and we look for your Holy Spirit to teach us

49
00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:37.165
and to show us how to apply this scripture so

50
00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:41.245
that we can live in victory in Christ's name.

51
00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:43.445
Amen. You can be seated.

52
00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:49.605
Well, most of your Bibles will say that this was a Psalm

53
00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:50.925
of David as it said that

54
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:52.525
as he was heading into the wilderness

55
00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:55.725
and the wilderness of Judea is south of Jerusalem.

56
00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:57.965
He was fleeing someone at the time.

57
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.965
And there are two thoughts about who this might be.

58
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:04.725
The first thought is that in first, uh, second Samuel 15

59
00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:08.085
through 18, David was fleeing Absalom, his son

60
00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:10.365
as he rushed into the desert

61
00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:12.445
to get away from Absalom's wrath

62
00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:14.725
as he overtook the kingdom temporarily.

63
00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:18.445
And then other scholars think that maybe this was the record

64
00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:20.125
of David fleeing Saul.

65
00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:22.485
And there's a whole nother passage

66
00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:25.205
of scripture one Samuel 16 through 31,

67
00:03:25.535 --> 00:03:28.605
where David is fleeing Saul on multiple occasions.

68
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:31.565
But needless to say, David is fleeing.

69
00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:32.965
He's fleeing for his life.

70
00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:35.085
He's headed out away from everything

71
00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:38.725
that he knows from the comforts of home, from his friends,

72
00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:41.605
from food, and he's headed into the wilderness.

73
00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:45.845
And you might ask, well, what is the wilderness?

74
00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:51.805
It's a place with no food or water, no shelter, no friends.

75
00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:55.805
And maybe most importantly no place,

76
00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:57.485
no formal place of worship.

77
00:03:57.985 --> 00:04:00.565
The arc of the covenant was back in Jerusalem.

78
00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:04.005
The tabernacle at the time is back in Jerusalem.

79
00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:06.685
And David is leaving all of these things,

80
00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:09.325
these familiar things that were things of comfort,

81
00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:10.605
but also things of worship.

82
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:13.845
And he's fleeing into a lonely place

83
00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:16.725
that can be lonely and dangerous.

84
00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:20.245
So he's writing of this desert experience,

85
00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:22.605
this very real physical desert.

86
00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:26.925
But he's also talking about some things that are deeper,

87
00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:32.445
some separation from things that comfort is soul.

88
00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:37.805
And maybe some of you are fleeing some things today.

89
00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:41.005
Perhaps you're in a wilderness experience also.

90
00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:44.005
Perhaps you have some hurts

91
00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:45.245
or some fearful things

92
00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:47.045
that you're struggling with some health issues.

93
00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:49.005
Perhaps you have a loved one

94
00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:53.565
or a job that is hard to deal with right now

95
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:55.725
or something painful, physical

96
00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:58.965
and emotional, something that you are struggling with.

97
00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:02.365
Certainly the trials of life can feel like we're lacking

98
00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:05.325
or alone, feel like we're struggling on our own

99
00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:08.125
or that someone is out there to harm us.

100
00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:12.285
I've got two examples of struggles that I've dealt with.

101
00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:13.925
One is kind of funny I think,

102
00:05:13.945 --> 00:05:16.765
and the other is just dealing with life.

103
00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:18.725
But the funny one is, uh,

104
00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:21.485
I've run the Pallo Dura Canyon race a couple of times.

105
00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:25.765
The pal Dura Canyon is a canyon in Texas near Amarillo

106
00:05:26.065 --> 00:05:27.765
and it's kind of desert-like,

107
00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:31.165
and they have races there that people voluntarily sign up

108
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:33.205
for to go run, believe it or not.

109
00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:37.245
And I remember the last time I ran the 50 K race,

110
00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:40.605
it was hot, it was dry.

111
00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:44.765
And on the second lap of 17 miles,

112
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.925
my fingers looked like sausages.

113
00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:52.565
And I was wondering why did I do this? But you know what?

114
00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:53.965
I signed up for it.

115
00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:57.380
And the only people that were behind me were the few people

116
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.205
that I'd been able to pass along the way

117
00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:00.845
that weren't as fast as me.

118
00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:02.765
Nobody was chasing me to kill me.

119
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:05.605
There were water stops along the way for me

120
00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.845
and I could have stopped at any point in time.

121
00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:11.445
So that's the funny wilderness experience.

122
00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:14.165
But I think many of you may have other

123
00:06:14.405 --> 00:06:17.445
experiences like this One.

124
00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:22.365
Another wilderness experience for me is just some

125
00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:24.045
of the things that life brings

126
00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:26.525
that make your soul feel dry and hungry.

127
00:06:28.165 --> 00:06:30.445
I know that over the past several years I've

128
00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:31.685
lost some close friends.

129
00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:34.725
They've either passed or moved away

130
00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:38.405
and I feel some sense of aloneness and abandonment

131
00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:39.885
because I don't have them anymore.

132
00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:44.845
They're not close. I've had some health issues,

133
00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:46.165
nothing real serious,

134
00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:51.645
but things that change my capabilities, I can't sustain some

135
00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:52.925
of the things that I used to do.

136
00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.125
I can't do some things.

137
00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:56.045
And those are changes that are forever.

138
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.085
And I look back on my youth

139
00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:00.085
and I long for some of those things

140
00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:03.925
or I've made some professional changes

141
00:07:04.595 --> 00:07:07.485
that have changed my perspective on my job.

142
00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:08.925
And I'm looking at the end now.

143
00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:12.445
You know, I'm looking at retirement somewhere out there

144
00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:13.805
in the next several years.

145
00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:15.485
And so I wonder if the changes

146
00:07:15.515 --> 00:07:17.805
that I've made have prepared me.

147
00:07:18.145 --> 00:07:21.445
As I look at retirement, there are questions

148
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:22.565
that leave me unsettled.

149
00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:24.845
There're issues that make me feel alone.

150
00:07:25.015 --> 00:07:27.845
There are things that make me long for fellowship

151
00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:30.725
and I wonder how is God leading me

152
00:07:30.725 --> 00:07:32.085
through these hard things?

153
00:07:33.665 --> 00:07:38.085
If we look back to what David wrote, he stated in verse one

154
00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:41.885
that his flesh was fainting and the land was dry

155
00:07:41.945 --> 00:07:43.285
and weary with no water.

156
00:07:43.585 --> 00:07:46.605
And this is definitely an true physical picture

157
00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:50.285
of the landscape, what it looked like around him,

158
00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:51.405
what he was going through.

159
00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:54.245
But again, the psalm is looking deeper than just the

160
00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:57.365
physical circumstances because David faced a lot

161
00:07:57.365 --> 00:07:58.725
of this for many years.

162
00:07:59.485 --> 00:08:01.925
I don't wanna minimize the circumstances that he faced,

163
00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:05.725
but what we're going to see is that David was dealing

164
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:06.965
with some issues of his heart

165
00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:08.965
and we're gonna get a glimpse into his heart

166
00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:12.045
and mind as he approached his relationship with God.

167
00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:14.725
And so that's kind of what I wanna look at today.

168
00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:17.885
As we look at Psalm 63, there are four things

169
00:08:17.885 --> 00:08:20.885
that I hope we can learn today from Psalm 63.

170
00:08:21.575 --> 00:08:23.525
First, I want us to see that

171
00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:28.925
in our wilderness experience, whatever we're dealing with,

172
00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:30.725
that God is present

173
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.525
and powerful, God is

174
00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:36.405
present and powerful.

175
00:08:38.175 --> 00:08:40.045
Let's look at verse one, how that it starts.

176
00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:44.885
Data starts with the Psalm saying, God, you are my God.

177
00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:50.345
The word, the first word for God is Elohim.

178
00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:53.825
It's the great and mighty powerful God,

179
00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:57.685
the Almighty God, the only God.

180
00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:03.245
And David is saying that you the mighty, all powerful, only

181
00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:05.885
magnificent God are my God.

182
00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:08.645
I belong to you and I acknowledge you.

183
00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:13.165
I know that you are powerful. I'm on the run.

184
00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:14.445
People wanna kill me.

185
00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:16.885
I'm rejected by so many other people

186
00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:20.085
but you, you are my God.

187
00:09:20.985 --> 00:09:25.925
In the midst of this wilderness, I'm seeking you.

188
00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:28.845
One of the ways that many

189
00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:31.205
of us might handle our wilderness experience is

190
00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:33.005
to just look at the circumstances

191
00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:36.445
and be overcome by the circumstances that we face.

192
00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:39.765
We might like me look for the way out.

193
00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.765
Be sure I've got all the angles covered.

194
00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:44.445
Look for the ways to protect myself.

195
00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:48.485
And while we certainly did be aware of how to face the

196
00:09:49.275 --> 00:09:51.965
realities of life, the psalmist is reminding us

197
00:09:52.035 --> 00:09:56.245
that in times like this, we need to remember that God is God

198
00:09:56.785 --> 00:09:57.845
and ever present

199
00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.445
and he's the same powerful God in the midst

200
00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:02.605
of these circumstances that he was

201
00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:06.725
before we entered the circumstances, he's present

202
00:10:06.865 --> 00:10:09.605
and he hasn't left us alone and he's powerful.

203
00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:13.365
What David is showing us is that in the midst of this,

204
00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:14.845
we can have fellowship with him

205
00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:16.645
as we go through this struggle.

206
00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:20.165
The Psalmist says in the middle of his trial,

207
00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:22.365
earnestly, I seek you.

208
00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:27.885
This earnestness is a a eager pursuit,

209
00:10:28.365 --> 00:10:31.725
a struggle looking for God, desiring God.

210
00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:35.525
It's the it. He gives it the picture that we all know

211
00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:37.125
what it feels like to be thirsty.

212
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:39.365
It's this longing for fellowship with God.

213
00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:41.645
It's a fleshly discomfort that we can relate

214
00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:43.325
to deep down in our spirits.

215
00:10:44.755 --> 00:10:46.525
This could be compared to the parable

216
00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:48.005
of the woman that you remember.

217
00:10:48.025 --> 00:10:50.365
She had 10 coins and she lost one of them.

218
00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:53.925
And it says that she eagerly diligently searched the house

219
00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:56.525
looking until she found the coin.

220
00:10:57.065 --> 00:11:00.005
And of course the difference in that parable is

221
00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:01.605
that the coin was lost

222
00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:05.645
and she was searching for something that was lost for us.

223
00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:06.965
We can be assured

224
00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:10.045
that we are never lost from God's presence.

225
00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:14.405
If he is your savior, he never leaves us alone.

226
00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:20.125
Proverbs 1810 reminds us that the name

227
00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:22.445
of the Lord is a strong tower.

228
00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:27.205
The righteous man or the Godly person runs to it

229
00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:28.485
and is protected.

230
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:33.045
And so in the midst of our wilderness, we run

231
00:11:33.065 --> 00:11:35.605
to our faithful protecting powerful God.

232
00:11:36.265 --> 00:11:38.165
So to follow David's example, as he goes

233
00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:41.645
through his wilderness, he's enthusiastically seeking

234
00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:45.245
to draw near to God for safety, for sustenance.

235
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.845
And as we'll see a little bit later for worship,

236
00:11:48.425 --> 00:11:51.005
he describes his need for fellowship with God

237
00:11:51.005 --> 00:11:53.005
because his soul is empty and dry

238
00:11:53.985 --> 00:11:56.965
and he recognizes this deep need for God.

239
00:11:57.315 --> 00:11:59.765
It's like a deep craving for water, food,

240
00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:01.365
shelter, and safety.

241
00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:05.605
He's craving really for something that only God can give

242
00:12:05.605 --> 00:12:07.965
to him and that's what he's acknowledging.

243
00:12:08.585 --> 00:12:09.685
So what does David do?

244
00:12:10.505 --> 00:12:14.485
He remembers the times of worship in the tabernacle

245
00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:17.365
in the middle of his wilderness.

246
00:12:17.785 --> 00:12:19.045
He remembers this picture.

247
00:12:19.945 --> 00:12:23.005
He says, so I have looked upon you

248
00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:28.085
in the sanctuary beholding your power and glory.

249
00:12:28.825 --> 00:12:32.525
The word so here means in the same way, just

250
00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:34.685
as I looked at you when I was in Jerusalem,

251
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:36.965
I was looking at you in the tabernacle.

252
00:12:37.345 --> 00:12:41.085
So here in the middle of this desert, I'm looking to you.

253
00:12:41.705 --> 00:12:43.445
I'm looking for your presence.

254
00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:46.845
I'm seeking you in the middle of this desert.

255
00:12:48.705 --> 00:12:51.365
At that time, the tabernacle

256
00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:53.925
and the Ark of the Covenant represented

257
00:12:54.095 --> 00:12:55.285
God's presence for the people.

258
00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:57.165
It's where God's power

259
00:12:57.465 --> 00:12:59.965
and glory was displayed in times of peace.

260
00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:02.885
Imagine David worshiping at

261
00:13:02.885 --> 00:13:05.725
that time in the tabernacle there would be songs,

262
00:13:05.815 --> 00:13:09.405
there would be trumpets, harps, there would be incense,

263
00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:12.565
there would be the smell of sacrifices, the bleeding

264
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.565
of the animals that were coming in to be sacrificed.

265
00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:17.885
There would be crowds rushing around him.

266
00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.365
And David is remembering all of this as he is in the middle

267
00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:25.245
of the desert, remembering that God's presence was real

268
00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:27.485
and that he can have this,

269
00:13:27.555 --> 00:13:30.605
even though he doesn't have the formal things of worship

270
00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:33.485
around him, he can have God's presence with him

271
00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:36.125
as he is in the desert, in the wilderness.

272
00:13:37.305 --> 00:13:38.765
So the day, the reason

273
00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:41.925
that David can approach God this way is clarified

274
00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:43.005
for us in verse three,

275
00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:47.445
because your steadfast love is better than life.

276
00:13:47.985 --> 00:13:49.325
My lips will praise you.

277
00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:54.645
Is there anything that is better than life? Yes.

278
00:13:54.735 --> 00:13:59.645
David says, your steadfast love is better than life.

279
00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:05.285
He uses the word here in the scripture, it says, has said,

280
00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:09.725
and for us has said is translated with two words

281
00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:11.845
steadfast love.

282
00:14:12.555 --> 00:14:14.005
What does steadfast mean?

283
00:14:15.115 --> 00:14:19.525
It's the surety, the faithfulness of God, the the sureness

284
00:14:19.905 --> 00:14:21.645
of the one that we are following.

285
00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:26.085
It's the sureness that God will fulfill, the obligation

286
00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:28.765
that he's made to those that he's called.

287
00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:31.205
It's a sure thing.

288
00:14:32.275 --> 00:14:35.405
It's like some of you may remember the ads, the rock

289
00:14:35.405 --> 00:14:36.565
of the of Gibraltar.

290
00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.965
It's the sure rock that will always be there.

291
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:41.445
That's why you should have Prudential insurance.

292
00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:46.565
I'm not making a plug, but more commonly

293
00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:49.045
for us, it's the sureness

294
00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:50.805
that the day is gonna happen again tomorrow.

295
00:14:51.055 --> 00:14:52.485
We're gonna have a sunrise tomorrow.

296
00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:57.365
The sun will come up as long as God intends for it to,

297
00:14:57.735 --> 00:14:58.805
there will be a sunrise.

298
00:15:01.185 --> 00:15:04.965
God is sure he is faithful. He will follow through.

299
00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:08.485
And the word love, what does that mean for us?

300
00:15:09.115 --> 00:15:11.005
Well, for us, who are his followers?

301
00:15:12.355 --> 00:15:14.925
It's God's affection towards us.

302
00:15:15.345 --> 00:15:19.045
His goodness and kindness, his good intentions,

303
00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:23.805
his favorable disposal towards us, the way

304
00:15:23.805 --> 00:15:25.925
that he deals with those whom he's called.

305
00:15:27.025 --> 00:15:31.205
So David is looking to God in his steadfast love

306
00:15:31.225 --> 00:15:33.925
and he can be confident as he goes through his desert

307
00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:36.685
because he realizes that God has

308
00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:39.165
steadfast love towards him.

309
00:15:40.645 --> 00:15:42.345
We can find the same kind

310
00:15:42.345 --> 00:15:46.025
of truth proclaimed in the New Testament in verses like

311
00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:51.065
Romans 8 28, God is working all things together

312
00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:54.825
for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.

313
00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:59.015
Does it mean that you won't experience hard things?

314
00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:00.855
No, you're gonna experience hard things,

315
00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:05.095
but God's favorable disposition towards you is there.

316
00:16:06.035 --> 00:16:08.895
And the sureness of his promise is there.

317
00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:12.815
He will show his steadfast love to those

318
00:16:12.835 --> 00:16:14.335
who are called according to his purpose

319
00:16:16.755 --> 00:16:18.015
in the middle of the wilderness.

320
00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:20.255
David Basks in God's loving kindness

321
00:16:20.395 --> 00:16:22.175
and care for him, knowing that

322
00:16:22.725 --> 00:16:25.215
this love is better than life.

323
00:16:26.115 --> 00:16:27.575
And so he praises God.

324
00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:30.975
So first, remember that God is present

325
00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:34.655
and powerful no matter what the circumstances look like.

326
00:16:36.265 --> 00:16:38.125
The second thing that this passage brings

327
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:42.085
to our attention is how we relate to God in worship.

328
00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:45.725
And it makes it clear that God can be worshiped both in

329
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.245
community, as we talked about in the temple.

330
00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:49.685
It was a tabernacle at the time,

331
00:16:50.345 --> 00:16:52.605
but also in solitude in the wilderness

332
00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:53.965
experiences that we go through.

333
00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:56.245
David cried out in verse two.

334
00:16:56.585 --> 00:16:59.205
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary beholding

335
00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:00.445
your power and glory.

336
00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:02.365
He's worshiped in crowds

337
00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:04.205
with priests performing all their duties

338
00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:06.285
and all of the things we described earlier.

339
00:17:06.575 --> 00:17:09.405
David remembers all these formal worship experiences.

340
00:17:09.865 --> 00:17:11.885
And in the New Testament we're reminded

341
00:17:11.995 --> 00:17:15.405
that we should have the same kinds of worship experiences

342
00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:19.325
verses like Colossians three 16, let the word

343
00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:22.445
of Christ dwell in you richly teaching

344
00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:26.605
and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing Psalms

345
00:17:26.605 --> 00:17:28.485
and hymns and spiritual songs

346
00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:30.405
with thankfulness in your hearts to God.

347
00:17:31.105 --> 00:17:32.565
Is that not what we've done this morning

348
00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:34.685
with all the beautiful songs that we sang earlier,

349
00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:36.925
reminding us of God's faithfulness,

350
00:17:37.545 --> 00:17:40.205
his favorable disposition towards us.

351
00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:43.265
And then Hebrews 10, 24

352
00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:46.465
and 25, let us consider how to stir one another up

353
00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:47.985
to love and good works.

354
00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:51.725
Not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some,

355
00:17:52.225 --> 00:17:53.525
but encouraging one another

356
00:17:53.585 --> 00:17:55.605
and all the more as you see the day drawing near.

357
00:17:56.705 --> 00:17:59.925
So just like David, we can get a sense that we need

358
00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:03.205
to meet together, we need to come together to worship,

359
00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:08.205
for teaching, for singing, for mutual encouragement

360
00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:09.685
as we worship God.

361
00:18:11.435 --> 00:18:14.895
But we also know that we should worship God when we're alone

362
00:18:15.905 --> 00:18:17.095
daily as we live.

363
00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:19.415
And most certainly when we're going

364
00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:21.255
through our wilderness experiences.

365
00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:24.535
The best example we have of this is Jesus.

366
00:18:25.885 --> 00:18:29.175
Mark 1 35 through 37 tells us

367
00:18:29.955 --> 00:18:32.215
and rising early in the morning while it was still

368
00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:33.455
dark, he departed.

369
00:18:33.455 --> 00:18:36.935
That is Jesus departed and went out to a lonely place

370
00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:41.335
and there he prayed and it says Simon

371
00:18:41.435 --> 00:18:42.895
and those who were with him searched

372
00:18:42.895 --> 00:18:44.375
for him and they found him.

373
00:18:45.075 --> 00:18:47.495
So he went to a lonely place alone to pray,

374
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.375
to spend time with the Father.

375
00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:52.855
How do we navigate the times

376
00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:54.935
that we feel like we're in a wilderness?

377
00:18:55.595 --> 00:18:58.175
How can we ensure that our soul needs are met?

378
00:18:58.365 --> 00:19:01.735
Well, David would tell us that we need to cry out to God

379
00:19:02.355 --> 00:19:04.175
in times of personal worship.

380
00:19:04.995 --> 00:19:07.735
We need to focus on God's goodness and power

381
00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:10.935
and might engaging in worship as we go

382
00:19:10.935 --> 00:19:13.455
through the wilderness of life, as we go

383
00:19:13.455 --> 00:19:17.615
through the hardships that we face, we can feel tired,

384
00:19:18.035 --> 00:19:21.255
hungry, and the thirst should remind us

385
00:19:22.045 --> 00:19:24.095
that we need this relationship with God

386
00:19:24.115 --> 00:19:25.375
and it should lead us to worship.

387
00:19:27.685 --> 00:19:32.305
We need to be careful not to purposefully isolate ourselves

388
00:19:32.815 --> 00:19:37.145
from others, but sometimes we may be isolated

389
00:19:38.245 --> 00:19:39.905
and we can worship in those experiences.

390
00:19:41.445 --> 00:19:44.665
We shouldn't neglect the resources that he's lovingly

391
00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:49.225
provided for us, but there may be times that we don't feel

392
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.665
or have those resources around us

393
00:19:53.075 --> 00:19:54.535
and we can worship in those times.

394
00:19:55.755 --> 00:19:59.015
Prayer gives us the avenue to cry out to God,

395
00:19:59.075 --> 00:20:01.335
to express what's deep within us.

396
00:20:01.515 --> 00:20:03.495
And perhaps even song does that as well.

397
00:20:03.955 --> 00:20:06.935
Our burdens can be laid at his feet pleading

398
00:20:06.935 --> 00:20:09.135
for provision songs.

399
00:20:09.315 --> 00:20:12.175
Let us cry in another way, expressing our love

400
00:20:12.635 --> 00:20:13.815
and our faith in God.

401
00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:16.775
God's word feeds our soul with truth

402
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:18.295
and instructs us how to live.

403
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.655
And meditation allows us

404
00:20:20.675 --> 00:20:23.495
to ruminate over the truths that God's given us.

405
00:20:24.735 --> 00:20:26.985
Imagine a cow cooing chewing the cudd.

406
00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:29.145
And you all know that cows have four stomachs, right?

407
00:20:29.685 --> 00:20:30.905
It goes from one to the next,

408
00:20:31.035 --> 00:20:33.585
ruminating getting every particle out.

409
00:20:33.585 --> 00:20:36.385
And that's what meditation is supposed to be for us.

410
00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:40.105
Ruminating over, pulling out the truths

411
00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:42.425
and allowing God to give us ways of application.

412
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.705
We have other resources that David didn't have.

413
00:20:45.925 --> 00:20:47.025
We have community groups.

414
00:20:47.985 --> 00:20:51.845
We have Celebrate Recovery, which is a ministry associated

415
00:20:51.845 --> 00:20:52.885
with ministries of Jesus.

416
00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:56.605
We have grief share. We have discipleship groups.

417
00:20:57.585 --> 00:21:01.245
We have many ways that we can lean into resources

418
00:21:01.245 --> 00:21:02.245
that God has given us.

419
00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:05.925
So we have to use all these resources as we traverse

420
00:21:05.925 --> 00:21:09.965
through our wilderness worship God as we go

421
00:21:09.965 --> 00:21:13.285
through the wilderness, not just when we're in

422
00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:16.315
a comfortable place.

423
00:21:17.895 --> 00:21:19.595
And this brings us to the third truth

424
00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.195
that this Psalm displays for us

425
00:21:21.415 --> 00:21:24.035
and this illustrated in verses four through eight.

426
00:21:25.295 --> 00:21:28.475
We can trust God to resolve life's hardships.

427
00:21:29.575 --> 00:21:32.275
He will see us through the wilderness.

428
00:21:32.935 --> 00:21:35.275
We can trust that he will feed the hungry soul

429
00:21:35.615 --> 00:21:38.675
and will he'll, he'll give water to the soul who thirsts.

430
00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:41.715
David didn't know exactly how it was gonna end.

431
00:21:41.855 --> 00:21:44.315
He was on the run, people were chasing him.

432
00:21:44.665 --> 00:21:48.355
He's in the middle of hunger and need, but he trusted God

433
00:21:48.415 --> 00:21:52.155
and he says in verse four, so I will bless you

434
00:21:52.415 --> 00:21:53.555
as long as I live.

435
00:21:54.945 --> 00:21:57.395
David's saying again in the same way

436
00:21:57.655 --> 00:22:00.995
or in the same manner going forward as I go

437
00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:03.435
through this hardship, I'm going to bless you.

438
00:22:04.015 --> 00:22:05.315
I'm going to worship you.

439
00:22:06.395 --> 00:22:08.435
I can trust that you're going to resolve this.

440
00:22:09.065 --> 00:22:10.955
He's saying, I'm in need now.

441
00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:12.315
I'm suffering now,

442
00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:15.035
but I can trust that you're going to resolve it,

443
00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:16.435
that you're going to see me through.

444
00:22:18.635 --> 00:22:21.915
I know that again, my personal tendency is

445
00:22:22.135 --> 00:22:26.315
to focus on the hardship, maybe to complain, uh, maybe

446
00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:27.755
to think about the circumstances

447
00:22:27.895 --> 00:22:29.395
and look for areas of failure.

448
00:22:29.935 --> 00:22:32.835
But this psalm in this Psalm, David reminds me

449
00:22:32.905 --> 00:22:34.315
that I need to do the opposite.

450
00:22:34.715 --> 00:22:37.395
I need to focus my attention on God's goodness and power

451
00:22:38.015 --> 00:22:40.915
and be reminded of God's glory

452
00:22:41.065 --> 00:22:45.875
because this is how he will see me through this kind

453
00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:48.915
of trust is illustrated in the New Testament for us.

454
00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:51.875
Also, do you remember the story shortly

455
00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:55.195
after Jesus had left the earth after his death

456
00:22:55.195 --> 00:22:56.435
and burial and resurrection?

457
00:22:57.205 --> 00:22:58.555
Peter was arrested

458
00:22:59.095 --> 00:23:03.475
and it says that Peter was in chains asleep

459
00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:05.235
between two guards.

460
00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:09.555
Imagine that he, he was surely facing persecution,

461
00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:10.675
maybe death the next day.

462
00:23:10.675 --> 00:23:14.195
And it says that Peter was asleep and God rescued him.

463
00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:17.395
Or we have the picture of Paul and Silas.

464
00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:21.035
They were arrested in Philippi and they were beaten

465
00:23:21.135 --> 00:23:23.875
and put in chains and they were with the jailer.

466
00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:26.195
It says, and what were they doing?

467
00:23:26.225 --> 00:23:28.595
They were singing God's praises in the midst

468
00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:29.675
of their hard time.

469
00:23:30.855 --> 00:23:33.915
Why? Because they knew that God was at work even

470
00:23:33.915 --> 00:23:35.035
through their hard time

471
00:23:35.255 --> 00:23:37.675
and that God would be the one who delivered them.

472
00:23:39.045 --> 00:23:41.635
David says, because I see your power

473
00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:44.995
and might displayed in the sanctuary, I will bless you

474
00:23:45.745 --> 00:23:48.725
in all circumstances at all times.

475
00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:53.515
He's filling his mind with all the goodness of God so

476
00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:56.115
that he doesn't focus on the very real suffering

477
00:23:56.225 --> 00:23:57.875
that he was experiencing at the time.

478
00:23:59.535 --> 00:24:02.555
One of my favorite passages is, is in Philippians four,

479
00:24:03.215 --> 00:24:06.555
and I'll just look at verse eight, finally, brothers

480
00:24:07.255 --> 00:24:11.635
and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable,

481
00:24:12.155 --> 00:24:14.955
whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,

482
00:24:15.835 --> 00:24:18.355
whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence,

483
00:24:18.355 --> 00:24:19.795
if there is anything worthy of praise,

484
00:24:20.285 --> 00:24:21.635
think about these things.

485
00:24:22.975 --> 00:24:24.995
We tend to be shaped by the things

486
00:24:24.995 --> 00:24:26.675
that we focus our attention on.

487
00:24:27.455 --> 00:24:30.075
And Paul reminds us here to focus on things

488
00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:31.395
that are wonderful and good

489
00:24:31.395 --> 00:24:35.515
and true so that we can trust

490
00:24:36.045 --> 00:24:37.395
God's deliverance and purpose.

491
00:24:38.295 --> 00:24:39.315
The result of this type

492
00:24:39.315 --> 00:24:42.155
of worship is seen in verse five of the Psalm.

493
00:24:42.935 --> 00:24:46.515
My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,

494
00:24:46.895 --> 00:24:49.675
and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.

495
00:24:50.175 --> 00:24:54.395
The word satisfied here means to eat one's fill

496
00:24:54.735 --> 00:24:56.675
or to drink to one's fill.

497
00:24:56.975 --> 00:24:58.795
And I'm pretty sure that most of you got a chance

498
00:24:58.795 --> 00:25:00.435
to do this about two days ago

499
00:25:00.435 --> 00:25:03.715
or three days ago, you ate your favorite foods.

500
00:25:04.335 --> 00:25:07.635
You can remember even now, maybe the textures and the tastes

501
00:25:07.975 --> 00:25:11.355
and the way that it felt to be with company of people

502
00:25:11.355 --> 00:25:13.675
that love you and want to be with you.

503
00:25:14.455 --> 00:25:17.555
And you were satisfied if you didn't eat too much,

504
00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:21.835
you felt comfort and you felt sustained.

505
00:25:22.175 --> 00:25:25.075
And that's the picture that David has for us here.

506
00:25:26.225 --> 00:25:28.515
He's reminding us through the metaphor of food

507
00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:32.915
that we can have that same kind of comfort as we look

508
00:25:32.915 --> 00:25:36.235
to the goodness of God and trust God as we go

509
00:25:36.395 --> 00:25:38.035
through our wilderness experience.

510
00:25:39.775 --> 00:25:44.115
The innermost part of our beings can be satisfied as we look

511
00:25:44.115 --> 00:25:47.075
to God to meet our needs and to satisfy our longings.

512
00:25:47.685 --> 00:25:50.915
Verse seven describes the safety that comes

513
00:25:50.915 --> 00:25:52.395
to the soul who trusts in God.

514
00:25:53.935 --> 00:25:55.195
For you have been my help.

515
00:25:55.535 --> 00:25:58.155
And in the shadow of your wings, I will sing for joy.

516
00:25:59.025 --> 00:26:01.035
This is the protective covering that's

517
00:26:01.035 --> 00:26:02.875
so frequently mentioned throughout scripture,

518
00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:05.475
both in the Old Testament and the New Testament.

519
00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:09.315
We see pictures of a bird, a hen in some places

520
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.395
covering the young with protection.

521
00:26:12.775 --> 00:26:16.275
And we see this picture used in Ruth chapters two

522
00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:18.995
and three where Ruth came under the protective

523
00:26:19.275 --> 00:26:20.355
covering of Boaz.

524
00:26:20.895 --> 00:26:24.075
We see it mentioned through several of the Psalms

525
00:26:24.295 --> 00:26:25.715
and then we see it also mentioned

526
00:26:25.715 --> 00:26:28.075
by Jesus himself in the New Testament.

527
00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:30.555
Matthew 23,

528
00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:35.395
Jesus is crying out over Jerusalem when he says Jerusalem.

529
00:26:35.465 --> 00:26:37.795
Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets

530
00:26:37.795 --> 00:26:39.675
and stones, those who are sent to it.

531
00:26:40.415 --> 00:26:43.725
How often would I have gathered your children together

532
00:26:43.825 --> 00:26:47.005
as a hen gathers her brooded under her wings?

533
00:26:48.105 --> 00:26:50.605
We see this picture of a protective covering

534
00:26:50.825 --> 00:26:52.605
and that's what David is referring to.

535
00:26:53.265 --> 00:26:54.645
You might ask, how do I know

536
00:26:54.645 --> 00:26:56.325
that I'm under God's protection?

537
00:26:56.585 --> 00:26:59.085
How do I know in the midst of my hardship when I can't

538
00:26:59.615 --> 00:27:01.685
understand what my health is gonna do,

539
00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:04.885
when I can't pay my bills or a loved one is suffering?

540
00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:09.005
We need to remember God's countenance towards

541
00:27:09.015 --> 00:27:10.485
those whom he's called.

542
00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:16.045
Remember his steadfast love, his powerful presence.

543
00:27:17.025 --> 00:27:20.085
He will oversee us with his mighty power.

544
00:27:20.865 --> 00:27:24.485
He will work for a purpose through what we're going through.

545
00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:28.325
So in the mis, in the middle of our desert experience

546
00:27:28.585 --> 00:27:30.765
or David's desert experience, he's reminded

547
00:27:31.185 --> 00:27:32.605
of all the goodness of God

548
00:27:32.945 --> 00:27:35.245
and that God's wings are protecting him.

549
00:27:37.215 --> 00:27:40.205
Verse eight tells us that David is clinging to God,

550
00:27:40.745 --> 00:27:44.485
but more importantly, God is holding him.

551
00:27:45.785 --> 00:27:50.405
It says, my soul clings to you. Your right hand upholds me.

552
00:27:51.665 --> 00:27:54.605
And as followers of Christ, we should be clinging

553
00:27:54.605 --> 00:27:56.285
to the truth that he's shown us.

554
00:27:56.945 --> 00:27:58.125
But we need to remember

555
00:27:58.125 --> 00:28:00.605
that our security is not in our holding,

556
00:28:01.185 --> 00:28:04.365
but it's in God's sustaining hold on us.

557
00:28:05.065 --> 00:28:07.245
God holds us with his hands.

558
00:28:08.625 --> 00:28:10.125
Romans eight is one

559
00:28:10.125 --> 00:28:11.885
of the most powerful declarations of this.

560
00:28:11.885 --> 00:28:13.485
And I'm gonna read the whole passage here.

561
00:28:13.585 --> 00:28:16.565
Romans 8 35 through 38,

562
00:28:18.025 --> 00:28:20.205
who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

563
00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:24.445
Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine

564
00:28:24.445 --> 00:28:26.685
or nakedness or danger or sword?

565
00:28:27.465 --> 00:28:30.685
No. In all these things we're more than conquerors

566
00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:31.965
through him who loved us.

567
00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:36.565
For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels

568
00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:39.525
nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come,

569
00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:41.805
nor powers nor height, nor depth

570
00:28:41.945 --> 00:28:45.605
nor anything else in all creation, will be able

571
00:28:45.605 --> 00:28:47.405
to separate us from the love

572
00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:49.245
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

573
00:28:49.955 --> 00:28:51.805
What a list of hardships.

574
00:28:52.275 --> 00:28:53.325
Paul mentions here,

575
00:28:53.385 --> 00:28:56.845
or the writer of Romans mentions here what a list of things

576
00:28:56.875 --> 00:29:00.165
that we might think could separate us from God's love.

577
00:29:00.465 --> 00:29:04.365
But he assures us, no, none of these things can separate us.

578
00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:07.485
God is true and God is faithful

579
00:29:07.485 --> 00:29:10.285
and he has a has said love for us.

580
00:29:11.835 --> 00:29:13.645
This is the truth we have to clinging to.

581
00:29:15.635 --> 00:29:17.895
And this brings us to the last point I'd like

582
00:29:17.895 --> 00:29:19.255
to emphasize from this psalm.

583
00:29:20.235 --> 00:29:22.415
We can rejoice in God's goodness now

584
00:29:22.835 --> 00:29:25.655
and we can look forward to God's goodness in the future.

585
00:29:27.275 --> 00:29:31.295
Verses nine through 11, describe some really graphic

586
00:29:31.935 --> 00:29:35.655
outcomes for victims of war at that time.

587
00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:40.005
For David, his son's chasing him

588
00:29:40.705 --> 00:29:42.045
and forcing him into the desert.

589
00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:45.445
For some of us, it's other things.

590
00:29:45.895 --> 00:29:48.245
Maybe it's some powerful person

591
00:29:48.385 --> 00:29:51.165
or power you think that's trying to destroy your life.

592
00:29:52.265 --> 00:29:54.965
Is there someone that continually robs you of joy?

593
00:29:56.025 --> 00:29:59.565
Is there someone opposing you because you're a child of God?

594
00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:02.805
Is there a deep hurt you're carrying around?

595
00:30:03.665 --> 00:30:05.805
Is there a harmful habit you've picked up

596
00:30:05.805 --> 00:30:07.165
that's damaging your peace?

597
00:30:07.635 --> 00:30:10.285
There's so many ways that our soul can be attacked,

598
00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:11.925
leaving us dry and barren,

599
00:30:12.265 --> 00:30:14.165
and we can feel like we're gonna be overtaken.

600
00:30:14.395 --> 00:30:17.445
Just like David feeling like he could be overtaken

601
00:30:17.445 --> 00:30:21.485
by his enemies, it reveals our desperate need

602
00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:24.245
for God's work in our life, for his saving work.

603
00:30:24.745 --> 00:30:27.005
And as a child of God, we have to remember

604
00:30:27.115 --> 00:30:28.565
that he has us in his palm,

605
00:30:28.955 --> 00:30:31.165
that his steadfast love is caring for us

606
00:30:31.545 --> 00:30:33.325
and that he will see us through.

607
00:30:34.105 --> 00:30:36.565
And this is the language that David is using here.

608
00:30:37.475 --> 00:30:41.885
It's it's a a truth that we need to clinging to that God

609
00:30:42.475 --> 00:30:44.845
will see us through that.

610
00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:48.085
He will carry us through the hardship. Okay?

611
00:30:49.225 --> 00:30:52.525
We might face hard times. We won't always be prosperous.

612
00:30:52.545 --> 00:30:55.405
We will have to suffer, but he will see us through,

613
00:30:55.985 --> 00:30:58.245
and that's what I'm saying, that we can deal with God.

614
00:30:58.745 --> 00:31:00.845
We can trust God to deal with us faithfully.

615
00:31:02.385 --> 00:31:05.605
Two Corinthians four paints a beautiful picture of this

616
00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:08.285
for us because it illustrates how fragile we are

617
00:31:08.905 --> 00:31:12.285
and yet how faithful God is, verse seven.

618
00:31:12.905 --> 00:31:15.525
But if we have this treasure in jars of clay,

619
00:31:16.735 --> 00:31:19.105
that we have this treasure in jars of clay to show

620
00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:22.385
that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.

621
00:31:23.045 --> 00:31:26.345
We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed,

622
00:31:26.345 --> 00:31:29.705
but not given to despair, persecuted but not forsaken.

623
00:31:30.285 --> 00:31:34.545
Struck down, but not destroyed, always carrying in the body,

624
00:31:34.645 --> 00:31:37.065
the death of Jesus so that the life

625
00:31:37.065 --> 00:31:41.665
of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies, for we

626
00:31:41.725 --> 00:31:43.945
who live are always being given over to death

627
00:31:44.005 --> 00:31:45.545
for Jesus' sake, so that the life

628
00:31:45.545 --> 00:31:48.345
of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh

629
00:31:48.965 --> 00:31:50.225
as followers of Christ.

630
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:52.785
We have resources that David didn't have.

631
00:31:53.315 --> 00:31:57.345
David didn't have the continual presence of the Holy Spirit.

632
00:31:57.795 --> 00:32:01.705
David didn't have the published word of God to look at day

633
00:32:01.725 --> 00:32:02.945
by day that we have.

634
00:32:03.155 --> 00:32:05.425
David didn't have the church fellowship that we have.

635
00:32:07.765 --> 00:32:11.465
We have resources that David looked forward to

636
00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:13.585
as he looked forward to the coming of the Messiah.

637
00:32:14.445 --> 00:32:16.265
So Christian brother or sister,

638
00:32:16.645 --> 00:32:20.065
if you're in a wilderness experience now, take advantage

639
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:22.345
of all the resources that God has given you.

640
00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:24.745
Remember his steadfast love.

641
00:32:25.785 --> 00:32:28.545
Remember his faithful, powerful presence.

642
00:32:29.315 --> 00:32:31.665
Don't forsake the community of fellowship,

643
00:32:31.885 --> 00:32:34.185
but figure out how to worship God as you go

644
00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:37.865
through the wilderness and then trust the promises

645
00:32:37.865 --> 00:32:39.945
that God has given you that you can look forward

646
00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:41.945
to God delivering you through.

647
00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:44.425
If there's anyone here who has.
