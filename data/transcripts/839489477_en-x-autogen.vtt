00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.150
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.790
I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.590
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.950
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.230
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.110
Well, good morning, church family.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.190
My name is Jimmy Quinn and I'm on staff here as our connections pastor. And so,

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.710
like Scott said, if you're new here, welcome. Uh, so glad you're here,

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.230
love to meet you after the service, uh, I'll kind of probably be in this area,

10
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.670
so come by and say hi. Or if you want,

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.910
you can go out those doors into the construction zone. Big sign.

12
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.070
Amy is out there. She'd love to meet you too. But, uh, as we get started,

13
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.310
I wanna tell you guys a story. Now, this story's a little bit graphic, uh,

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.990
but it's PG graphic. And so, uh,

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.750
I'm gonna use some strategic words as I share today,

16
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.070
but there were two men who were visiting a small city in the Middle East.

17
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.950
And when they arrived, uh, they were welcomed into the house of another man.

18
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.990
And word got around that, uh, these guests were there. And so the people,

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.800
all of them,

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.630
young and old of the town rallied together to ambush these

21
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.790
visitors. The story goes on that the men circled the house,

22
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.830
the men circled the house and demanded that they get to know these

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.870
men and have relations with them.

24
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.830
So my wife and I had the privilege of going to Israel a couple weeks back,

25
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.910
and we were near the city or the cities where this happened.

26
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.390
Those cities are Sodom and Gomorrah.

27
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.870
And you can read more about this story in Genesis 18 and 19,

28
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.070
but how does that story end? Well,

29
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.990
God spared the homeowner and the visitors and the family from these wicked

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.590
men, but then he rained down fire and sulfur,

31
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.750
and these two cities have never been rebuilt again,

32
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.270
and they won't be rebuilt again because of God's justice towards the wicked.

33
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.270
So we'll be in Psalm 58 today as we continue this summer going

34
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.190
chapter by chapter for different psalms.

35
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.710
And so if you were here the last two weeks, you've heard, um,

36
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.390
from Phil and Brandon, um, who did a great job.

37
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.790
And in the next two weeks you'll hear from our boy Brent McCoy and

38
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.750
Ryan Whitaker, who's one of my favorites in these five psalms.

39
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.030
The last two, this one, and these next two are all similar.

40
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.390
They're all connected in some way. Um, but Psalm 58 is a little bit different.

41
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.190
It's an imprecatory psalm.

42
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.270
Now an imprecatory psalm is one in which the author calls down,

43
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.430
uh, destruction a curse or judgment onto his enemies.

44
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.070
And so, um, they're not uncontrolled outbursts or angers of, uh,

45
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.510
of expression or personal vengeance like they may seem.

46
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.060
And so our author of our psalm today is David,

47
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.500
and he's calling out to God because the injustices of corrupt leaders around

48
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.000
him,

49
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.860
he describes him as wicked a term given to people who don't fear honor

50
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.060
or obey God.

51
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.940
So today we'll talk about corrupt leaders and as I read this psalm a couple

52
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.900
weeks month back, I was like, oh boy, what are they setting me up for here?

53
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.820
You know, this seems like a slippery slope given our climate,

54
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.780
but the more that I've studied, uh, got help from, uh,

55
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.820
our community group discussion guide and friends, and, uh,

56
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.420
there's a book Christ-Centered Ex uh, exposition that's really been helpful.

57
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.260
The more I believe, uh,

58
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.140
the David's central point that he's trying to get us to understand is that

59
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.740
true believers of the gospel ought to be enraged at injustices

60
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.780
driving us to our needs and prayer,

61
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.260
true believers of the gospel ought to be enraged at injustices driving us

62
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.660
to our knees in prayer. So before we read the text in Psalm 58,

63
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.700
lemme pray for us, God,

64
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.220
as we open up your word to us.

65
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.100
I I pray for the, the hearers of your word that they, they hear from you,

66
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.140
not from me. Um, they see your justice,

67
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.700
but they also see your mercy and your love and your forgiveness and your grace.

68
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.340
Uh, be with us today as we, um, uh, study your word. It's in your name we pray.

69
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.780
Amen. Psalm 58

70
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.740
says this. It says, do you

71
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.460
decree what is right? Oh God's,

72
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.740
do you judge the children of man uprightly? No.

73
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.940
In your hearts, you devise wrongs in your hands,

74
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.860
deal out violence on the earth. The wicked are estranged from the womb.

75
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.140
They go astray from birth speaking lies.

76
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.740
They have venom like the venom of a serpent,

77
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.180
like the death adder that stops its ears.

78
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.300
So it does not hear the voice of charmers or cunning enchanter,

79
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.220
oh God, break the teeth in their mouth,

80
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.100
tear out their fangs of young lions. Oh Lord,

81
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.700
let them vanish like water that runs away when he aims his arrows.

82
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.700
Let them be blunted.

83
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.460
Let them be like the snail that's dissolved in slime like the stillborn child

84
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.420
who never sees the sun sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns,

85
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.180
whether green or lays. May he be swept away.

86
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.500
The righteous will rejoice when he sees vengeance.

87
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.460
He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked and mankind will say,

88
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.860
surely there is a reward for righteousness.

89
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.060
Surely there is a God who judges the earth in all God's people said,

90
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.020
amen. Right. What a fun passage.

91
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.980
So we get to talk about venom of snakes and,

92
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.780
and snake charmers and fangs of lions.

93
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.660
We get to talk about slime kids. How do we feel about slime

94
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.940
parents? How do you feel about slime? Yeah,

95
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.060
I'm with you. Um, and then we gotta talk about bathing in blood. And so,

96
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.900
um, you guys wanna walk through this text and see what it means. Let's do it.

97
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.733
Let's begin.

98
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.260
So we don't really know what's for what's going on in David's life for certain,

99
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.820
but based off the similarities of these five psalms together,

100
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.940
we could assume that David is writing this song as a result of King

101
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.460
Saul. Saul was the king at the time, and he was chasing after David,

102
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.860
uh, because he was angry and feared, uh, he was a threat to his throne.

103
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.860
So presumably David is calling out to God about the injustices of Saul.

104
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.020
And so the structure of our psalm today,

105
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.780
Psalm 50 eight's really gonna help with us, uh,

106
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.940
with our main points and our three subpoints,

107
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.860
which the main point is true. Believers of the gospel ought to be enraged.

108
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.420
Injustices driving us to our knees and prayer, it should frustrate us.

109
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.340
And then our first point that we see in verses one through five is that David

110
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.180
rebukes the wicked David rebukes the wicked.

111
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.820
So he starts off with a question which he quickly answers. Now,

112
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.100
I love my wife and she doesn't do this. Um,

113
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.420
and and maybe your wives or husbands don't do this either way,

114
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.060
but imagine your spouse saying, honey, did you take out the trash?

115
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.460
And before you could even answer, um, he or she responded back, no you didn't.

116
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.260
Well, that's kind of what's happening here.

117
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.780
David asked the question and he responds, infa in emphatically no,

118
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.460
in your heart you devise wrong.

119
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.260
What he's saying here is that it's a premeditated evil that it was planned out.

120
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.340
He then goes on to say that the wicked are estranged from the womb.

121
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.900
I wanna pause here and I wanna expound a little bit about what that could mean.

122
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.660
How can a person go astray from birth?

123
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.820
David in Psalm 51 recognizes this of himself when he says that he was born

124
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.740
with sin. Now,

125
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.020
the Bible clearly teaches that children are sinners.

126
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.860
Can I get an amen from a mom of a three year old? Right?

127
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.860
We are not born innocent, only later to become sinners.

128
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.980
Being sinful from birth means that our hearts are inclined towards sin

129
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.180
prior to any actual sins happening.

130
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.700
This inner sinfulness is the root in this source of all actual sins.

131
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.620
So to get technical, this is called depravity. And anytime I hear depravity,

132
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.140
I go back to Genesis chapter five, verse three.

133
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.940
So follow with me here in Genesis chapter one and two,

134
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.660
God created the heavens and the earth, right?

135
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.540
And he created man and woman and he created Adam in his own

136
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.580
likeness, right? Well, in Genesis five, verse three,

137
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.860
which is after Adam and Eve were removed,

138
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.540
removed from the presence of God in the garden, because they're a sin,

139
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.660
we see that Adam fathered a son in his likeness.

140
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.020
And so what's his likeness? Well, his likeness is of a sinful man.

141
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.380
So that kind of sounds like a bummer of a deal for us, right?

142
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.540
That before we have a chance to not sin,

143
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.860
we are already inclined to sin.

144
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.860
But I think this is where we see the beauty of the gospel through one man's

145
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.900
sin enter the world, but through another man, the second Adam, we see Christ.

146
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.740
Romans chapter five, verses 12 through 21 really explains this well.

147
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.780
And so I wanna read part of it. It's kind of a lot.

148
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.660
Paul does a great job of explaining it. It goes into a lot of detail.

149
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.140
But I wanna read verse 12 and then skip down to verse 17. It says this,

150
00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:00.620
therefore, just as sin came in through the world, through one man and death,

151
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.300
through sin, so death spread to all men, because all sin, verse 17,

152
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.940
for if because of one man's trespasses, death reign through that one man,

153
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.740
much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of

154
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.660
righteousness reign in life through one man Jesus Christ. Therefore,

155
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.820
as one trespass led to the condemnation for all men.

156
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.860
So one act of righteousness leads to the justification and life for all men.

157
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.100
For as by one man's disobedience, the many were made sinners.

158
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.460
So by one man's obedience, the many were made righteous.

159
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.340
Now the law came to increase the trespass,

160
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.420
but where sin increased grace abounded all the more so that as

161
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.420
death as sin reigned in death,

162
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.260
grace also might reign through the righteousness leading to eternal life through

163
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.540
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Do you guys see the beauty in that?

164
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.940
Because of our sin through Adam, we were prescribed death.

165
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.540
And because of our sin, because of your sin, and because of my sin,

166
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.060
we were separated from God. But then Romans tells us, but God,

167
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.540
through his amazing grace, we can have eternal life, not eternal death.

168
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.020
So Jesus reversed the sin, reversed the curse of sin,

169
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.100
reversed the death so that we can receive this free gift of life.

170
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.780
All hell king Jesus, right? Praise God for king Jesus.

171
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.340
So back to Psalm 58, David, uh, talking about their depravity,

172
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.220
then he compares the effectiveness of these wicked abusers to the venom of

173
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.353
snakes.

174
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.140
These influencers were poisoning those entrusted to their care

175
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.180
and it makes David angry. Now, this is where it gets tricky.

176
00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.190
Friends, I think the psalm is telling us that when we see injustices,

177
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.870
it should make us angry. For example,

178
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.230
think of a child being abused,

179
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.870
that should make you angry.

180
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.110
Or maybe as someone with special needs being bullied,

181
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.100
that should make us angry.

182
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.140
Or a senior adult being conned and then neglected,

183
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.100
or kids being exposed to all sorts of evil before they even uh,

184
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.020
should be exposed to things like that.

185
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.700
Things like this and many others should make us angry Christian.

186
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.660
And then in verse five,

187
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.220
we see the wording about charmers and cunning enchanters.

188
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.100
That means that these wicked people are just turning a deaf ear to any sort of

189
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.580
logic or voice of reason or persuasion.

190
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.540
They don't care to listen.

191
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.380
So what do we do with verses like this? Well,

192
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.780
I think we have an obligation to advocate for the relief of those who are

193
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.780
victims of oppression.

194
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.820
But with that obligation and must be seasoned with salt,

195
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.060
we must always advocate through the lens of the gospel and with the character of

196
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.940
Christ. You'll miss the point of today if you hear me promote any kind of, uh,

197
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.300
of an upheaval. And before we rush off to start, uh,

198
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.620
throwing stones and casting out people's abuse,

199
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.420
we must first remember our sin and the incredible gift of God's mercy for us.

200
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.380
So our first point in Psalm 58, verses one through five,

201
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.540
we see that David rebukes the wicked and our second point in the text

202
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.580
verses six through nine, where I think it gets fun, uh,

203
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.060
real fun part of the text we see David requesting for justice,

204
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.140
David requests for justice. So let me ask you a rhetorical question.

205
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.060
If true believers of Jesus are to oppose,

206
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.660
be frustrated by and enraged at justice at injustices like we just saw,

207
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.500
how much good can you do on your own to stifle these wicked

208
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.220
people in the world? Honestly, you can probably drum up, uh,

209
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.420
some, some helpers and strive to make a dent through activism and protests,

210
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.500
which I'm not saying is wrong at all. But what did David do?

211
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.460
What was his response to these justices?

212
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.660
I'd like to offer a more effective strategy than activism and protest.

213
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.420
And that's prayer.

214
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.580
David calls out to God and he does so by using several

215
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.860
metaphors. So he says, God, would you break their?

216
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.660
And so we're just gonna walk through these. They're kind of fun. So,

217
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.820
so God would you break their teeth and tear out their fangs?

218
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.500
So David is asking that these evil people keep from communicating.

219
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.180
And it's important to note here that David doesn't think these wicked

220
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.180
influencers are are cool little cats and kittens,

221
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.060
but rather wild and untamed beasts.

222
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.740
He's asking for a dentist.

223
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.140
Then David request that they be like an evaporating water here today

224
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.540
and gone tomorrow. The third metaphor that their arrows be blunted.

225
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.820
David is essentially asking for his enemies to have Nerf guns.

226
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.060
Who wants to have a Nerf gun war? That sounds kind of fun.

227
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.380
And then my fourth or the fourth analogy metaphor that we see,

228
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.220
uh, is that of a, a snail dissolved in slime.

229
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.980
Some of your versions may say slug.

230
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.420
Has anyone ever poured salt on a slug or a slime?

231
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.900
Okay, good. I was like, surely somebody has. I'm not the only one. Well,

232
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.580
what happens to that? Well, they dissolve,

233
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.900
they turn gooey and dead. And so, uh, it's kind of fun.

234
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.660
You should try it sometime. But then next,

235
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.860
the fifth thing is that God not even let evil people be born.

236
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.100
He's asking that their eyes never see the sun.

237
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.700
And then the final request, he uses a campfire analogy.

238
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.380
So imagine you're going camping and, and you catch some food.

239
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.900
Maybe you catch some fish for a fish fry, or maybe you catch a chicken. I,

240
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.580
I don't know what you catch, but imagine putting it a pot of water and,

241
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.100
and you go to cook it and you get the,

242
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.700
the sticks all kindled and, and it's gonna be a good fish fry.

243
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.140
And then some of our Oklahoma 80 mile an hour winds come sweeping down the plane

244
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.940
and it puts out your fire.

245
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.380
And so now you're left with sushi or uncooked chicken.

246
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.980
Neither one are very good, but what David is asking for

247
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.100
is that God render them useless and do so quickly.

248
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.420
So to summarize these six curses that David is asking God for about the wicked

249
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.140
is that they be mute, evaporated, pointless, dissolved,

250
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.700
not even born and useless. That's what David's asking for.

251
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.820
Should believers pray like this?

252
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.060
The psalmist appears driven by outrage that these leaders exist at all.

253
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.140
His desire for their end seems violent.

254
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.820
One theologian says it this way about praying such violent prayers. He says,

255
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.340
it prompts us to question whether an impassioned curse of tyrants is better

256
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.380
or worse than a shrug of shoulders or diplomatic silence.

257
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.860
He's saying that passivity is worse.

258
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.540
The same theologian shares the idea that when Jesus seemed to opt for this

259
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.820
bolder approach in the New Testament, in Matthew 23, he lists out a,

260
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.980
a series of curses to the scribes and Pharisees, when he says, woe to you,

261
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.980
you scribes, you, Pharisees, you hypocrites.

262
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.340
So these lead in are followed by some of Jesus's most strongest and most damning

263
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.700
words in all the New Testament. And while none of us are Jesus,

264
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.220
and while our engagement with bad people must be intended to overcome evil with

265
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:05.640
good,

266
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.380
our Lord did seem to affirm this practice that the psalmist is crying out for,

267
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.540
that God would bring an end to malicious leaders.

268
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.440
That's what we see. So David requests for justice.

269
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.400
And then in the final verse,

270
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.200
we see David rejoicing David rejoices for righteousness.

271
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.600
And why? Because he knows how the story ends.

272
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.720
So imagine David singing the song, I know how the story ends,

273
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.520
and when he gets to this part of the psalm, he's like, yeah,

274
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.320
and we're about to sing that song here in a minute and Lindsay's gonna lead us

275
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.760
through that. But David knows how the story ends.

276
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.080
He knows that God will respond to the prayers of a ch of his children when we

277
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.520
cry out to him. God doesn't change.

278
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.400
He has always been a just God and he will always be a just God.

279
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.800
He's been clear about that all along. And the prophet Isaiah says in chapter 24,

280
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.633
verse 21,

281
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.680
that there will be a day when God will impose his full and complete judgment on

282
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.040
the wicked. And at that time, those who are in Christ will celebrate justice.

283
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.560
David knows how the story ends.

284
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:24.040
Verse 10 and 11, the righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance.

285
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.040
He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked verse ten's kind of

286
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.040
confusing, why will the righteous bathe in blood?

287
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:38.200
Sounds kind of grotesque and maybe I could be convinced

288
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.720
that there's some benefits to this mud bath that some of you guys partake in,

289
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.960
you know, exfoliating things and sheen and all that kinda stuff.

290
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.000
But a mud bath seems a little different to me. And so it's kind of a,

291
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.880
a yucky expression in my opinion. But the one theologian says it this way,

292
00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.600
this is an expression of a traditional near Eastern way of

293
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.960
describing the utter defeat of an enemy.

294
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.880
So we're not looking at some twisted grim foot washing ceremony, but as victors,

295
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.080
they weighed through the blood leftover from the carnage of battle.

296
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.600
So you may have heard the analogy bloodbath in maybe a sporting

297
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.640
event. Uh, big time sporting events,

298
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.760
important sporting events like King of the Beach. Uh,

299
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.920
for those of you that don't know,

300
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.120
our church is about to have a king of the beach volleyball tournament beginning

301
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.043
today.

302
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.400
And I just wanna warn my opponents that they may be in for a blood bath because

303
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.760
I'm feeling pretty good today. Anyway, back to the text.

304
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.040
Um, this blood bath sounds morbid and gruesome,

305
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.900
and we may be attempted to shy away from this, or at least I am,

306
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.860
but it makes complete sense in light of a larger,

307
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.660
the larger biblical picture of God's righteousness.

308
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.780
He wants us to anticipate a day when he will make right all things that are

309
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.613
wrong in this world.

310
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.820
And if you wanna know more about how this final battle will look like,

311
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.820
or some of the scenes flip to Revelation 14 or 19,

312
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.660
Isaiah 63, and the scene here in Psalm 58 will seem,

313
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:20.660
will kind of pale in comparison to those. Verse 11,

314
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.860
mankind will say, surely there is a reward for righteousness.

315
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.380
Surely there is a God who judges the earth. What is this reward?

316
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.780
What is it? What's our reward for righteousness? Well,

317
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.500
according to Deuteronomy 28,

318
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.700
our reward is that we'll be blessed and it lists a bunch of ways that we'll be

319
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.400
blessed.

320
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.260
But also verse 11 indicates that people will not be left to

321
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.020
the decisions of unjust judges forever.

322
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.873
One day friends,

323
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.900
one day Christ is gonna come back and he will make all things

324
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.500
wrong, all things right that are wrong in our world.

325
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.340
And if you're frustrated with the world, well,

326
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.460
let me give you a sneak peek.

327
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.860
It's gonna get worse until Christ comes back.

328
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.020
But one day Jesus is gonna come back and he's gonna make right

329
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.660
all things that are wrong. I'm encouraged by Philippians two,

330
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.940
verse five through 11, when Paul's writing, he says,

331
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.420
have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.

332
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.460
Who though was in the form of God,

333
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.540
did not count equality with God a thing to be grasp.

334
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.740
But he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant,

335
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:37.020
being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form.

336
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.380
He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death,

337
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.340
even death on the cross. Therefore,

338
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.220
God has highly exalted him and bestowed upon him the name that is above every

339
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.220
name, so that at the name of Jesus,

340
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.220
every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.

341
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.380
And every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God

342
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.460
the Father. So I read this passage for a couple reasons. One,

343
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.780
every knee will bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.

344
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.580
And every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.

345
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.260
Every person who has ever lived, every principality,

346
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:16.140
every person who has influence will know that Jesus Christ is Lord forever.

347
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.660
And they will have to make an accountability to our king for their decisions.

348
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:23.540
Justice will be here soon.

349
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.140
But the second reason I read this passage is not only because we see victory

350
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.700
over these wicked people, but we see Christ,

351
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.660
we can be quick to move past verse 11 and miss something really big.

352
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.380
So I was trying to think of, of a good example of people who have been, uh,

353
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.620
abused or, or oppressed or mistreated.

354
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.180
And you guys can probably guess where I'm going. But Jesus, our king,

355
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.140
our Lord, he was oppressed, he was beaten,

356
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.540
he was spat on. He had a spear in his side.

357
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.060
His hands were nailed to across his feet were nailed to across.

358
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.820
There was a crown of thorns on his head.

359
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.620
He's king of kings, lord of lords.

360
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.620
And Paul tells us in Philippians that he took on the form of a servant.

361
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.700
The main point that of our texts today is true believers ought to be enraged at

362
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.520
injustices.

363
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.980
And the worst injustice of them all is the fact that Jesus Christ gave up heaven

364
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.880
on earth.

365
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.740
He left heaven to come and live a perfect sinless life so that you

366
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.660
and I could be made right before our king. And that's not fair.

367
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.580
If we think about it,

368
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:42.180
Paul tells us in Romans that Christ gave up his life because of his great love

369
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.033
for us.

370
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.420
You and I deserve a punishment for your premeditated sins.

371
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.620
You and I deserve a consequence for those routine sins that you still do.

372
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.820
Our ugly and grievous mistakes that we made on Thursday,

373
00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.580
those that we're gonna make on Wednesday all deserve a consequence.

374
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.460
But Jesus paid that consequence for us all. Helling Jesus, right?

375
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.883
Friends,

376
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.100
we were the wicked with the teeth and the slime and the slug and uh,

377
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.060
the evaporated water. We were wicked. But through Christ,

378
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.740
through his righteousness, we have been made right?

379
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.340
We've been made clean

380
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.050
Some, some applications to this first, uh, David Rebukes,

381
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.450
the wicked David requests for justice.

382
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.330
And then he rejoices because he knows how the story is.

383
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.370
So what do we do with a text like this today?

384
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.090
One five suggestions for us.

385
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:44.970
Be angry at sin.

386
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.370
Be more angry at sin than the sinner because the reality,

387
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.330
like we just talked about,

388
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.850
you and I are sinners to and in need of a savior.

389
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.330
And if you haven't realized your need for a savior and the beauty of God's

390
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.090
amazing grace, we would love to talk with you. In fact, after this service,

391
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.650
when we're done, we're gonna have people here in the front and on the sides.

392
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.130
And we would love to just pray with you. It doesn't have to be prayer about, uh,

393
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.610
your spiritual state. It could be, uh,

394
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:16.690
a job situation that you want prayer for or a family member who needs help. Uh,

395
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.610
that's sick. You know, whatever it might be.

396
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.050
We would love to be a praying people,

397
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.420
but your sin, your wickedness deserves a consequence.

398
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.580
And Jesus paid that consequence and an unfair debt for you and for me.

399
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.820
And in return for that payment,

400
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.220
the Bible calls us to live a surrendered life to our Lord

401
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.300
also in scripture. Point number two,

402
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:47.420
with a surrendered life that should look like when we encounter people who are

403
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.980
full of sin, who aren't like us.

404
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.660
I think we, we should go to the the greatest commandment.

405
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.820
All four gospel tells us this in some ways, tells us to,

406
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.540
tells us to love the Lord your God, with all of our heart, soul, mind,

407
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.500
and strength, and to love our neighbors as ourself a surrendered life,

408
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.380
one that is angry at sin will seek to love God and love people.

409
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.820
So point number application. Number two, love God and love people,

410
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.700
even sin filled people.

411
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.780
All sorts of people that come to your mind when you think of wickedness.

412
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.680
We're called to love those people. Number three,

413
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:34.280
pray for the repentance of our leaders. When Jesus was on the cross,

414
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.800
his body was bleeding. He cries out. Father,

415
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.200
forgive them for they don't know what they're doing.

416
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.160
So pray for the salvation of our leaders.

417
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.890
Pray for those that have influence.

418
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.760
But the Psalm would kind of suggest to us that if those people do not

419
00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.440
submit their lives to God,

420
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.920
that then we are to pray a different kind of prayer.

421
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.520
A prayer for drastic change.

422
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.760
The Psalm assumes that these wicked rulers would not repent and would not seek

423
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.640
justice. And these violent people are just waiting to pounce on their pray.

424
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.040
So the psalmist is saying, Lord, bring your justice swiftly.

425
00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.120
And maybe that should be our prayer too. Four,

426
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.440
I think there's an application here to care for the oppressed.

427
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.200
When you see abuse happening, call it out. And one of the ways,

428
00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.640
and there's many, we could probably do a whole sermon on this,

429
00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.640
but one of the ways that we can care for those being exploited is to make

430
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.400
aware, however that looks like in your sphere,

431
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.520
but make aware of the injustices for the purpose of pointing people to

432
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.320
Jesus. Not just because they disagree, you disagree with them,

433
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.400
but for the purpose of pointing them to Jesus.

434
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.080
And lastly, an important reminder here.

435
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.880
It's not our responsibility to bring justice, it's God's.

436
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:12.440
David's only action in this psalm is to cry out to God

437
00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.160
because God is the sovereign one. He doesn't change.

438
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.440
We know how the story ends.

439
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.240
True believers of the gospel ought to be enraged at injustices

440
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.800
driving us to our niece in prayer.
