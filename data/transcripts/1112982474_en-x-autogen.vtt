00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:15.725
Welcome to Henderson Hills.

2
00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:21.485
We are disciple makers, anchored in truth, compelled

3
00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:23.925
by love, and desperately dependent on the Lord.

4
00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:27.725
We are generous with what God has given us

5
00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:30.285
and we share life giving help with those around us.

6
00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:35.285
Our mission is to equip one another to love Jesus.

7
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:38.205
And lip syn, we are glad you're here.

8
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.645
Good evening. We're gonna try that one more time.

9
00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:49.445
This is a crowd participation moment

10
00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:53.725
and I get to go as long as I want to until you participate.

11
00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:55.965
Good evening. Good evening.

12
00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:57.965
Ah, I see you guys catch on so quick.

13
00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:00.125
Uh, this is going to be a great night.

14
00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:02.205
We're gonna have a family choir in just a minute.

15
00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.645
Can I have a big round of applause? Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:09.925
And we also have drama and our speaker Richard Ross is back.

17
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:12.165
And of course our, our praise and worship leaders.

18
00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:13.725
It's gonna be a great night.

19
00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:15.925
But lemme tell you what we're going to conclude with.

20
00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:18.925
We'll be concluding with a time of family commitment.

21
00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:21.525
And what does that mean? That means that, uh,

22
00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:23.965
we wanna be more than just about the talk

23
00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:25.325
about family discipleship.

24
00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:27.205
We wanna be in prayer for one another.

25
00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:28.685
We wanna be encouraging one another.

26
00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:31.885
We want to, uh, want this to be kind of our culture.

27
00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:35.245
It's who we are. And so, uh, be praying about that

28
00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:37.205
because you do have a part in this service.

29
00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.805
Uh, we would love for you to sing with us when we sing.

30
00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:41.765
We'd love you to clap with us when we clap.

31
00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:44.405
But more than anything else, we want you to commune

32
00:04:44.405 --> 00:04:47.245
with the Lord because we are here to reclaim the home

33
00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:51.045
as the space for spiritual influence.

34
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.765
And uh, it's not, it's not a top down thing.

35
00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:57.205
It's not a hierarchy where like dad's the boss

36
00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:59.925
or mom's the boss and everybody listens to her.

37
00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:00.925
Speaker, him speak.

38
00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:03.765
This is, uh, we are learning together how

39
00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:06.205
to come into the presence of God through his word

40
00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:08.205
and through the things that he's given us to seek him.

41
00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:10.445
And so it'll be a process

42
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.605
and none of us, none of us are that good at it.

43
00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:14.605
And we have an enemy that would like for us

44
00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:15.685
to be real bad at it.

45
00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:17.645
But tonight, we refuse that enemy

46
00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:19.605
and we join forces with a living God.

47
00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:21.325
And so we're glad that you're here.

48
00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:23.045
Um, I'm gonna start with a prayer

49
00:05:23.145 --> 00:05:24.245
and then we're gonna sing together.

50
00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:26.125
Father, thank you for these families.

51
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:27.605
Thank you for the parents

52
00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:29.365
and kids that have decided to spend,

53
00:05:29.385 --> 00:05:30.485
uh, this evening with us.

54
00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:32.845
Or do we wanna do more than have an event.

55
00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:36.605
We want to have a, a moment, Lord, with you where we're able

56
00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:37.685
to dedicate ourselves

57
00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:40.245
and our families to you getting closer to you

58
00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:42.965
and being stronger for you, uh, for your glory.

59
00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:45.245
And uh, Lord, we thank you for this morning.

60
00:05:45.265 --> 00:05:47.885
We thank you Lord, that we enthroned you with our praise,

61
00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:51.485
that uh, we exalted you as our monarch, as our king.

62
00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:53.845
And we want to continue that right now.

63
00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:56.485
And it's in Jesus and we pray. Amen. Let's stand together.

64
00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:08.485
Alright? We're gonna enjoy worshiping the Lord together

65
00:06:08.485 --> 00:06:10.165
tonight in

66
00:06:10.185 --> 00:06:13.565
the on the mountain.

67
00:06:54.675 --> 00:06:56.885
Lord soul

68
00:07:05.905 --> 00:07:06.125
now

69
00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:17.085
is, it's more

70
00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:32.685
as I I to,

71
00:08:08.085 --> 00:08:09.445
I want you guys to sing this out.

72
00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:13.405
Sing these truth about who God is.

73
00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:18.285
Let's this Him praise

74
00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:22.845

and great grace.

76
00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:29.605
You faithful grace. You true grace.

77
00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:32.445
There's nobody greater than you.

78
00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:37.805
You sovereign grace you, you

79
00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:42.765
and defeated grace.

80
00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:44.365
You true. And

81
00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:19.405
be

82
00:09:22.505 --> 00:09:24.765
how inside.

83
00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:28.045
And God

84
00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:32.205
inside

85
00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:05.995
we worship God.

86
00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:09.945
Who we God, who we

87
00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:13.865
God, who we worship God.

88
00:11:18.085 --> 00:11:20.665
He opened the he

89
00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:34.265
the

90
00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:53.895
beg.

91
00:12:56.995 --> 00:12:57.455
We were

92
00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:08.415
we.

93
00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:49.415
The,

94
00:14:10.635 --> 00:14:10.855
the,

95
00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:56.415
the.

96
00:15:17.095 --> 00:15:20.065
Amen. I'm gonna pray for us. Uh, Jesus.

97
00:15:20.405 --> 00:15:24.145
Um, we want to give you, um, all of the glory

98
00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:28.265
and all of the honor and the praise, um, this evening

99
00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:32.985
as we, um, we just commit this time to you, to um,

100
00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:34.105
hear from your word

101
00:15:34.285 --> 00:15:39.225
and to, um, commit time to, um, uh, caring

102
00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:43.825
for and discipling intentionally, uh, through the gospel,

103
00:15:44.605 --> 00:15:45.625
uh, our families.

104
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:48.225
Lord, uh, would you, um,

105
00:15:49.675 --> 00:15:50.905
would you move in a special

106
00:15:51.565 --> 00:15:54.665
and an intentional way this evening as we do that?

107
00:15:54.665 --> 00:15:58.505
Lord, uh, we love you and we pray this in Jesus' name.

108
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.305
Amen. Amen. You may be seated.

109
00:16:09.785 --> 00:16:13.515
Okay guys, I need you guys to all stop your performances

110
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:14.955
and come sit at the table.

111
00:16:15.025 --> 00:16:16.635
Come on guys. We want to talk about something

112
00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:17.795
that's bigger than your hobbies.

113
00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:19.355
Bigger than all your talents,

114
00:16:19.415 --> 00:16:21.195
Bigger than a lead role, bigger

115
00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:21.875
Than a home. Run

116
00:16:21.895 --> 00:16:23.155
Bigger than my aura.

117
00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:25.595
Okay guys, that is all fun.

118
00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:29.035
But nothing lasts longer than your relationship with Jesus.

119
00:16:29.945 --> 00:16:33.155
Life is messy, but God loves us through it.

120
00:16:33.675 --> 00:16:35.635
I mean, I forget to pray sometimes,

121
00:16:35.775 --> 00:16:37.515
or I yell at my brothers. That's

122
00:16:37.515 --> 00:16:38.515
Okay. Penny loving God

123
00:16:38.515 --> 00:16:39.955
isn't about perfection.

124
00:16:40.465 --> 00:16:42.675
It's about trusting him with your whole life

125
00:16:42.975 --> 00:16:44.515
and pointing others to Jesus.

126
00:16:45.775 --> 00:16:46.995
So helping people

127
00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:49.475
and following God is greater than a home run.

128
00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:52.435
So my skills just gifts.

129
00:16:52.985 --> 00:16:57.475
Exactly. Gifts to share, but not badges of honor.

130
00:16:58.265 --> 00:17:00.555
Fine. But can I still sing loudly in the car?

131
00:17:01.135 --> 00:17:03.475
Of course, penny, your talents are wonderful.

132
00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:05.635
Just remember who you're glorifying.

133
00:17:06.495 --> 00:17:09.275
Oh, so if my heart's in the right place,

134
00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:10.875
then I'm honoring God.

135
00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:15.795
Yes. So we use our talents to draw attention to God

136
00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.475
and not ourselves.

137
00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:29.095
Talent. I love this church.

138
00:17:29.335 --> 00:17:30.935
I love a talented church.

139
00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:35.135
All of you were brilliant to come here to be a part

140
00:17:35.135 --> 00:17:36.415
of this community of faith.

141
00:17:36.835 --> 00:17:39.775
But in addition to that, I would have to say, those of you

142
00:17:39.775 --> 00:17:42.215
that are actively parenting these days,

143
00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:45.215
what an absolutely wonderful church

144
00:17:45.395 --> 00:17:47.175
to be rearing children in.

145
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.605
I may move my membership from the nursing home to here.

146
00:17:50.925 --> 00:17:51.965
I love what you

147
00:17:52.145 --> 00:17:54.885
and God have created in this particular place.

148
00:17:56.235 --> 00:17:58.765
What if you know this is a participation service?

149
00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:02.845
What if I said, okay, we're gonna do a big participation.

150
00:18:03.145 --> 00:18:04.285
Now this would be interesting.

151
00:18:04.795 --> 00:18:08.005
There's so many of you, I don't think logistically

152
00:18:08.035 --> 00:18:09.085
that this would work,

153
00:18:09.225 --> 00:18:11.605
but I do want you to use your imagination.

154
00:18:11.835 --> 00:18:15.485
What if right now in the service, I ask everyone

155
00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:16.685
to stand to their feet?

156
00:18:17.345 --> 00:18:22.285
And strangely, what if I invited everyone of every age

157
00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:26.485
to come and pack this front area right here?

158
00:18:26.595 --> 00:18:28.525
Once again, I don't think we would fit.

159
00:18:29.105 --> 00:18:30.445
But if we could fit,

160
00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:35.285
and you did come to the front, what if I had given

161
00:18:35.805 --> 00:18:38.365
positions that I wanted groups to stay in?

162
00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:41.565
I think most of you, you know, you would try to cooperate.

163
00:18:41.635 --> 00:18:44.605
Most of you would try to stand where you're supposed to.

164
00:18:45.275 --> 00:18:46.685
What if this had been the plan?

165
00:18:47.715 --> 00:18:50.205
What if I had said everybody up, everybody walked

166
00:18:50.205 --> 00:18:53.245
to the front and I want to create one group right here.

167
00:18:54.185 --> 00:18:57.245
And if you choose this group, you will be saying,

168
00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:01.005
I'm on my way toward God.

169
00:19:02.605 --> 00:19:06.085
Somebody is out there and I'm trying to figure this out.

170
00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:08.685
Somebody invited me to come tonight. I thought a church.

171
00:19:08.685 --> 00:19:10.405
Well that's a good place to find answers.

172
00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:14.205
So I'm here tonight to say I'm on my way toward God.

173
00:19:14.665 --> 00:19:16.725
Now, if we really did the demonstration

174
00:19:16.725 --> 00:19:19.565
and if we really had a group here, I think all

175
00:19:19.565 --> 00:19:21.005
of you would be thrilled to death.

176
00:19:21.225 --> 00:19:23.485
Praise God, appreciate their honesty.

177
00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:26.565
But even though you'd be happy about this group,

178
00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:29.165
the vast majority of you would say, yeah,

179
00:19:29.185 --> 00:19:31.485
but that's not exactly where I should stand.

180
00:19:32.575 --> 00:19:34.965
Maybe a bunch of you would say, I ought

181
00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.005
to stand right here in front of the preacher,

182
00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:42.205
and by standing here I will be saying, well,

183
00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:44.965
there was a time in my life I was on my way toward God.

184
00:19:44.965 --> 00:19:47.445
Finally, somebody explained I could know God

185
00:19:47.445 --> 00:19:48.485
through his son Jesus.

186
00:19:48.525 --> 00:19:51.045
Christ's death on the cross. I received that.

187
00:19:52.075 --> 00:19:53.655
But the reason I'm standing here

188
00:19:53.675 --> 00:19:58.055
and not some other places is even though I know Jesus

189
00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:02.655
these days, really the most important person in my world

190
00:20:02.865 --> 00:20:04.375
would be me.

191
00:20:04.515 --> 00:20:07.415
Now. Now by that I mean, you know, during the week,

192
00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:11.375
just trying to get by my crazy kids, my finances, my health,

193
00:20:11.595 --> 00:20:13.535
you know, just the things that make up life.

194
00:20:13.895 --> 00:20:16.215
I would have to say that's probably on my mind

195
00:20:16.445 --> 00:20:17.495
most of the time.

196
00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:21.215
Now I do pray, in fact, I don't even know

197
00:20:21.215 --> 00:20:23.215
how these people get by if you can't tell

198
00:20:23.215 --> 00:20:24.375
Jesus your troubles.

199
00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:27.095
But you know, even when I'm telling him my troubles,

200
00:20:27.515 --> 00:20:30.975
really my preoccupation is with me.

201
00:20:31.715 --> 00:20:33.575
Now, the group that ought to be right here,

202
00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:38.335
very humble people would never take credit for any of this.

203
00:20:39.315 --> 00:20:41.335
But a person standing here might say,

204
00:20:41.335 --> 00:20:43.615
there was a time I was on my way toward God.

205
00:20:43.615 --> 00:20:46.335
Finally somebody explained I could know him through Christ.

206
00:20:47.465 --> 00:20:50.805
And since I came to know him, I cannot take credit

207
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:52.725
for anything in my Christian life.

208
00:20:53.025 --> 00:20:54.805
It is only the work of God.

209
00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:58.765
But somehow by his grace tonight, I would have

210
00:20:58.765 --> 00:21:02.885
to say the preoccupation of my life is Jesus.

211
00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:06.245
Now I have the same problems as everybody else.

212
00:21:06.585 --> 00:21:08.965
Oh my goodness, I could tell you my troubles.

213
00:21:09.265 --> 00:21:11.005
But you know, even in my tough times,

214
00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:14.645
really what's on my mind is, oh, I wonder

215
00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:16.685
how Jesus will reveal himself through this.

216
00:21:17.105 --> 00:21:19.685
Oh, I wonder how he will bring his kingdom on earth

217
00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:21.765
through this same thing from our family.

218
00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:23.445
I mean, we might be sitting on the couch

219
00:21:23.725 --> 00:21:25.685
and we're saying, boy, this is tough.

220
00:21:25.755 --> 00:21:28.525
This is heart. I wonder what Jesus will do

221
00:21:28.525 --> 00:21:30.045
to receive glory through this.

222
00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:33.725
So even for my family, the preoccupation

223
00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:36.005
of our lives is Jesus

224
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:41.525
lost, convert

225
00:21:42.825 --> 00:21:47.445
and to use Jesus's favorite name for these people, disciple,

226
00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:51.445
lost, convert, disciple.

227
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.365
Did you know we have some really great research

228
00:21:55.675 --> 00:21:58.565
that tells us what happens to kids after they leave home.

229
00:21:59.745 --> 00:22:03.325
The research says if I grow up, you know, 18 years

230
00:22:04.345 --> 00:22:08.205
in the home and nobody knows Jesus in that house,

231
00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:12.445
statistically speaking, the odds are that I will leave

232
00:22:12.445 --> 00:22:16.005
that home and I will spend my entire adult life

233
00:22:16.515 --> 00:22:17.925
spiritually lost.

234
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:21.645
Now, you and I both know there are some exceptions.

235
00:22:21.705 --> 00:22:23.325
In fact, several of you tonight

236
00:22:23.985 --> 00:22:27.165
are the exception you would say, I grew up in a home, nobody

237
00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:29.805
of faith in that house by a miracle of God,

238
00:22:29.925 --> 00:22:31.005
I met him in adulthood.

239
00:22:31.805 --> 00:22:33.525
Absolutely exceptions exist,

240
00:22:34.665 --> 00:22:36.165
but there's not very many of them.

241
00:22:36.795 --> 00:22:38.885
That same research says is,

242
00:22:40.375 --> 00:22:42.835
if I grow up 18 years and my mom

243
00:22:42.855 --> 00:22:46.155
and dad are disciples, not perfect of course,

244
00:22:46.855 --> 00:22:48.755
but in general, my mom

245
00:22:48.775 --> 00:22:51.315
and dad live with Jesus front and center.

246
00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:54.035
He's a topic of conversation in our house.

247
00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:56.675
I watch them make decisions under him.

248
00:22:56.975 --> 00:23:01.675
If I watch that for 18 years, statistically speaking,

249
00:23:02.155 --> 00:23:05.835
I will grow up and be an adult disciple.

250
00:23:07.015 --> 00:23:09.035
Now again, there are a few exceptions.

251
00:23:09.175 --> 00:23:11.435
You can grow up with two disciple parents

252
00:23:11.855 --> 00:23:15.395
and by a strong act of your will, you can reject all of that

253
00:23:15.455 --> 00:23:16.715
and live like the devil.

254
00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:19.635
Yes. But again, the exceptions

255
00:23:20.575 --> 00:23:21.995
are few and far between.

256
00:23:22.905 --> 00:23:26.835
Basically lost homes, create lost adults,

257
00:23:27.715 --> 00:23:29.995
disciple homes create disciple adults,

258
00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:35.815
convert homes, produce young adults

259
00:23:37.205 --> 00:23:40.015
that tend to live their adult lives

260
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.535
as if they're lost.

261
00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:45.205
Now I'm not talking about losing your salvation,

262
00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:46.965
I'm really talking about lifestyle.

263
00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:48.605
Let, let me show you how this works.

264
00:23:49.775 --> 00:23:50.845
Let's just say I'm a kid.

265
00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:53.645
If I grow up in a home, you know, 18 years

266
00:23:54.385 --> 00:23:56.325
and we go down to the church on Sunday,

267
00:23:56.425 --> 00:23:59.325
at least most Sundays, and we fit in just fine.

268
00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:01.405
We know how to say the words, you know, we do fine.

269
00:24:02.905 --> 00:24:05.725
But when we get home, you know, Monday through Saturday,

270
00:24:06.915 --> 00:24:09.925
that church business doesn't seem to come up very much.

271
00:24:10.265 --> 00:24:13.365
It just seems like all the conversation in our house is

272
00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:15.885
about cheerleading and travel ball and SAT scores

273
00:24:15.945 --> 00:24:17.645
and scholarships and a hundred other things.

274
00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:20.285
The dissonance, the dissonance between

275
00:24:20.285 --> 00:24:22.365
that Sunday morning profession

276
00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:26.045
and what I can tell is really most important in our home.

277
00:24:26.315 --> 00:24:29.845
That dissonance, it fries my wiring so much so

278
00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:32.045
that when I go off to the big university,

279
00:24:33.165 --> 00:24:35.845
I don't have enough faith to hold me.

280
00:24:37.065 --> 00:24:39.245
Any campus minister will tell you

281
00:24:40.885 --> 00:24:45.375
when those freshmen walk on campus, really in only two

282
00:24:45.435 --> 00:24:47.935
or three weeks, they are already starting

283
00:24:48.035 --> 00:24:51.335
to behave like the law students.

284
00:24:55.085 --> 00:24:59.135
Perhaps one of the most important sentences of this

285
00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:04.095
entire evening will be the

286
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:05.815
next sentence.

287
00:25:08.135 --> 00:25:12.895
If you're a parent, the future of your children

288
00:25:13.675 --> 00:25:18.415
hinges primarily on the spiritual condition

289
00:25:18.675 --> 00:25:20.615
of your heart.

290
00:25:21.435 --> 00:25:26.095
The future of your children hinges primarily on the

291
00:25:26.455 --> 00:25:29.575
spiritual condition of your heart.

292
00:25:31.175 --> 00:25:32.755
Now let's see what that kind

293
00:25:32.755 --> 00:25:35.875
of spiritual life might look like in the home.

294
00:26:14.305 --> 00:26:16.035
Time to sit down, provide steady.

295
00:26:17.815 --> 00:26:19.875
You all are going to love tonight's reading.

296
00:26:20.135 --> 00:26:22.715
It has, it's short, it's powerful,

297
00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:24.355
and it has a great question.

298
00:26:25.155 --> 00:26:27.235
I bookmark this chapter this morning.

299
00:26:27.795 --> 00:26:29.475
I love when Jesus teaches in parables.

300
00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:35.475
Yay. Can't wait to decode spiritual mysteries while try,

301
00:26:35.495 --> 00:26:37.355
my brother tries to body slam me.

302
00:26:38.175 --> 00:26:39.595
I'm coming. Just one more swing.

303
00:26:40.325 --> 00:26:43.965
Boone family discipleship now or no cages tomorrow.

304
00:26:46.075 --> 00:26:48.045
Alright, but can we just read fast?

305
00:26:48.155 --> 00:26:50.925
Because Jesus knew people had stuff to do.

306
00:26:52.265 --> 00:26:54.045
Hey Susie, I need you to come sit down.

307
00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:57.805
Okay, everybody listen up. Eyes over here.

308
00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:01.605
We're gonna read from Luke 15, uh,

309
00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:03.405
the Parable of the lost Sheep.

310
00:27:04.385 --> 00:27:06.685
Oh wow. Never heard that one before.

311
00:27:07.475 --> 00:27:08.725
Does it have a twist ending?

312
00:27:09.945 --> 00:27:14.925
Six, seven. Okay. Okay. Everyone needs to listen up.

313
00:27:15.435 --> 00:27:17.405
Okay. Uh, here we go.

314
00:27:18.265 --> 00:27:20.045
So pose one of you has a hundred

315
00:27:20.175 --> 00:27:21.605
sheep and loses one of them.

316
00:27:22.395 --> 00:27:25.645
Does he leave the 99 in the open country and go

317
00:27:25.645 --> 00:27:27.885
after the lost sheep until he finds it?

318
00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:29.965
I'm the last sheep?

319
00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:33.925
That's actually a great metaphor. Boon.

320
00:27:35.715 --> 00:27:38.005
Yeah. If the lost sheep was annoying

321
00:27:38.105 --> 00:27:39.445
and didn't take showers,

322
00:27:40.505 --> 00:27:41.525
I'm the shepherd. I

323
00:27:41.525 --> 00:27:42.525
Found her.

324
00:27:43.025 --> 00:27:45.645
Get Boone. Her neck is in a sheep handle.

325
00:27:46.175 --> 00:27:48.285
Boone, we're not wrestling right now.

326
00:27:49.955 --> 00:27:54.765
Okay? Okay, let's finish this.

327
00:27:57.625 --> 00:27:58.885
And when he finds it,

328
00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:02.205
he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home.

329
00:28:02.825 --> 00:28:07.005
See Boone joyfully. Not like WWE.

330
00:28:08.045 --> 00:28:09.605
Honestly, I don't see why the

331
00:28:09.685 --> 00:28:10.925
shepherd believed the nine, nine sheep.

332
00:28:11.465 --> 00:28:14.445
It shows how much God values even one lost person.

333
00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:18.165
Like even when we're all being crazy,

334
00:28:18.675 --> 00:28:19.765
he's still looking for us.

335
00:28:20.845 --> 00:28:23.005
Hmm. So God would come

336
00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:25.365
after me even if I ditched the group to go play baseball.

337
00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:31.065
Exactly. I mean, that's kind of cool, I guess.

338
00:28:33.105 --> 00:28:34.305
I guess they learned something.

339
00:28:34.825 --> 00:28:36.585
I mean, it's more than I thought they'd get out of it.

340
00:28:37.485 --> 00:28:39.105
Mother, are we dismissed

341
00:28:40.295 --> 00:28:41.295
Next time? Can we do

342
00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:41.845
revelation?

343
00:28:46.845 --> 00:28:47.265
My hand?

344
00:28:53.645 --> 00:28:57.465
Do conversations like that matter? Absolutely. They matter.

345
00:28:57.895 --> 00:29:01.785
Conversations about Jesus, about scripture matter.

346
00:29:02.735 --> 00:29:05.105
Just a few moments ago, I said, the future

347
00:29:05.205 --> 00:29:07.785
of your children hinges primarily on the spiritual

348
00:29:07.785 --> 00:29:08.825
condition of your heart.

349
00:29:09.085 --> 00:29:12.225
And conversations like that is part of the way

350
00:29:12.615 --> 00:29:14.825
that you show kids what's in your heart?

351
00:29:16.165 --> 00:29:18.225
Now, when I say mom

352
00:29:18.225 --> 00:29:21.305
and dad are the biggest influence, somebody might protest.

353
00:29:21.945 --> 00:29:23.985
Somebody might say, brother Richard, you're from Texas.

354
00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:25.625
You're, you're not from around here.

355
00:29:25.965 --> 00:29:28.025
You don't really know about this church.

356
00:29:28.245 --> 00:29:29.265
You don't understand.

357
00:29:29.925 --> 00:29:33.625
We have an absolutely wonderful children's ministry here.

358
00:29:33.725 --> 00:29:37.065
We have a superb youth ministry here. And you do.

359
00:29:37.905 --> 00:29:41.925
I mean, it's well known away from here and that does matter.

360
00:29:42.075 --> 00:29:45.045
I'll talk about that later. But mom and dad, listen to me.

361
00:29:46.275 --> 00:29:48.605
What you cannot do is assume,

362
00:29:49.345 --> 00:29:51.445
my primary responsibility was

363
00:29:51.445 --> 00:29:53.485
to get my family in a good church

364
00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:56.965
and just hope those good people at the church house will

365
00:29:57.075 --> 00:30:00.005
somehow make my kids religious.

366
00:30:01.115 --> 00:30:02.725
This is not dry cleaning.

367
00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:04.565
You do not drop off children

368
00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:07.565
and then hope to pick them up clean and press later on.

369
00:30:08.425 --> 00:30:12.125
The research says, and scripture says, mom

370
00:30:12.305 --> 00:30:14.245
and dad are by far in the way,

371
00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:18.765
the strongest influence spiritually on their children.

372
00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:23.525
Now I wanna take you back to our opening, uh, demonstration.

373
00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:27.045
If we really had done that thing

374
00:30:27.185 --> 00:30:29.925
and if people really had come forward

375
00:30:30.465 --> 00:30:32.725
and you would've found yourself standing here,

376
00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:36.645
I do wanna say, as wonderful

377
00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:39.085
as this evening is dealing with lots

378
00:30:39.085 --> 00:30:40.565
of different subjects for you.

379
00:30:40.615 --> 00:30:43.005
There is nothing going on here tonight.

380
00:30:43.155 --> 00:30:45.245
More important than you deciding.

381
00:30:45.645 --> 00:30:48.445
I think I would like to know Jesus as my savior.

382
00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:50.725
I would like to have a relationship with him.

383
00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:54.285
I would like for him to permeate all my relationships,

384
00:30:54.395 --> 00:30:56.885
including my family for you.

385
00:30:57.665 --> 00:30:59.205
You listen for his voice.

386
00:30:59.515 --> 00:31:01.485
That is your agenda for this evening.

387
00:31:02.705 --> 00:31:05.845
But again, I think the great majority of you are saying,

388
00:31:06.245 --> 00:31:07.645
I know the Lord.

389
00:31:08.345 --> 00:31:13.085
The question for me tonight is, well, am I a convert

390
00:31:13.265 --> 00:31:14.765
or am I a disciple?

391
00:31:14.995 --> 00:31:16.205
It's an interesting question.

392
00:31:17.465 --> 00:31:20.525
Now, in 2025, we have lots of meters,

393
00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.525
but we don't have a meter we can poke you with

394
00:31:23.835 --> 00:31:25.725
that says convert or disciple.

395
00:31:25.825 --> 00:31:28.725
We don't have one of those. So all I can do is

396
00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:30.045
ask you some questions.

397
00:31:31.955 --> 00:31:33.975
Mom and dad, go deep inside yourself

398
00:31:33.995 --> 00:31:38.135
and ask yourself a very important question,

399
00:31:40.195 --> 00:31:43.485
what matters to you most about your children?

400
00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:48.125
What goal for your children stands above all others?

401
00:31:49.525 --> 00:31:50.885
I wonder if there's someone tonight

402
00:31:50.885 --> 00:31:52.125
that would say, brother Richard.

403
00:31:52.765 --> 00:31:56.645
Actually what I'm working on the hardest is I want my kids

404
00:31:56.785 --> 00:31:59.245
to succeed at whatever they take on whatever

405
00:31:59.245 --> 00:32:00.285
they get interested in.

406
00:32:00.985 --> 00:32:02.685
I'm trying to give them a leg up.

407
00:32:02.865 --> 00:32:04.085
I'm trying to support them.

408
00:32:04.565 --> 00:32:06.725
I want my kids to succeed in life.

409
00:32:07.665 --> 00:32:09.645
But others of you might say, well, that's nice,

410
00:32:09.945 --> 00:32:11.365
but it's not most important.

411
00:32:11.385 --> 00:32:14.685
Really what I'm working on is I want my kids

412
00:32:14.745 --> 00:32:17.725
to be reasonably happy as they grow up.

413
00:32:17.885 --> 00:32:19.605
I hear about these college students,

414
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:21.965
these young adults taking their lives.

415
00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:24.685
That's terrible. I don't want my kids part of that,

416
00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:28.045
so I want them to be reasonably happy in life.

417
00:32:28.985 --> 00:32:31.805
Others of you might say, both of you have missed it.

418
00:32:32.745 --> 00:32:36.045
The most important thing is I want my kids to be moral.

419
00:32:36.245 --> 00:32:37.365
I want them to be upright.

420
00:32:37.765 --> 00:32:40.965
I mean, people are doing crazy things out there

421
00:32:41.305 --> 00:32:43.765
and I don't want my kids becoming part of that.

422
00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:46.325
So I'm working on that every day.

423
00:32:48.055 --> 00:32:49.355
Now those are nice things,

424
00:32:50.595 --> 00:32:54.655
but you would find this interesting when we do quality

425
00:32:55.215 --> 00:32:59.295
research and we ask middle class

426
00:32:59.855 --> 00:33:02.825
atheists who have children at home,

427
00:33:04.095 --> 00:33:07.105
what is your primary goal in rearing your children?

428
00:33:07.275 --> 00:33:11.865
Those middle class atheists will either answer success,

429
00:33:13.255 --> 00:33:15.585
happiness, or morality.

430
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:20.945
If we in the church, if we the people of God say, well,

431
00:33:21.005 --> 00:33:22.865
my goals are happiness, success,

432
00:33:22.865 --> 00:33:27.145
and morality, actually we have the same goals as the people

433
00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:28.745
who think there is no God.

434
00:33:30.825 --> 00:33:34.615
Would you say, I'm a disciple, I'm a mom, I'm a dad.

435
00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:37.695
I'm a single adult that cares about other children.

436
00:33:38.185 --> 00:33:40.135
Would you say I am a disciple?

437
00:33:41.475 --> 00:33:44.335
One way you can detect that is first for yourself,

438
00:33:44.345 --> 00:33:48.975
would you say, I live, my primary goal in living is

439
00:33:48.975 --> 00:33:50.095
for the glory of God.

440
00:33:50.555 --> 00:33:54.735
And consequently, the highest goal I have

441
00:33:54.755 --> 00:33:57.695
for my children is I want to see them

442
00:33:58.245 --> 00:34:02.015
live their complete lives for the glory of God.

443
00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:07.405
Is that true for you? I wanna give you three

444
00:34:07.885 --> 00:34:09.645
challenges, and I want to help you

445
00:34:09.645 --> 00:34:11.005
understand all three of these.

446
00:34:12.045 --> 00:34:14.985
And actually now these challenges are

447
00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:16.745
for the complete church for everyone,

448
00:34:17.035 --> 00:34:19.025
grade schoolers, teenagers, and adults.

449
00:34:20.325 --> 00:34:24.985
My first challenge to you is you be awakened

450
00:34:25.125 --> 00:34:26.465
to the greatness of Christ.

451
00:34:27.085 --> 00:34:28.785
You say, brother Richard, that sounds a lot

452
00:34:28.785 --> 00:34:29.985
like your sermon this morning.

453
00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:32.345
Well, it is like my sermon this morning

454
00:34:32.615 --> 00:34:35.225
because that is the first step

455
00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:38.465
in creating spiritually alive homes.

456
00:34:40.345 --> 00:34:42.205
Let me just ask you a question tonight

457
00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:43.965
that I didn't ask you this morning.

458
00:34:46.525 --> 00:34:49.965
Believer of any age, is it possible

459
00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:53.325
that you have lost your first

460
00:34:54.155 --> 00:34:56.375
love in Jesus?

461
00:34:56.885 --> 00:35:00.055
Many of you familiar with Revelation two, two through four.

462
00:35:00.545 --> 00:35:01.695
Jesus was speaking

463
00:35:02.835 --> 00:35:05.655
and he said, you have done some good things,

464
00:35:06.235 --> 00:35:10.535
but you have lost your first love.

465
00:35:12.445 --> 00:35:14.375
Believe. Let me ask you a question.

466
00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:18.615
Can you go back to an earlier time in your life?

467
00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:20.615
Can you go back to a time

468
00:35:21.165 --> 00:35:24.535
when you would say Jesus was more real to me?

469
00:35:24.725 --> 00:35:28.015
Then I walked more closely with him, then

470
00:35:28.575 --> 00:35:30.455
I was more alive in him.

471
00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:33.815
Then maybe for someone here tonight, you would say, oh,

472
00:35:33.935 --> 00:35:35.255
I was in a Christian youth group.

473
00:35:35.435 --> 00:35:37.605
Oh my goodness, we were so close.

474
00:35:38.665 --> 00:35:41.645
Or maybe for somebody else it was a collegiate ministry

475
00:35:41.665 --> 00:35:43.245
and you would say, man, we were singing

476
00:35:43.305 --> 00:35:44.805
and worshiping late in the night.

477
00:35:45.245 --> 00:35:48.765
I, oh, in my college days, I was so close to him.

478
00:35:48.825 --> 00:35:50.805
Or maybe, maybe you were in a church

479
00:35:50.805 --> 00:35:52.565
that had some wonderful young couples

480
00:35:52.565 --> 00:35:54.765
and y'all were just growing in Christ.

481
00:35:55.705 --> 00:35:57.085
I'm just asking everybody,

482
00:35:58.645 --> 00:36:01.835
would you say there was a time in your life you were closer

483
00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:04.875
to Jesus than you are tonight?

484
00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:10.905
If so, may I just invite you to come back

485
00:36:11.005 --> 00:36:12.465
to your first love.

486
00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:17.885
If you come back to Jesus as your first love,

487
00:36:18.235 --> 00:36:21.285
that is gonna saturate, that's going to permeate

488
00:36:21.865 --> 00:36:23.005
not only parenting,

489
00:36:23.025 --> 00:36:25.485
but any other relationships that you have.

490
00:36:27.305 --> 00:36:29.565
The second challenge I want to give you is this.

491
00:36:30.945 --> 00:36:35.365
Be transparent about your awakening.

492
00:36:35.875 --> 00:36:39.475
Transparent. Now let me just say this to parents.

493
00:36:39.585 --> 00:36:42.515
Parents, some of you are private people. I understand that.

494
00:36:43.215 --> 00:36:46.195
And there's nothing wrong with having a a personality

495
00:36:46.685 --> 00:36:49.475
where you're just a little bit more inside yourself.

496
00:36:49.475 --> 00:36:53.525
That's okay. But you do have to be careful

497
00:36:54.195 --> 00:36:57.685
because you could experience a rebirth.

498
00:36:57.745 --> 00:37:00.445
You could experience a new first love in Jesus

499
00:37:00.865 --> 00:37:04.805
and yet be so private that nobody knows about it.

500
00:37:06.635 --> 00:37:09.755
I wanna challenge all of you, whatever you consider home,

501
00:37:10.155 --> 00:37:13.595
whatever that is for you, talk about Jesus

502
00:37:14.215 --> 00:37:15.315
in that place.

503
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:18.795
Not just religion, not just the church,

504
00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:23.035
not just Christianity, but talk about Jesus.

505
00:37:24.095 --> 00:37:25.675
And if you've got children in the house,

506
00:37:25.815 --> 00:37:28.355
my suggestion would be when you talk about Jesus,

507
00:37:29.015 --> 00:37:30.995
let there be a sparkle in your eye.

508
00:37:31.335 --> 00:37:34.235
Let there be a sound of your voice that sounds like

509
00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:39.035
this is a being I adore and I love with all of my heart.

510
00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:42.395
I also want to challenge you as a way

511
00:37:42.395 --> 00:37:45.155
to let the kids know what's going on inside you.

512
00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:47.795
Pray with your family.

513
00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:52.175
I think saying grace over mealtime is perfectly fine.

514
00:37:52.335 --> 00:37:53.575
I think it's a wonderful custom,

515
00:37:53.955 --> 00:37:55.815
but that's not what I'm talking about.

516
00:37:56.715 --> 00:37:58.095
Beyond mealtime.

517
00:37:59.855 --> 00:38:02.855
I believe every Christian family ought

518
00:38:02.855 --> 00:38:04.815
to pray together as a family.

519
00:38:05.995 --> 00:38:08.375
We might have some wrestling involved.

520
00:38:08.595 --> 00:38:10.895
We might have some creative comments involved.

521
00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:15.015
It doesn't matter. You're talking to Jesus as a family

522
00:38:15.755 --> 00:38:16.895
and closely related.

523
00:38:17.155 --> 00:38:20.455
I'm challenging you to read the Bible as a family.

524
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:24.105
It doesn't have to be a lecture, it doesn't have

525
00:38:24.105 --> 00:38:25.545
to be a 30 minute sermon.

526
00:38:25.735 --> 00:38:30.505
It's just the fact that your family had the word of God open

527
00:38:30.885 --> 00:38:33.465
and kids grow up remembering, oh yeah,

528
00:38:34.565 --> 00:38:36.045
it was real at my house.

529
00:38:36.705 --> 00:38:39.685
We actually read the Bible as a family.

530
00:38:40.065 --> 00:38:42.125
Let that be part of their heritage.

531
00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:47.255
Show your delight in Jesus and his kingdom

532
00:38:47.435 --> 00:38:49.535
and that will affect the DNA of your children.

533
00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:53.815
Third partner with your church

534
00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:59.435
to see your children walk in faith, a lifetime partner

535
00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:02.955
with your church to see your children walk in

536
00:39:02.955 --> 00:39:04.195
faith a lifetime.

537
00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:08.475
I think most of you know the statistics, the kids

538
00:39:08.475 --> 00:39:11.035
that grow up in church, actually those

539
00:39:11.035 --> 00:39:14.755
that are here tonight, the children that grow up in church

540
00:39:15.735 --> 00:39:20.275
at 18 or 19 or 20, about half stay in the church

541
00:39:20.455 --> 00:39:23.155
and about half walk away from the church.

542
00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:25.875
I'm not talking about the pagan masses

543
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:26.955
in the in the community.

544
00:39:27.055 --> 00:39:28.555
I'm talking about church kids.

545
00:39:30.755 --> 00:39:34.955
I hope it matters to you which half your children end up in.

546
00:39:35.935 --> 00:39:40.435
And I wanna say to you, partnering with your church is part

547
00:39:40.455 --> 00:39:42.435
of the way you get kids

548
00:39:42.435 --> 00:39:44.955
that walk in faith the rest of their lives.

549
00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:49.755
Parents, you are in first position. Nothing can change that.

550
00:39:49.855 --> 00:39:53.195
You are gonna have more influence than anything or anybody,

551
00:39:53.695 --> 00:39:58.035
but you can certainly appreciate a church coming

552
00:39:58.545 --> 00:40:02.275
alongside you and supporting you in the process.

553
00:40:03.745 --> 00:40:08.075
This vision that God has given Pastor Phil, it, it is a way

554
00:40:08.415 --> 00:40:10.635
for mom and dad to take the lead,

555
00:40:10.655 --> 00:40:13.555
but the church to come right in behind you saying,

556
00:40:13.965 --> 00:40:16.515
we're gonna do everything we can to stand with you

557
00:40:16.575 --> 00:40:20.875
as a family, to see your kids walk in faith for a lifetime.

558
00:40:22.125 --> 00:40:24.585
Mom and dad, if you figure this out, did you know it changes

559
00:40:25.965 --> 00:40:27.345
how you listen to announcements?

560
00:40:27.615 --> 00:40:28.705
Does that sound strange?

561
00:40:30.465 --> 00:40:32.025
Somebody comes up here on Sunday morning

562
00:40:32.085 --> 00:40:34.105
and makes an announcement or runs some video

563
00:40:34.685 --> 00:40:37.065
and it's about a family this or a family that.

564
00:40:37.065 --> 00:40:38.345
Or here we're gonna pull a family

565
00:40:38.725 --> 00:40:41.025
and you, you say, oh, that, that looks good.

566
00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:42.025
That goes in my phone.

567
00:40:42.085 --> 00:40:43.265
And you get that phone out

568
00:40:43.405 --> 00:40:45.545
and you're kind of chuckling to yourself

569
00:40:45.545 --> 00:40:47.465
and you're thinking, you know, six months ago,

570
00:40:48.165 --> 00:40:51.465
my heart was a little spiritually cold, stuff like that.

571
00:40:51.665 --> 00:40:54.105
I didn't pay any attention to that at all. But I do now.

572
00:40:54.565 --> 00:40:56.945
Why? Because I've had an awakening in my life

573
00:40:57.005 --> 00:41:00.465
and now I'm interested in anything this church is gonna do

574
00:41:00.845 --> 00:41:02.865
to help my family grow spiritually.

575
00:41:04.245 --> 00:41:06.425
But of course, for this church to be a help

576
00:41:06.445 --> 00:41:09.245
to you, you have to be here.

577
00:41:11.155 --> 00:41:15.335
What do you do when you have this exciting opportunity

578
00:41:15.435 --> 00:41:19.855
to have a child travel balls six straight Sunday mornings?

579
00:41:19.855 --> 00:41:21.295
And you're thinking, well, that's exciting,

580
00:41:21.395 --> 00:41:24.815
but man, six Sunday mornings of worship and Bible study.

581
00:41:24.885 --> 00:41:27.375
That kind of seems important. What am I to do?

582
00:41:28.045 --> 00:41:29.975
What do you do when you get two flyers

583
00:41:30.835 --> 00:41:33.885
and you discover in those two flyers that cheerleading camp

584
00:41:34.145 --> 00:41:36.565
and the youth mission trip are the same dates?

585
00:41:36.945 --> 00:41:40.685
How do you decide you're doing a little

586
00:41:40.685 --> 00:41:41.765
bit better financially?

587
00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.925
You've got a little bit of wiggle room

588
00:41:44.025 --> 00:41:45.245
and you're thinking, hmm,

589
00:41:45.675 --> 00:41:47.525
more getaway Weekends for my family.

590
00:41:47.555 --> 00:41:49.085
That might be fun, but gosh,

591
00:41:49.385 --> 00:41:51.085
it seems like maybe being faithful

592
00:41:51.085 --> 00:41:52.525
to the church could be important.

593
00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:57.125
What am I to do? I'm not standing here tonight to tell you

594
00:41:57.235 --> 00:41:58.805
what your decisions ought to be,

595
00:41:58.905 --> 00:42:02.565
but I am telling you tonight that those are the kinds

596
00:42:02.565 --> 00:42:05.325
of decisions that you walk straight up to the throne

597
00:42:05.345 --> 00:42:09.365
of heaven and you say, king Jesus, whatever you tell me

598
00:42:09.365 --> 00:42:11.525
to do, that is what I'm going to do

599
00:42:11.525 --> 00:42:14.805
because I live for you alone.

600
00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:21.495
I mentioned Clayton this morning, my only living child,

601
00:42:22.715 --> 00:42:24.815
and I mentioned to you that he got sick

602
00:42:26.595 --> 00:42:28.335
before he got sick, though

603
00:42:29.195 --> 00:42:31.855
he was going on international mission trips

604
00:42:32.595 --> 00:42:34.695
and any group that wanted to go somewhere,

605
00:42:34.795 --> 00:42:37.215
his tendency would just be to jump on the plane.

606
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:41.415
But for some strange reason, he had a proclivity to go

607
00:42:41.415 --> 00:42:43.535
to those places that are dangerous, places

608
00:42:44.065 --> 00:42:46.215
where they can cut your head off for your faith.

609
00:42:47.595 --> 00:42:51.315
I was out at DFW airport more than once, looking down

610
00:42:51.315 --> 00:42:56.155
that concourse just to make sure that my son had made it on

611
00:42:56.155 --> 00:42:57.755
that particular flight home.

612
00:42:59.535 --> 00:43:02.985
Clayton is better than he was in bed for 10 years.

613
00:43:03.415 --> 00:43:07.505
He's improving. Let me tell you what's about to happen.

614
00:43:07.855 --> 00:43:10.745
This is not supposition. I mean, it could be this week.

615
00:43:11.685 --> 00:43:16.425
What's about to happen is Clayton is going to improve enough

616
00:43:17.715 --> 00:43:19.085
that he's gonna come to me

617
00:43:19.145 --> 00:43:22.485
and he's gonna say, Hey dad, there's a group going

618
00:43:22.505 --> 00:43:23.765
to a certain certain place.

619
00:43:23.925 --> 00:43:27.125
I feel like I'm well enough. I'm gonna go with them.

620
00:43:28.035 --> 00:43:30.645
What am I supposed to say in that moment?

621
00:43:32.555 --> 00:43:35.935
Am I supposed to say, would you please

622
00:43:36.445 --> 00:43:38.055
stay here where it's safe?

623
00:43:39.025 --> 00:43:40.695
Would you please stay here

624
00:43:40.835 --> 00:43:44.335
and see if we can find enough health for you to get married

625
00:43:44.435 --> 00:43:45.895
and have grandchildren?

626
00:43:46.275 --> 00:43:51.055
For me, am I supposed to say, Clayton, could you stay here?

627
00:43:51.355 --> 00:43:55.575
I'm I'm not young and I would love for you to be close by.

628
00:43:57.035 --> 00:43:59.965
When I'm in hospice, what am I supposed

629
00:43:59.965 --> 00:44:03.395
to say, my friend?

630
00:44:04.755 --> 00:44:08.195
I am not gonna stop my son from going even

631
00:44:08.295 --> 00:44:12.835
to a dangerous place, even if his body comes home in a box.

632
00:44:13.095 --> 00:44:14.715
I'm not stopping him. Why?

633
00:44:15.425 --> 00:44:19.355
There's a logical reason why I would not stop him.

634
00:44:20.185 --> 00:44:21.235
Clayton Allen.

635
00:44:21.385 --> 00:44:25.635
Ross is on earth for the glory of God.

636
00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:28.115
That is why he exists.

637
00:44:28.705 --> 00:44:31.965
Therefore, if he exists for the glory of God,

638
00:44:32.065 --> 00:44:36.165
and in this particular instance, Jesus is glorified

639
00:44:36.265 --> 00:44:38.525
by the death of a martyr in a mission field,

640
00:44:39.185 --> 00:44:44.165
how can Dad say anything different from go Now tonight,

641
00:44:44.235 --> 00:44:47.125
Clayton and Richard are really not the issue tonight.

642
00:44:47.225 --> 00:44:51.725
The issue is every one of these children, every one

643
00:44:51.725 --> 00:44:55.645
of these teenagers, they are all on earth

644
00:44:56.225 --> 00:44:58.285
for the glory of God.

645
00:44:58.795 --> 00:45:01.415
Therefore, parents,

646
00:45:02.705 --> 00:45:05.695
there is no part of parenting

647
00:45:06.725 --> 00:45:10.815
that is more important than you parenting in those

648
00:45:11.415 --> 00:45:15.615
specific ways where you are making it most likely

649
00:45:16.285 --> 00:45:17.455
that your sons

650
00:45:17.455 --> 00:45:20.935
and daughters will live all of their adult lives

651
00:45:21.155 --> 00:45:23.535
for the glory of God.

652
00:45:27.555 --> 00:45:29.865
Would you just bow your heads, bow your heads,

653
00:45:36.215 --> 00:45:41.045
Lord Jesus, I know

654
00:45:41.235 --> 00:45:45.325
this room is filled with people that love you

655
00:45:46.065 --> 00:45:47.325
and want to see your kingdom.

656
00:45:47.395 --> 00:45:48.525
Come on this earth serve.

657
00:45:50.965 --> 00:45:55.715
We've got precious grandparents, precious single adults,

658
00:45:57.595 --> 00:46:00.815
all kinds of people that want to see the next generation

659
00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:02.815
run hard after you.

660
00:46:04.615 --> 00:46:06.745
Lord Jesus, would you teach us from your word?

661
00:46:06.745 --> 00:46:09.185
Would you teach us by the power of the Holy Spirit,

662
00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:15.605
how we join you in lifting the eyes of preschoolers

663
00:46:15.625 --> 00:46:18.965
and grade schoolers and teenagers to the glory of Jesus?

664
00:46:20.985 --> 00:46:24.695
Would you give moms and dads such a love

665
00:46:24.795 --> 00:46:28.585
and a passion for you that it would just splash

666
00:46:29.205 --> 00:46:32.655
all over those in their homes?

667
00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:36.945
Lord Jesus, we don't want to lose a one

668
00:46:37.205 --> 00:46:38.665
to the church in the Christian life.

669
00:46:38.725 --> 00:46:41.385
We don't wanna lose half. We don't wanna lose one.

670
00:46:42.335 --> 00:46:44.385
Lord Jesus, I'm praying blessings.

671
00:46:44.605 --> 00:46:46.945
I'm praying favor on this church

672
00:46:48.085 --> 00:46:51.025
as it launches out in this brand new direction

673
00:46:52.255 --> 00:46:53.835
to come alongside families,

674
00:46:53.935 --> 00:46:57.115
to see a generation change the world for your glory.

675
00:46:57.895 --> 00:47:01.675
And it is to that end that we dedicate ourselves tonight.

676
00:47:03.225 --> 00:47:04.225
Amen.

677
00:47:05.925 --> 00:47:07.705
Can we thank, uh, Dr. Richard Ross?

678
00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:16.425
Thank you. He'll be, he'll be coming again to help us

679
00:47:16.425 --> 00:47:18.105
through an exercise that I think you're gonna

680
00:47:18.105 --> 00:47:19.185
find just transformative.

681
00:47:20.005 --> 00:47:22.185
Uh, but before he does that, if you're not sitting

682
00:47:22.255 --> 00:47:23.865
with your parents, this is gonna be

683
00:47:23.865 --> 00:47:25.025
really important that you are.

684
00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:26.865
So if you're sitting away from your parents,

685
00:47:27.445 --> 00:47:29.025
I'm gonna give you opportunities and,

686
00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:30.405
and permission to stand up right now

687
00:47:30.405 --> 00:47:31.565
and just make your way to your parents.

688
00:47:32.185 --> 00:47:34.165
And, uh, and then I wanna say something else.

689
00:47:34.345 --> 00:47:37.485
Uh, this booklet right here, we've prepared 500 of them,

690
00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:39.005
so there's enough for everybody.

691
00:47:39.115 --> 00:47:43.005
This is kind of our, um, operator's manual

692
00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:45.045
for Family Discipleship.

693
00:47:45.545 --> 00:47:48.165
Uh, family Discipleship will not be a series

694
00:47:48.185 --> 00:47:50.445
of events like the one you're experiencing tonight.

695
00:47:50.625 --> 00:47:53.565
Family Discipleship occurs primarily off campus

696
00:47:53.995 --> 00:47:55.725
with no staff persons involved.

697
00:47:56.345 --> 00:47:58.525
And so, uh, if you don't know what that means,

698
00:47:58.735 --> 00:47:59.845
we'll have some training,

699
00:47:59.935 --> 00:48:02.885
we'll have some encouragement along the way, um,

700
00:48:02.945 --> 00:48:05.725
but, uh, it's, it's going to be trial and error.

701
00:48:05.955 --> 00:48:08.045
What we've discovered about family ministry is

702
00:48:08.045 --> 00:48:09.565
that there's no cookie cutter approach.

703
00:48:09.835 --> 00:48:11.845
Some of you have preschoolers, some

704
00:48:11.845 --> 00:48:14.125
of you have elementary schools, some of you have pre-teens,

705
00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:16.565
some of you have teens, some of you have, uh, grown parents.

706
00:48:16.785 --> 00:48:19.405
I'm, I'm, I mean, my, my kids are here

707
00:48:19.405 --> 00:48:20.845
with their kids, so I'm a grandparent.

708
00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:23.685
So there's no cookie cutter simple way

709
00:48:23.685 --> 00:48:24.925
to tell you how to do this.

710
00:48:25.625 --> 00:48:28.085
But, uh, like, uh, Richard Ross said is

711
00:48:28.085 --> 00:48:32.485
that you become a disciple and you glorify God in your life.

712
00:48:32.625 --> 00:48:35.365
And the spiritual conversations just come naturally.

713
00:48:35.615 --> 00:48:37.605
We'll train you how to do this, but, um,

714
00:48:38.465 --> 00:48:40.485
but it, it's going to require a commitment.

715
00:48:40.485 --> 00:48:43.365
And that's why we enter now into this commitment service.

716
00:48:43.885 --> 00:48:45.885
I wanna say something really quickly to grandparents.

717
00:48:46.265 --> 00:48:49.645
Um, I'm sorry that your kids aren't, uh,

718
00:48:49.855 --> 00:48:51.125
elementary school anymore,

719
00:48:51.625 --> 00:48:54.365
but the goal is to grow them up and to send them off.

720
00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:57.565
Uh, it's not an easy thing to do when you send them off.

721
00:48:57.945 --> 00:49:01.325
Um, somebody I'm very close to, uh,

722
00:49:01.355 --> 00:49:04.965
just dropped their daughter off to, uh, OU last year.

723
00:49:05.265 --> 00:49:07.245
And, uh, it was not easy for her.

724
00:49:07.385 --> 00:49:09.445
In fact, I couldn't really mention it without tears.

725
00:49:10.105 --> 00:49:12.765
So it's not an easy thing. But, but here's the issue.

726
00:49:13.545 --> 00:49:18.525
Uh, we have 18 years, I dunno how many months

727
00:49:18.545 --> 00:49:22.605
or weeks that is, but we have an opportunity to seize the o

728
00:49:22.985 --> 00:49:24.925
to seize that day, to begin to,

729
00:49:25.185 --> 00:49:26.725
to make this spiritual influence.

730
00:49:26.745 --> 00:49:28.965
And so it's going to require a commitment,

731
00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:30.445
it's gonna require dedication.

732
00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:32.005
And so, um,

733
00:49:32.625 --> 00:49:35.805
Dr. Ross has done this all over the United States over 500

734
00:49:35.805 --> 00:49:39.045
times, and he's going to lead us and a parent dedication.

735
00:49:39.065 --> 00:49:41.445
If you're a single parent, if you're a grandparent,

736
00:49:41.705 --> 00:49:43.485
if you don't have your kids here, uh,

737
00:49:43.705 --> 00:49:45.405
you might find someone near you.

738
00:49:45.465 --> 00:49:47.365
And, and let's spend this time in prayer too,

739
00:49:47.365 --> 00:49:49.045
as these parents and, and these kids

740
00:49:49.045 --> 00:49:50.165
are making commitments to one another.

741
00:49:50.165 --> 00:49:51.365
Let's spend this time in prayer

742
00:49:51.705 --> 00:49:54.125
and let's consecrate this church to becoming

743
00:49:54.685 --> 00:49:56.045
a family Discipleship Church.

744
00:49:56.145 --> 00:49:57.245
Dr. Rot, we complete us.
