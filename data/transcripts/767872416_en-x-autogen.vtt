1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.100
All right. Can you hear? Okay good.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.700
All right. Well, I want to say thank you. First of all for allowing me

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.400
to be absent last week. We had a

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.800
very peaceful home going of my father-in-law and

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.500
he was a believer in Jesus and I had

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.300
an opportunity in 2010 to talk with him

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.200
through the concept of security in

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.700
Salvation. And he said

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.100
he was involved in a religious

10
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.200
experience where he believed that you could

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.300
lose your salvation and I was able to show him in Scripture

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
that that that's really kind of out of our hands that

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.000
God is able to save us completely forever

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.600
and there's nothing we do to deserve

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.500
it and there's nothing we can do to out earn it

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.700
and we don't earn it at all. So anyway, so

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.900
I know he was a Believer and we had a great service. I'll

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.100
tell you a funny I didn't see this

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.500
coming. But while we were sitting with the family, it's

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.200
a very trepidation experience

21
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.800
to be the

22
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.400
Efficient of the service and the

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.300
son-in-law simultaneously and so we're

24
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.400
planting the service and right at the end we find out from his

25
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.100
new wife.

26
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.400
That they would go to the Opry on Friday nights

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.000
and seeing uh Bluegrass and

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.000
southern gospel music and and they

29
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.200
they would always finish with I'll Fly

30
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.000
Away, you know some glad morning. And so and then

31
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.400
what really moved me is that they would

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200
sing it together as a couple on the way to the car or the

33
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.900
parking lot. So I said don't you think it would be good if we

34
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.200
sang that to finish his service on Saturday and

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500
she said like yeah, that'd be great. And then

36
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100
it hits me. I've I don't lead music.

37
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.300
This could go really poorly and what a

38
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.200
way to ruin a great service but what you

39
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.100
didn't know is that a lot of people from the Opry were there and a lot

40
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.100
of folks from the Church of Christ were there and so we crushed

41
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.200
all fly away. I wanted to sing

42
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
second verse but didn't do it. So anyway, but thank

43
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.300
you for allowing me to be gone and thank you Pastor John

44
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.800
for coming and serving. Well, we're in chapter 10 this week and

45
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.100
we're going to since we got

46
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.400
started a little bit late. We're gonna forgo the pathway, of course,

47
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.700
you know the pathways that we're always in movement.

48
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.900
We're not satisfied with worship alone. Of

49
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.800
course, we worship it's a command of God a

50
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.500
mandate we obey but we also want to be involved in

51
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.300
the community group and open group where there's Bible study

52
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300
and just bible discussion. But what we're learning is

53
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.600
that the most optimal place the space for

54
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.500
most successful and fruitful disciple making

55
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
is in a micro group because it's a gender specific

56
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.000
and we maintain

57
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.000
A size last week you may

58
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.200
have discussed. I'm not sure since it

59
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.800
wasn't here. You may have discussed the optimal experience

60
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.300
of the micro group and how it might be different

61
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.100
from the

62
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.600
it's not going to work, but how it

63
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.400
might be different from one on one and

64
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.600
both are an excellent way of making disciples,

65
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600
but we

66
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.400
We believe that the micro group

67
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.700
or the D group is optimal because of attrition.

68
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.400
If one person can't be there in a

69
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.800
one-on-one relationship. That means the meeting is over and you

70
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.700
can actually have an absence and in

71
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.900
a micro group and then continue in the right direction. And

72
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900
so that's one reason why and then

73
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.400
another reason why is that I don't

74
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.300
want to I don't want anybody get discouraged because

75
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.400
I'm not okay our first night ten weeks

76
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.700
ago. We had 207 people. Okay, and here

77
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.500
we are 10 weeks later and with about half that

78
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.100
I think we're doing better than half tonight. And I want to say way to

79
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.200
go. Those are either been gone. No judgment glad to have you back. But

80
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.000
anyway attrition happens life

81
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.100
happens disciple making

82
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.600
is a command of God and so you can expect some spiritual

83
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.200
resistance from our

84
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.100
adversary and attrition happens, but this way these

85
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.700
are these groups

86
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.400
Are large enough to continue but small enough so that

87
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.300
we can we can check in on one another we can

88
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.000
know one another and we can sense where a

89
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.700
person is in their Spiritual Development

90
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.400
or formation. Okay, hopefully last week

91
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.800
John talked to you a little bit about the ecclesi Ecclesiastes pasties

92
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800
passage two are better than one.

93
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.700
And then also we ought we talked about the two

94
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.600
expectations the intentional leader right now.

95
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.900
Y'all pray for me. I'm working on an addition

96
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.200
to our church website that you can click on

97
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.900
a button saying I want to be a disciple maker and or

98
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.600
I want to join a disciple making

99
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.400
group and so in doing so we

100
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.800
can get your name and get you matched up with someone but an

101
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.600
intentional leader is responsible for Gathering

102
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.300
their own group, and I've been asking you to pray diligently

103
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.900
about who would I ask to

104
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.400
be in my micro group because you're going to invest your

105
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.600
life and you're gonna spend time should be someone that you you

106
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.100
love and someone that you know, and someone that you

107
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.700
are excited about spending time going deeper with and

108
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.400
so hopefully you're doing that but

109
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.300
one of the things that an intentional leader does is model

110
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.100
scriptural engagement. All

111
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.200
right each disciple in the micro.

112
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.800
Was going to be learning biblical content and

113
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.300
responding to that content in a

114
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.000
group but it's more than information. It's transformation. That

115
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.700
means is is that we're going to challenge one

116
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.400
another in a micro group to be studying the same

117
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.200
content. Maybe we'll talk

118
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.100
about curriculum in a minute maybe a curriculum that you've

119
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.600
decided on but maybe just a book of the Bible depending on

120
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.200
the makeup of your group and you'll be studying it

121
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.800
together once a week, but you'll be studying individually

122
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.200
daily. And what we're trying to do

123
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.700
is establish a regular repeated a

124
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.400
habit of scriptural engagement

125
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.200
more than just Bible reading but Bible engagement.

126
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.300
What does this say? What did

127
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.200
it say to the original hearers? What does it say about God? What does

128
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.200
it say about me? How should I respond?

129
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.600
Into it to what it is saying and so it's an

130
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.500
engagement issue where each disciple knows

131
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.000
that we are here for my spiritual growth

132
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.500
and in each disciple also

133
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.800
knows that when I grow to a certain point it

134
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.400
is the expectation that I will then become

135
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.500
the intentional leader and Lead my own group. So

136
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.200
the last week John talked about

137
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.200
how the intentional leader understands that curriculum is only

138
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.600
a tool.

139
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.100
Tools are only as good as

140
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.500
the person who knows how to use them.

141
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.800
All right, and some of you are very good at certain tools others

142
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.400
in the same room would say what is this thing? What

143
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.900
does it do? Right but once you've learned how to use it, I've done

144
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.300
something for you that I have no expectations as far

145
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.300
as what kind of curriculum you use but because

146
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.200
we didn't have anything like this. I went ahead and

147
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.700
engaged a nav press and that purchased 10

148
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.200
copies of growing in Christ. I've been through this

149
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.100
I don't know about a dozen times with brand new

150
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.000
Christians. Remember Carol when they were P Green and they had a

151
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.400
little squirrely Tree on the front. Anyway, this is

152
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.600
what it looks like. Now, it looks good, but it's

153
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.300
just the basics of disciple making

154
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.300
and I'm not expecting you

155
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.200
to buy your curriculum from the bookstore but I put them

156
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.100
in the bookstore so that you will know that it's available. You can look at it.

157
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.200
You can decide what you like and then you can order it online. So you don't

158
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.700
exhaust the bookstore. I bought 10 copies that's about two and

159
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.200
a half micro groups. All right. The other thing

160
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.600
that I bought was 10 copies of this two seven series. Also a

161
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.700
Navigator's curriculum has the book one book

162
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.700
two and book three again just covers

163
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.100
kind of the essentials of a brand new

164
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.600
Christian. So if you have a brand new Christian in your group, then you're probably

165
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.300
going to want to maybe use something that's going

166
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.800
to help them get started on the right on the right track. All

167
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:18.900
right.

168
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.300
And then intentional leaders model

169
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.100
expectations for transparency in your book

170
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.600
Jill Wagner has given you

171
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.100
one of these cards and this is going to be one of the most

172
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.600
important cards in your discipleship experience. Okay?

173
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.400
The reason is is that on one side is the

174
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.600
micro group Covenant and I would suggest

175
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.800
that once you have your micro group identified,

176
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.200
whether it's three or four people that you look at

177
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.000
this Covenant together and you seriously go over each line so

178
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.200
that they can know what is expected of

179
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.500
them. What's going to be expected of them and then you can sign it

180
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.100
in front of one another and date it and then you're not

181
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.800
turning it into me. There's no micro group

182
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.000
Covenant Police Department. All right,

183
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.200
this is just you Covenant with one another that we

184
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.400
are going to study God's word together. We're gonna go deeper together.

185
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.500
We expect to pray for one another we're

186
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.500
going to be involved in the scriptures together. You'll see

187
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.400
what things are in the Covenant but on the other side is

188
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.000
this we've not spent a lot of time on this, but I

189
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.000
wanted to give you a copy of it. These are really helpful guidelines

190
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.500
for every micro group and what

191
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.400
that means. Is that what you will learn

192
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.500
as you read this is that some of

193
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.300
In this room on Wednesday night have stepped outside

194
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.100
the guidelines. Okay, for example, let's

195
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.300
just look at number one a confidentiality.

196
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.700
Now was said in the group stays in the group and hopefully

197
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.100
no one's experienced a brief breach of confidentiality. But

198
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.900
here's a two important ones pause and

199
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.600
silence.

200
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.600
We have agreed that the holy spirit is the teacher. And so

201
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.400
if you ask a good question, and then

202
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.100
you wait for a response, it's okay to have

203
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.100
a moment of silence.

204
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.500
Even better is when a person is sharing and

205
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.800
they get to a point where they may have arrived at

206
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.500
a painful experience or a convicting

207
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.500
experience and they stop as a result of their emotional

208
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.400
condition. It's okay

209
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.500
to sit there and wait.

210
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.500
What a lot of leaders will do and myself included is I'm

211
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.200
not uncomfortable with somebody being uncomfortable. So I'll just jump right

212
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.500
in there and say, oh I'm so sorry. You don't have to talk anymore or the

213
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.000
dreaded give them a clean X, you

214
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.200
know, like hair stop that crying, you know,

215
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.400
but we'll wait we'll pause we'll

216
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.400
listen because that's when the Holy Spirit does

217
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.400
some of his best work. Okay, what's another

218
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.300
no cross talk that means there's a

219
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.600
conversation going on. That's not the primary conversation

220
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.700
more than one conversation going on at once and then

221
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.900
no fixing or rescuing. That means

222
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.600
is that Jesus does the fixing what we're

223
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.100
just what we're doing is we're having scriptural conversations

224
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.400
letting the Holy Spirit do his work and

225
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.800
letting the Holy Spirit lead us to conclusions for transform

226
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.100
behavior. All right. This takes the

227
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.200
onus of responsibility of you being the

228
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.000
the the hierarchical know-it-all

229
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.900
Okay, you're not the the teacher that knows let

230
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.400
me tell you what you need to do on that now. That's that's not

231
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.500
what this opposite is.

232
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.300
And then this last one is what I wanted to get to sharing.

233
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.400
I'm gonna read it to you. Okay, because this is going to be one of your biggest problems as

234
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.300
a micro group be sensitive about the amount

235
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.300
of time you share.

236
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.200
Don't be offended. If the leader asks to hear from

237
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.400
others typically in every group. There's

238
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.500
one person who does not want to share at all.

239
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.700
And one person who does not know when to stop sharing.

240
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.300
Okay, and so as a micro group,

241
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.100
it's okay for you to say. Hey, I like to hear from

242
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.300
this guy about that or this gal about that or hey

243
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.200
at a

244
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.300
guy in one of my groups. That was just very very

245
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.200
verbose and he and I had a plan that when I

246
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.000
would click my watch like this.

247
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.400
That it meant that he was over it. It's

248
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.700
time for him to stop. Okay, and I had to do this almost the

249
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.100
whole meeting.

250
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.600
Because he loved discipleship and loved to have something to

251
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.000
say about discipleship. All right be self-aware how

252
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.400
you were affecting the environment with

253
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.800
your non-verbals people are busy. Sometimes

254
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.400
they look at their clock. Sometimes they tap

255
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.300
their clock. Sometimes they they have

256
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.300
to the check and see what's happening if

257
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.500
there's something happening in the room, but be self-aware that you're

258
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.600
nonverbals can shut somebody down. And then lastly

259
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.600
this is the one that I wanted to spend a little bit of time with is I

260
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.000
statements

261
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.200
Once I was walking through here on a

262
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.000
Wednesday night and someone said hey, can you explain to me what I statements mean?

263
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.600
We have a proclivity.

264
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:05.900
to

265
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.400
discuss things that are not about us

266
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.000
necessarily

267
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.000
Like you know what the problem with the church is.

268
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.100
Or you know what the problem with the culture is. The one thing about

269
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.400
the culture that I don't like is that we're not really here

270
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.400
to transform the church and we're not really here to transform the culture.

271
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.500
Who are we who am I here necessarily to transform?

272
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.800
me

273
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.000
so one of the one of the leaders best tools

274
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.500
is when a person says, you know what I

275
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.200
don't like about the church is this is to say

276
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.900
well, can you say that in the form of an eye statement?

277
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.800
And if they can't they shouldn't be saying it and

278
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.200
if they can then they get to become a part

279
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.200
of the transformation the solution for what's going

280
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.400
wrong.

281
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.200
All right, and it gets personal.

282
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.400
And it's supposed to get personal. It's supposed to be intimate that

283
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.000
way and so practice I statements intentional leaders

284
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.600
ask for eye statements. All

285
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.700
right, let's get to tonight's content and let me

286
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.000
just tell you.

287
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.300
I saw it coming. This is

288
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.400
probably the hardest hurdle for us to

289
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.400
to navigate and that is making the

290
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.700
most of your time. How do I find time to

291
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.700
make disciples only 24 hours in

292
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:24.900
a day.

293
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.500
You have to spend some of that time eating sleeping working

294
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.300
relating in

295
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.400
your family and doing the things that you like to do. And so

296
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.400
what I'm telling you today is that

297
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.300
when you're trying to find time disciple making isn't

298
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.700
something that you do if you have extra time.

299
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.400
Because your adversary understands the

300
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.700
power of discipleship and he'll make sure you never have

301
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.800
any extra time.

302
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.200
Okay, we're on page four here of your

303
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.500
handout. We must make disciple making

304
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.500
a priority. That's what Jesus did he

305
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.900
prioritized time and investing in his disciples. He

306
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.600
did have public Ministries with large crowd, but

307
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.600
he constantly demanded time with

308
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.300
disciples and so really quickly.

309
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.400
How do you do that? Will you take an inventory of your time and you

310
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.100
do two things that you have to do and one is

311
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.300
a concentrate what that means

312
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.400
is is that you're going to concentrate on the things in your life that are the

313
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:25.800
most important.

314
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.200
And you're going to eliminate.

315
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.600
Things in your life that are not important.

316
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.100
All right. And you say well everything I

317
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.700
do is important. Well, I don't disagree with that. But you have to prioritize to

318
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.500
try to make time for discipleship and number

319
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.300
two is was revolutionary for me and that

320
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.400
is and this is on page five repurpose the time you already

321
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.300
have here's a conversation did you eat

322
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:50.500
today?

323
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.000
Yes.

324
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.100
How many times did you eat today? That's three times others would

325
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.700
say two others would say six, but it's

326
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.500
multiple times a day. All right, you ate breakfast

327
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.600
lunch and dinner. Yes.

328
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.100
So if you eat three times a day, then you have

329
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.100
at least three opportunities a day to make disciples.

330
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.100
Why not? This is a great question. What if you

331
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.400
took just one meal each week?

332
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.700
one meal out of 21 meal times in a

333
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:21.700
week

334
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.400
and gave it to the Lord for the purpose of sharing a meal

335
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.300
and making disciples.

336
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.900
That's what I have been most effective.

337
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.800
During the week early a

338
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.600
one group met at six.

339
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.500
That's even that's even earlier than 6:30, but you

340
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.900
can't meet months meet much later than 6:30, because guys and

341
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.200
ladies have got to get a work at 7:30. If you

342
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200
have retirees in your group, then you can

343
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.800
meet at a different pace and a different Leisure, but why not

344
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.600
get up early and decide somewhere

345
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.600
where you can meet that's going to be calm a relational environment

346
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.900
and and share meat meal

347
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.000
together Donuts. I don't

348
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.700
eat donuts.

349
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.700
But they're cheap.

350
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.200
And if somebody says I can't eat that. I mean I

351
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.600
can't meet then I'm having breakfast then. Oh, I'll bring breakfast.

352
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.500
Right, so just share that time together

353
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.400
for the purpose of making disciples repurpose the

354
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.500
time you have for making disciples and then the last

355
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.900
two of these make an appointment.

356
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.000
All of you as mature adults

357
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.300
know what it means to make time for

358
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.300
things that are important. All right, if I have a

359
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.000
heart condition and I have an appointment with the cardiologist. I'm

360
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.500
going to say I didn't have time to go today.

361
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.200
No, it's my heart. I gotta go. That's the

362
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.800
cardiologist right? It's important. Well, if

363
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.400
disciple making is important, then you have

364
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.800
to purpose in your heart to set an appointment with those

365
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.700
in your micro group. All right, make it

366
00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.400
the first appointment for that day schedule that

367
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.600
appointment each week prioritize it car of

368
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.500
time out for it and and keep the the disciple

369
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.600
making appointment and also be flexible and creative.

370
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.300
That means is that when you meet together with

371
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.300
your micro group, you may discover that the time that you thought was

372
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.800
going to work is not going to work. And so you may have to be flexible.

373
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.000
I think I told you when I

374
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.100
was in seventh or

375
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.400
8th grade.

376
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.600
My minister of Youth came to me and asked me to pray about something about being

377
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.600
in this opship group. And so there was

378
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.100
more than a micro group there was about seven of us and and

379
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.100
there was no time during the

380
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.300
week that we could meet but we all discovered that we could meet

381
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.200
at seven am on Saturday morning.

382
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.400
And that is the last thing that

383
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.100
11 year old boy wants to be doing is getting up and going to

384
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.800
church on Saturday, too.

385
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.800
I knew I was coming on Sunday.

386
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.100
But guess what for six solid years

387
00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.000
we met on Saturday morning.

388
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.600
And that's when I memorized most of the scripture that I have memorized and

389
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.200
that's when I fell in love with Jesus and learned how to have a Bible

390
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.600
engagement every day and it and

391
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.200
frankly. It's probably the reason

392
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.300
I'm standing before you today.

393
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.500
Is that I believe in this because I made

394
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.300
time for this and my minister

395
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.200
of Youth was creative enough to say

396
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.400
I'll give up a Saturday morning to meet with a group of boys who need

397
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.100
to see Jesus and to turn into Jesus. All right.

398
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.300
Really quickly. Jesus was our model.

399
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.000
Jesus had a micro group. Did you know this?

400
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.600
Peter James and John were his quad

401
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.000
his micro group. He asked

402
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.700
specifically for those three alone.

403
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.500
To be with him during the raising of jarius's daughter.

404
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.900
This is a

405
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.200
Page six also during the Transfiguration of

406
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.600
Jesus. I'm not

407
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.700
going to spend a lot of time on this but I love that that passage where

408
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.700
you know, Jesus is transfigured there

409
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.600
with Moses Elijah and Peter because he's a

410
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.300
disciple and stuff will make her goes. Hey, let's start a building

411
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.200
program and build a building. You know, he must have been a Baptist

412
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.200
don't you think and and Jesus is like

413
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.000
There's something else going on here.

414
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.700
You know, he also asked

415
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.200
them to be with him in a special way during

416
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.100
the his time in the Garden of Gethsemane. So I

417
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.300
don't know the answer to these questions, but these

418
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.300
are great questions. Maybe you can spend some time on

419
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.500
these questions in your micro group tonight. What conclusions can

420
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.600
be drawn for the reasons that Jesus had a micro

421
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.300
group? Why did he choose a circle of three

422
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.800
and himself to experience these things?

423
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.300
Why did Jesus arrange for intimate moments

424
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.100
in Ministry?

425
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.300
Why did he win his micro group to witness his power over

426
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:54.800
death?

427
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.700
Or to observe his glory revealed.

428
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.100
Why did Jesus want his micro group to share in the

429
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.000
anguish and submission in his submission of the will of

430
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.600
the father and Garden of Gethsemane?

431
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.700
I don't know the answer to this but I

432
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.800
do know this that all three of those men Peter

433
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.600
James and John had powerful leadership experiences in

434
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.500
the New Testament Church. You can read about it in Acts. You can

435
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.300
read about it in first and second Peter. You can read about it in

436
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.600
John in Revelation. You can read about it. All through James was

437
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.300
the the leader of the Jewish Church in Jerusalem Post

438
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.100
Resurrection. So all of these

439
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.600
men became major players in the establishment of

440
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.600
the early church, and I don't think it's an accident that Jesus

441
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.200
had them as a part of his micro group, okay.

442
00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:40.500
All right.

443
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.700
What are we going to do next will we're gonna

444
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.400
meet in our micro groups. I'm I know there are

445
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.100
two brand new people here tonight, and I'm trying

446
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.400
to find where you are and I cannot so in a minute when we break into

447
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.600
our micro groups, if you're new and you want me to help you find one and

448
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.500
come meet with me down here and I'll get you I'll get

449
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.100
you hooked up with a micro group. Okay, let's pray together and then

450
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:02.600
we'll break up.

451
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.900
Father thank you so much for something as important as

452
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.300
disciple making thank you for allowing me

453
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.300
to serve on a church. That's made disciple making a

454
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.300
high priority Lord. Give me the wisdom to

455
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.500
know how to inspire these people to be involved in

456
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.300
something that we life-changing for eternity

457
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.700
and it's in Jesus name. I pray amen.
