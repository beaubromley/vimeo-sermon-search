1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.200
For the grace of God offers salvation

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.800
to all people teaching us

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.100
to live Godly life.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us and to

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
purify for himself a people that

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.600
are his very own.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.200
So as I said earlier any true movement of

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.300
God will be directly tied to his Spirit working through

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.800
his word.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.400
It's not just emotionalism. It's not just some

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.200
manipulation it is that and so

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.000
I want to spend some time.

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.700
Explaining some scripture to us.

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.100
From God's word. It's gonna lead us to see God

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.900
rightly and see ourselves in light of it.

16
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.300
Which we've been praying it leads to both Brokenness and

17
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.100
repentance and encouragement that we

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.700
can pursue him.

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
As you'll see in God set this all up.

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.900
with a really interesting Passage

21
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.700
as we continue through our Series in Titus a text

22
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.500
of scripture that deals directly with sin and our

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.200
response.

24
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
And so if you're not there already go ahead and turn to Titus

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.600
Chapter 3 with me in God's

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
word Titus 3.

27
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.400
We are almost to the end of Titus. In fact next Sunday will

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.500
be the last sermon in this series of

29
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.600
Titus.

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.100
in case you know need to know that but

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.600
Before we get into the text today. I want to make something abundantly

32
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.900
clear.

33
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.600
The subject we're talking about today, which many people

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.400
commonly refer to as church discipline.

35
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.600
It this is never meant to be punitive.

36
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.400
Never meant to be vindictive.

37
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.000
Never meant to be used as a club.

38
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.600
to beat someone up with

39
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.200
the goal in all this is not to kick people out of the church.

40
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
That's what it's been characterized as before the goal actually.

41
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.200
Now you see how all this ties together as we go through this the goal

42
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200
is actually holiness.

43
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.600
The goal is Godly living.

44
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.500
for his church

45
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.400
The goal is Imaging Jesus to the world around us.

46
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.800
That's why what we're going to talk about today is actually a

47
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.300
good thing.

48
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.400
And it's a good thing for all of us because I'm

49
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.900
not perfect.

50
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.500
The elders aren't perfect. You're not perfect.

51
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
And so we are all going to need correction at some

52
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.800
point, right?

53
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.100
We're all going to need accountability. We're all going to need

54
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.300
help toward living. The life. God has called us to live we

55
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.400
need each other in this journey, and I hope that

56
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.900
if you might have been wounded by something like this before.

57
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.100
And what you'll hear today is healing.

58
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.300
is

59
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.700
finding healing in as we look at what God actually says

60
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.300
and how we are to handle it that you find some measure

61
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.600
of Grace here.

62
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.500
What God really says so Titus 3 verses 9 through

63
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.700
11.

64
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.300
But avoid foolish controversies genealogies dissensions

65
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.700
and corals about the law.

66
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.900
For they are unprofitable and worthless.

67
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.200
as for a person who stirs up division

68
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.200
after warning him once and then twice have nothing more

69
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.000
to do with him.

70
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.900
Knowing that such a person is Warped and sinful.

71
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.000
He is self condemned.

72
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.600
God we need you as we've already said

73
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.400
over and over today. We need you.

74
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.700
To open our hearts and our minds to soften

75
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.300
our hearts to see and hear what you want us to see and

76
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.600
hear today.

77
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.800
Lead us.

78
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.900
Change us.

79
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.000
For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray

80
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.700
amen

81
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.300
Now if you remember back in titus's day on the island of

82
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.400
Crete there were false teachers trying to disrupt the

83
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.800
new church.

84
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.900
Bringing in all these false ideas disrupting the

85
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.300
gospel heresy things that didn't match

86
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.800
with God's word. And so so we already saw in

87
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.200
chapter one how Titus was to deal with them how he

88
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.300
was supposed to handle them and here he's just kind of repeating it

89
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.300
in a little bit different form. But what we see here

90
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.000
is it takes it actually a level deeper.

91
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.300
To those who might merely be caught up in all

92
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.500
that Ruckus.

93
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.500
That not only the false teachers, but now people within

94
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.500
the church were causing division as a result.

95
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.300
Or maybe they're they're causing other types of Divisions. We

96
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.400
don't know about but it's just that point of verse 10

97
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.700
as for a person who stirs that's that can

98
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.500
be any of us, right?

99
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.000
That's why we need one another.

100
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.000
To be a check in any drift in our

101
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.500
lives.

102
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.600
To guard one another from slipping into error wherever we might slip

103
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.400
into that to help keep one another from being known

104
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.300
as one who's stirring up division or or causing trouble

105
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.500
or being known as a sinful person. We don't want anyone

106
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.200
to be there.

107
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.000
but the reality is

108
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.200
the old man can reappear in a church.

109
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.100
The old man can reappear in a

110
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.300
church again. I'm not talking about age. We talked about this last week in

111
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.700
verse 3 that the old man is a description of the flesh

112
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.700
being in control of your life.

113
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.400
That's the old man we've talked

114
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.300
about and you see a contrast in verses 1

115
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.300
through 3 here of the new man that we're

116
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.000
supposed to be in Christ. But also the old man is explained versus

117
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.000
one through three says remind them to be

118
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.000
submissive to rulers authorities. Be obedient be

119
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.100
ready for every good work to speak

120
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.100
evil of no one avoid quarreling be gentle show perfect

121
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.500
courtesy toward all people. That's the new

122
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.300
man verse 3 for we ourselves were

123
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.200
once foolish.

124
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.300
disobedient LED astray

125
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.500
slaves to various passions and Pleasures passing our days and Malice

126
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.400
and envy hated by others hating one another. That's

127
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.600
the old man.

128
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.800
But that is why we get what we get in the passage today,

129
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.100
right that someone who's led by the flesh the

130
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.100
old man instead of submission to

131
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.800
Authority you get Disobedience dissension

132
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.600
and divisions.

133
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.200
Because what was happening back then is that these people love to

134
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200
stir up trouble. They were they were talking and debating about

135
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.800
foolish discussions spiritual pedigrees. They

136
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.600
were talking about who was more more faithful

137
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.300
closer to God based on your family lineage.

138
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.300
Like we're more Jewish than you are even though we're Christians.

139
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.700
We're still closer to God.

140
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.000
debates and discussions divisions

141
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.300
and you saw in chapter three verses 1 and

142
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.800
2 you're supposed to avoid coraling and you're not quarrel

143
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.100
somebody instead of that as the old man is in charge you get foolish controversies.

144
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.300
You get rampant fighting about back. Then the

145
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.600
tiny nuances of Jewish law and nitpicking where

146
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.300
somebody was just one degree off and and you're off and

147
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.500
you're out and and it was debating less important

148
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.800
issues. And that's what they loved.

149
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600
They love the drama.

150
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.700
That they saw whenever they stirred stuff up.

151
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.500
They fed off of it.

152
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.600
And so instead of the new life in Christ, where where you're

153
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.400
to be stunned by the gospel ready for good

154
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.500
works. These people were living like the old

155
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.900
man.

156
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.200
Verses 9 through 11 is a picture again of what the

157
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.000
old man looks like.

158
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.400
And that was happening because verse 3 said they were LED astray.

159
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.400
The way verse 11 says it they were in sin. They were

160
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.100
warped.

161
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.600
Not like Mario gets warped like it was warped in

162
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.900
the sense that word means off track like someone on

163
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.500
a train and trains derailing and running off

164
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.800
down into the valley. That's what's happened to these people.

165
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.800
They've been LED astray.

166
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.200
And before you think this was only a problem 2,000 years ago

167
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.600
in pre-increte.

168
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.500
These same kinds of divisive problems show

169
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.600
up regularly in churches even today.

170
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.500
I heard just a couple weeks ago of a church in Oklahoma that is

171
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.300
splitting because the pastor's wife was berating women

172
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.900
who worked outside the home.

173
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.800
That their blaspheming God somehow.

174
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.200
or think of how some Churches may not ever say it

175
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.400
out loud, but sure act like one ethnicity is more

176
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.200
valuable to God than any other ethnicity is

177
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.600
or think of how quickly

178
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.200
divisions happen over preferences in a

179
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.600
church

180
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.500
Whether it's clothing choices or music style or

181
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.600
how active to be politically or not.

182
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.000
now

183
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.800
I want to be clear that there are some things we're going to fight for.

184
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.400
That we are going to stand on and and

185
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.500
hold fast to like the core elements of the Gospel

186
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.700
what God's word reveals as truth. There

187
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.200
are Hills worth dying on.

188
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.600
but in everything else

189
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.100
instead of fighting one another

190
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.100
we are to fight for Unity.

191
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.200
We are to hold Loosely what God's word holds this loosely?

192
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.400
And don't think that's impossible to walk in unity,

193
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.300
even with diverse and different opinions and all kinds of different things.

194
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.100
It's possible because remember Ephesians 2 describes Jews

195
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.200
and Gentiles were able to

196
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200
be in the church together.

197
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.400
The most opposite hated people were able to

198
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.700
be in the church together. If they could that means we most certainly

199
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:43.900
can.

200
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.900
But what it took for them?

201
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.700
to get to that

202
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.200
was what we refer to as higpuff.

203
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.200
Ephesians 4:2 is where that comes from higpuff humility gentleness,

204
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.400
patience and forbearance.

205
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.400
That's what it took for Jews and Gentiles to

206
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.200
be in the church together. It's the same thing for us eager to

207
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.000
maintain the unity of the spirit in the

208
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:13.800
bond of peace.

209
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.900
That's what it takes.

210
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.600
to walk in unity together

211
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.700
now in all this talk of unity divisions

212
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.200
I don't want you to walk away from this.

213
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.500
Thinking that you can never ask a question of leaders.

214
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.500
That you can never bring up an issue because you're going to be labeled as

215
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.100
a divisive person. That is not at all what we're talking about

216
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.700
because we know we're gonna make mistakes.

217
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.500
We know that you need Clarity on things that are happening. Yes, and

218
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.500
so come talk to us about it. Absolutely. We want to

219
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.300
talk about it what Titus 3:9

220
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.000
is talking about is a divisive spirit.

221
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.700
different right

222
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.400
where somebody is walking around teaching heresy in

223
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.500
active opposition to The Stance of God's word

224
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.500
and that's that's divisive Spirit or

225
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.500
or just fighting over trivial things.

226
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.400
Like my mom used to say it making a mountain out of a molehill anybody ever

227
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.000
heard that one before?

228
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.300
Right. It's a small it's not a big deal and you make

229
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.500
it this massive issue.

230
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.400
Here's why James 4:1 actually ties

231
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.200
it to the old man within us.

232
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.800
That flesh. That's still there says what causes corals and

233
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.200
fights among you is it not that

234
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.500
your passions are at War within you?

235
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.400
What is the passion that's the old man? That's the flesh

236
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.200
creeping back up and say no. No, you should

237
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.700
want this. This should be yours, and it's causing corals

238
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.100
and fights.

239
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.300
That was Paul's whole point in saying what he said to Titus here. He

240
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.400
says do these things to protect the

241
00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.700
church.

242
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.300
To protect the church to protect the church's Mission

243
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.600
because what the the Lost out there would see

244
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.900
in this church in Crete was unity

245
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.600
and they were like man that seems radical to

246
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.400
me. I want what you have but if they saw disunity they

247
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.100
saw factions and breaking it all apart. They would

248
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.900
look at it and say see you guys can't even get along.

249
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:23.800
Come on.

250
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.000
This is thing real.

251
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.700
So Paul was saying Titus protect the church Titus protect

252
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.700
the church's mission.

253
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.600
That's why we must lean toward Unity lean

254
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.800
toward togetherness.

255
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.200
Not purposely looking for ways to distinguish in

256
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.200
ways to divide.

257
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.100
fighting over this and that

258
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.100
leaving churches for trivial things.

259
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.700
Second Timothy 2:14 says quarrels like

260
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.500
that. It says ruins the hearers.

261
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.300
We can't forget what this is causing.

262
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.800
Now again, let me be clear. There are absolutely valid reasons

263
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.400
to leave a church.

264
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.000
Like if you start smelling heresy from the the pulpit, yeah.

265
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.200
If you see the lifestyles of the leadership not matching up

266
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.400
what Titus one said the qualifications should be yeah.

267
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.900
If no one is addressing sin in members' lives.

268
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:39.900
Yeah.

269
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.400
If no one is making effort as Leaders to care

270
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.100
for the flock and just say forget you they yeah, of course

271
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.300
and there's probably many more reasons.

272
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.800
But so much of what has triggered the Sheep

273
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.600
shuffling of our day has little

274
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.400
to do with those things and way more to do with preferences.

275
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.400
Or an unwillingness to do the hard

276
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.500
things like have conversations and come to an understanding

277
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.200
about something you're different over.

278
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.400
Or even just your apathy and

279
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.200
your lack of involvement and so you start to drift but you

280
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.800
blame the church.

281
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.300
Don't let bitterness creep into your heart

282
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.100
where you just start looking for problems.

283
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.600
Instead in the truth of God's word look

284
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.000
for ways to be Unified.

285
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.400
Look for ways to foster togetherness look for ways

286
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.600
to work together as one body because one

287
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.000
of the primary ways the enemy attacks any church is

288
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.700
when any of us let this old man

289
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.700
creep back in and have control.

290
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.300
That's when division happens.

291
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.400
You start looking out for number one instead of looking out for what God wants.

292
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.100
Titus was supposed to and we are supposed to Major on

293
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.100
the sound Doctrine from verse 1

294
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.600
remember that produces this Godly living. He tied

295
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.900
us was supposed to focus there.

296
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.000
Same with us.

297
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.000
Says that is excellent and profitable verse 8.

298
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.800
Not what here, it says these unprofitable worthless

299
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.300
things that just divide us.

300
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.500
So Paul says to Titus here's what you are to avoid.

301
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.200
in verse 9

302
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.200
But then he says here's what you do with it. Here's what you do with this

303
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.700
old man when he or she creeps back up in the church. What do

304
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.300
you do Titus you warn them?

305
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.200
Here's what you do Titus avoid it stay away

306
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.200
from it. Don't get caught up in that mess. But here's what you do when you see it.

307
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.100
You warn them.

308
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.400
Whether that false teachers proclaiming heresy you go

309
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.300
after that you warn them or if it's somebody who's

310
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.300
just caught up in sin and we'll see where we go with that how to get

311
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.700
caught up in sin. Yeah you are to warn that's what verse 10 says as

312
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.600
for a person who stirs up division after warning him

313
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.100
once and then twice have nothing more to do

314
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.500
with them.

315
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.700
Pretty straightforward, right?

316
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.300
Most commentators agree that what Paul's doing here is he's just

317
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.500
explaining and applying what Jesus said

318
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.500
back in Matthew 18.

319
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.900
This is what Jesus said in Matthew 18 verses 15

320
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.400
through 17. See if it starts to sound familiar. Now.

321
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.400
Jesus said if your brother sins against you

322
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.200
go and tell him his fault between you and him

323
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.600
alone if he listens to you you've gained your brother.

324
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.300
But if he does not listen take one or two, others along

325
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:57.800
with you.

326
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.300
That every charge may be established by the evidence of two or

327
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.800
three Witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them tell

328
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.100
it to the church. If you refuse to listen even to the

329
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.100
church let him be to you as a gentile and a

330
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.700
tax collector.

331
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.300
Sounds a lot like Titus 3, right?

332
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.600
Well, here's what's happened with this passage in Matthew 18, though.

333
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.400
Sadly it has been used to create some

334
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.300
rigid structure of coldly confronting sin.

335
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.400
Where it has seemed like the goal is to kick people

336
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.000
out of the church.

337
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.000
But does that smell like the

338
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.300
Redemptive Spirit of Jesus in any

339
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:45.300
way?

340
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600
especially

341
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.700
especially since right before this passage the Jesus tells a

342
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.600
parable of seeking the lost sheep.

343
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.100
And then right after this passage he talks about how many times you're supposed

344
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.800
to forgive somebody 70 times 7.

345
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.200
And sandwiched in between somehow we got into this thing.

346
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.200
Like we're gonna work through this really quickly and and we're gonna

347
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.400
be excited to go after somebody and call out their sin

348
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.500
and so we can get him out of the church.

349
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.900
It doesn't match right?

350
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.800
It's the spirit of the text. Is he saying no, like second Thessalonians

351
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.300
3:15. Do not regard him as an enemy

352
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.000
warn him as a brother.

353
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.600
Again, the whole point of this is good.

354
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.900
It's for our good.

355
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.500
Because the goal is that someone listens Matthew 18 says

356
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.500
that means they repent their relationship

357
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.100
is restored.

358
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.500
By the way, when we say the word repent around here, here's what

359
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:48.800
we mean.

360
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.400
Literally in the text means turning away from

361
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.500
something turning to something a change of mind.

362
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.100
We would just say it shorthand seeking to change.

363
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.300
When you hear the word repentance, it should not trigger. It

364
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.500
doesn't mean just saying you're sorry for what you did.

365
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.200
Right. That's that's just I'm sorry.

366
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.700
It's not repentance.

367
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.200
And that's it's not also just acknowledging that it happened.

368
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.400
Right. Yeah.

369
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.200
I did it.

370
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.100
It's also here this one.

371
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.200
It's also not just saying you're sorry for them

372
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200
feeling the way they do.

373
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:31.600
You got that?

374
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.000
I'm sorry, you feel that way.

375
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.400
That's not owning anything. Right? No when we say repentance.

376
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.300
We say I did that. I hate it.

377
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.400
I'm so sorry. I did it.

378
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.400
God help me change you help me change.

379
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.100
You see the difference?

380
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.500
Not just I'm sorry. Sorry you feel that way? Yeah, I

381
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.300
know that hurt.

382
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.400
that hurts that

383
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.600
I know I did. I'm sorry.

384
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.600
Can you help me change God help me change? I

385
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.400
don't want that anymore.

386
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.600
That's a whole different mindset when we

387
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.000
talk about Matthew 18 listening repentance.

388
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.300
In fact in Matthew 18. There's even a Step

389
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.100
Zero that Jesus assumes here, but we

390
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.000
we can't forget.

391
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.300
It's the conviction that God's spirit brings when

392
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.100
you're by yourself.

393
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.000
He jumps immediately too when somebody sends against you you go to

394
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.300
them that kind of thing. No, it's when you're by yourself and and think about that if

395
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.500
if God's spirit convicts you and it it ends it

396
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.300
right there. If you repent right God shows you

397
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.200
your own sin. You repent and nobody else even though you're done.

398
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.400
Because here's the thing. Listen if God's at work in

399
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.100
your life if his spirit is at work in your life.

400
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.600
He will not let you be comfortable with sin.

401
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.300
He won't let you continue on as if it's okay.

402
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.600
You're eventually going to start feeling what I felt for a

403
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.300
season in my time years ago.

404
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.300
What Psalm 32 verses three

405
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.300
and four describes?

406
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.500
It says when I kept silent my bones

407
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.400
wasted away.

408
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.700
Through my groaning all day long.

409
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.600
For day and night your hand. God was Heavy upon me.

410
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.400
My strength was dried up as by The Heat Of

411
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:39.900
Summer.

412
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.200
Not gonna ask you to raise your hand, but you you feel that before right?

413
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.900
So God's not going to let you be comfortable with sin.

414
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.800
But the reality is some of us get stuck at times, don't we?

415
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.300
We get stuck.

416
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.000
times of Shame

417
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.600
when we don't want

418
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.900
to get caught

419
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.700
we don't want to get exposed in what we're doing because we

420
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.100
know what that's going to do to reputation. There's no

421
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.000
I don't want to tell anybody because I know what's gonna come on the other side of it. And so

422
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.400
what we do is we stuff it in the closet of our hearts and and

423
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.600
we hope nobody finds out and we think and we deceive ourselves

424
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.200
that we can manage it and we can keep it back there

425
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.000
and we can make sure nobody gets hurt by it, but I can just keep it

426
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:30.600
here for a while.

427
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.400
That's why Jesus said what he said in Matthew 18.

428
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.100
Because at some point we are all going

429
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:42.900
to need.

430
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.300
Some help to walk out of the darkness into the light.

431
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.200
We can deceive ourselves, but we got to have somebody walking

432
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.100
into it.

433
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.400
with us

434
00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.800
Okay, so what do you do?

435
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.700
What do you do when your sin against?

436
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:03.600
or

437
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.300
Titus 3 what happens when somebody has a device of spirit you see

438
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.700
it? You notice it you understand it. What do you do?

439
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.200
Well first you go to them individually to warn them.

440
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.900
So what it says, right you warn them individually of

441
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.400
sins consequences if you continue this

442
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.600
track, here's what's

443
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.300
coming

444
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.400
It's what Jesus said tell him his fault between you and him

445
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:30.700
alone.

446
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.100
Hear me. This is not getting one of the pastors to

447
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:36.500
do it for you.

448
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.800
This is not getting your CG leader to do it for you.

449
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.300
Right. Hey, did you hear what he's doing? You need to go talk

450
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.900
to him about that? No, if you know you go.

451
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.900
If it's against you you go if if it's something you see happen

452
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.500
you go.

453
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.700
Now you don't go in a judgmental way.

454
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.800
You go in a humble and self-aware kind

455
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.200
of way like you're recognize your own failures too.

456
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.300
And you're going to them humbly in it. I love how Jesus said

457
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.300
this. This is one of the most profound images you can ever have in your mind.

458
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.300
The way Jesus said this is you take the log out

459
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.600
of your eye so you can help them with the speck of

460
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.500
dust in their eye.

461
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400
So just think about this.

462
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.700
He's saying don't walk around like

463
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.000
this.

464
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.400
And you're walking up to somebody and you're saying to

465
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.500
the hey, hey, I noticed you've got this this issue

466
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.000
that I had confronted and and and and

467
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.200
you you turn in smack him in the face with a log in your eye

468
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.300
and they're you're trying to talk to them. You can't even see to get

469
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.400
the speck out of there. That's what he's saying.

470
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.500
He's saying get this thing out of here so you can see clearly to

471
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:49.800
help them.

472
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.900
Don't walk around blinded by your own sin. Trying

473
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.200
to help somebody else with theirs.

474
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.300
No, you walk humbly. You acknowledge your

475
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.200
own sin that you could get there to Galatians 6

476
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.300
says it. Well, if anyone's caught in any transgression you who

477
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.600
are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness,

478
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.600
but keep watch on yourself lest you

479
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.200
to be tempted.

480
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.300
Yes, help them but watch yourself.

481
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.000
As you bear one of those burdens and fulfill the law of Christ.

482
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.300
And so there's an individual warning there's this humble self-aware

483
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.300
help.

484
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.200
And the goal would be again for it to stop right there

485
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.200
that you've gained your brother. Jesus says that means

486
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.400
they've repented their Desiring to walk on God's pathway again.

487
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.200
You don't want it to go. Any farther right sin is not

488
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.000
good for anyone.

489
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.100
If you're trying to keep it managed that thing's gonna break open

490
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.100
that door at some point at the worst time.

491
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.800
And it's gonna destroy you in many others if you keep stuffing it

492
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.300
as we'll see we don't want it to go further. We

493
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.100
want that immediate repentance right there. It's done.

494
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.500
Sadly, it doesn't always work out. That way. Does it?

495
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.700
Sometimes they refuse to listen.

496
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.100
To many conversations you have with them and it's

497
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.500
over and over and over again, or they start pushing back on you.

498
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.700
At least to The Next Step that we go with another.

499
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.000
That's what Jesus said we go with another.

500
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.100
Again, the goal is to keep the circle as small as possible.

501
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.300
That you're not gossiping about this like

502
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.900
you're not sharing a prayer request about that person.

503
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.800
That's not part of this deal.

504
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.300
But you care enough about them not to let them go. So you

505
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.800
take one or two with you you take objective observers with

506
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.200
you to have further conversations with it. So

507
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.100
that's not you getting your cronies together to go gang up on the person if

508
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.000
the idea is that you both might be

509
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.000
seeing this and correctly.

510
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.200
You both might be misunderstanding something because we want

511
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.800
to be sure in this process that what we're addressing is

512
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.300
actually a Biblical sin issue.

513
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.700
not preference

514
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.500
Hey Brother listen

515
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.200
I mean the guys we saw you.

516
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.200
so you're wearing a brown belt with black pants and

517
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.200
Listen, we're gonna need to go through your closet with

518
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.200
you. No, right.

519
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.200
You might need to go with them to the store,

520
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.300
but I'm saying that's not a thin issue.

521
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.100
I know it's silly. But listen.

522
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.000
How often do we start to creep

523
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.400
into those personal preference and conviction issues

524
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.200
ourselves? That's not biblical.

525
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.200
And we say that's a sin issue and we start to divide over that

526
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.400
and call people out over that that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking

527
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:56.500
about.

528
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.900
sin issues in God's word

529
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.400
And as you bring someone with you Clarity comes to

530
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.700
the situation you both understand things a little bit.

531
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.400
But hopefully also if somebody comes with you that that person begins to

532
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.800
see how big a deal this sin really is.

533
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.100
You can say to them look brother. This is this is right

534
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.300
here you're doing this and it's dangerous if you

535
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.700
keep this track and somebody else is with you.

536
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.200
Again, you're praying the whole time that this would be the end that it stops

537
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.800
there that they repent they finally realize this is something I need

538
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.000
to turn from their heart changes. They make it

539
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.200
right with the person. They've hurt all of those things and it's

540
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.600
over.

541
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.900
Sadly doesn't always work out that way, right?

542
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.200
Sometimes they continue refusing to listen or they push back even

543
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.800
harder on things or what happens they run off from from you

544
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.400
and the church leads to the last piece here. You warn

545
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.100
them as a church.

546
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.300
You warn them as a church and just like that first step that previous step probably

547
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.800
had multiple iterations. You're trying to win their heart. You're multiple conversations

548
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.500
over and over again. But in this case at this

549
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.100
point again trying to keep the circle as small as

550
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.700
possible. We don't just blast it out on an email. You probably first

551
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.800
come to the elders and we make that intentional

552
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.500
effort we go to them and we try to talk with

553
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.100
them about what's going on. But but really here's the

554
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.700
truth at this point in the journey.

555
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.900
That person's often so hard-hearted. They'll refuse to listen to anybody.

556
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.800
Even if the whole church would know.

557
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.900
Even the whole church was pleading and praying and and calling

558
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.400
for repentance from blatant sin. There's no change in

559
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:40.800
their heart.

560
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.600
That's why Jesus said it at the end of Matthew 18 is 17

561
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.300
if he refuses to listen even to the church. Let him be to

562
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.700
you as a gentile and a tax collector.

563
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.200
The way Paul said in Titus 3 was to have nothing more

564
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.900
to do with him knowing such a person's warped sinful self

565
00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.600
condemned.

566
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.800
Galatians 5 19 through 21 says comprehensively. This

567
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.900
is not just big sins but everything persisting

568
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.500
in that if you are led by the

569
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500
flesh The Works of the flesh are evident.

570
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.900
sexual morality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery

571
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.500
enmity strife

572
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.300
jealousy fits of anger rivalries dissensions

573
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.800
divisions

574
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.200
Envy drunkenness orgies things like

575
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.300
these I warn you as I warned you before those who

576
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.900
do and that we're do as a continual doing marked

577
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.800
by such things will not inherit

578
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.000
the kingdom of God.

579
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.000
so

580
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.500
if someone refuses to repent over blatant sin

581
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.100
being warned over and over through tears,

582
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.600
we are to treat them as

583
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.200
if they are an unbeliever.

584
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.700
That's what Jesus said Gentile and tax collector. That's the phrase used often

585
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.500
for those who are outside the faith. He's talking

586
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.500
about being an unbeliever because jesus' goal

587
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.400
is the same as Paul's. Jesus said I want to protect the church.

588
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.200
Want to give a pure picture of the

589
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.500
church to the world Unity within the church to the

590
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.500
world. I want to protect it.

591
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.400
But listen, I don't want you to miss something really really important here.

592
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.300
Because I remember how I started this whole thing.

593
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.400
We assume.

594
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.400
That in a believer's life. The holy spirit is at work.

595
00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.600
Right. Holy spirit planted in you and belief. We assume

596
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.100
that a Believer has the Holy Spirit working in

597
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.600
them. So if you continue to refuse

598
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.500
the call to repentance over

599
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.200
and over pleading with you to turn we have

600
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.300
to wonder if the holy spirit is in there.

601
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:00.700
now

602
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.800
we don't know.

603
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.500
We're not able to declare whether someone's a Believer or not.

604
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.700
That's God's deal. That's between that person and God,

605
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.300
but what we do believe is that the Holy Spirit Will

606
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.200
convict of sin.

607
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.200
The holy spirit will lead towards righteousness. Even if you have

608
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.200
to use other people to get us there he will do it.

609
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.400
And so hear me, we're not in any way declaring someone an

610
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.400
unbeliever in this process.

611
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.300
They've just self-identified as one.

612
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.700
As Titus 3:11. He says he is self condemned.

613
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.800
Based on the way that their life track has gone.

614
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.500
Jesus says treat them as an unbeliever because it

615
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.600
seems like they are.

616
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.400
Now, I know this all seems kind of harsh.

617
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.600
But there's a question we often miss at that point.

618
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:06.900
It's something I think.

619
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.700
It's critical and all this when you look at all of what scripture says.

620
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.700
How are we to treat unbelievers?

621
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.200
Scriptures very clear that we are to love them.

622
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.700
We are to care for them.

623
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.400
We are to pray for them.

624
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.400
We are to preach the gospel to them.

625
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.700
We just are not to be unequally yoked.

626
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.700
with unbelievers

627
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.300
means we don't share with them the things

628
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.600
that are reserved for the faith family.

629
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.700
This is General truth that you should be the closest with

630
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.500
fellow Believers not with unbelievers.

631
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.200
Those should be your closest friends as believers.

632
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.400
Now for somebody in this stage of life that

633
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.700
state you should be there when their life falls apart. Absolutely.

634
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.100
but if they've gotten to that point you've done all that you

635
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:11.500
can

636
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.800
it's God's work.

637
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.300
He has to change a heart.

638
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.200
They're actually hoping this.

639
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.600
Because our stories throughout church history of members of churches who

640
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.700
are deceived by the enemy caught up in sin. They they

641
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.300
got confronted over the sin. They ran away

642
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.000
accused the Church of judgmentalism. You guys are just being stuck up

643
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.100
all of those things one day though.

644
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.000
As they wandered through the desert of their life.

645
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.000
God wooed their heart back to him.

646
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:51.900
and and

647
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.500
Suddenly, they saw those people who had come after them in

648
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.100
their sin before.

649
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.800
Not as judgmental, but is actually loving.

650
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.000
That factor cared for me.

651
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.100
They saw that I was doing this and they came after me they confronted sin

652
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.400
in my life. But that actually meant they cared

653
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.000
they loved and they remembered Jesus in that.

654
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.100
So yes all this is hard.

655
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.800
It may seem impossible. Someone's gotten this far to change but does not

656
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.500
have to be the end of their story.

657
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.400
It doesn't have to be the end of your story either because you remember

658
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.000
the gospel.

659
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.600
You remember what got the gospel that we saw in Titus 3 verses 3

660
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.500
through 5 last week that we are selves were

661
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.500
once foolish disobedient LED astray slaves to

662
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.200
various passions and Pleasures passing our days and Malice and

663
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.000
envy hated by others hating one another.

664
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:43.400
but

665
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.300
when the goodness and loving kindness of God our savior

666
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.100
appeared he saved us not because of Works done by

667
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.500
us and righteousness. But according to his own Mercy by

668
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.600
the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.

669
00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.200
See the reality here is that this old man? We've

670
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.100
been talking about can be a new man.

671
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.300
Right, the old man does not have to be who you are. It doesn't

672
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.200
mean you have to stay the way you are. He's an old man can

673
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.500
be a new man in Christ.

674
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.500
And that's possible. Listen that's possible for the worst sinner,

675
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.200
you know in your life.

676
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.200
that woman you look at and say

677
00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.600
she's the like that it's possible for her.

678
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.600
that's possible for

679
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.100
the church member who's grown up playing a religious game their whole

680
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:32.200
life.

681
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.600
is possible even

682
00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.300
for you

683
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.600
But what it takes.

684
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.300
It takes Brokenness. It takes repentance. It

685
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.200
takes setting aside the fear of what other people think.

686
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.500
Listen, I know.

687
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.100
I know from my own experience that there are many people in this room

688
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.300
today who are hiding sin.

689
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.000
Who are walking in this this internal

690
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.300
embarrassment over what you've been doing and you

691
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.400
know it and you don't want to tell anyone yet. You're

692
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.900
putting on a smile and you're playing the part.

693
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.000
Can I tell you something?

694
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.200
Stop it.

695
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.000
just stop

696
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.600
don't you want to walk in the freedom that Christ

697
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.700
has purchased for you?

698
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.100
Instead of hiding back here and chained up don't you

699
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.900
want to walk in that freedom? I know it's terrifying to

700
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.200
think of exposing that to your loved one

701
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200
or to a friend.

702
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.200
I know that sick feeling in your stomach right

703
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.700
now you think about even doing that?

704
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.100
I know how terrifying it is because you don't know what's gonna

705
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.400
come on the other side of that. How are they going to respond? You have? No, it's scary.

706
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.500
Absolutely. It is but hear me you should

707
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.500
be way more concerned about how you respond to God than what

708
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:03.900
that feels like.

709
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.300
He sees it all anyway.

710
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:10.900
You're not hiding.

711
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.600
Yet don't forget this.

712
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.000
The best part is that he knew you were gonna do it.

713
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.500
Any new you're gonna hide it.

714
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.400
And yet he died for you on the cross anyway.

715
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.100
He knew it was coming.

716
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.300
and you as his enemy he looked at you and said

717
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.500
I want you my family.

718
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.000
Open your hands up.

719
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.600
Open your hands get rid of this acts 3:19

720
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.800
says repent and return that your sins

721
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.000
may be wiped away. In order that times of

722
00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.400
refreshing may come to

723
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:56.900
your soul.
