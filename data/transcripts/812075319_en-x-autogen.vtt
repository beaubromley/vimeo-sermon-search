00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
here

2
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, happy Sunday to you church. It's great to be back with you had a

3
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.400
great week off last week, but it's also great to know that God's word will still

4
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.100
be proclaimed. Even when I'm not here. I didn't Craig do

5
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
a great job last week with Psalms. I mean, it just was a

6
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.400
powerful powerful story and I pray in fact affected your

7
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.500
life as it did mine watching it later. But

8
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
here's the the thought today as

9
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.100
we go into today and over the next couple weeks. It's going

10
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.300
to be a little bit different than what we normally do walking through books

11
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.100
to the Bible. But as you just saw we're starting a short series around Easter

12
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.900
called that you may believe

13
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.400
and that phrase is taken from John 20 30 and

14
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.700
31 where the Apostle John said that out of the the millions

15
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.600
of options. He could have picked to write

16
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.500
down he chose what he chose to write

17
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.800
because he wanted you to believe that

18
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
Jesus is the Christ the son of God and that

19
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.000
by believing you would have life in his name.

20
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.300
So that was his purpose in writing and so we know that's why John was written

21
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.200
but if you think about it.

22
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
there's first four books of the New Testament of Matthew Mark Luke

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.900
and John like I just mentioned if you think about it, that's

24
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
What we can safely assume that that's why all four

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.300
of those would have written right? So in Matthew

26
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.800
and Mark and Luke would have written also.

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.500
So that people would believe that Jesus

28
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.400
is the son of God.

29
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300
Because when you think about it, they were not writing biographies about

30
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.800
Jesus.

31
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.300
Because they exclude so much of his life. It's a

32
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.700
terrible biography right you skip so many years. It's

33
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.800
just there's there's certain parts that they selected. They

34
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.600
were not writing biographies. They were writing gospel

35
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.700
accounts.

36
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.300
That's why if you look at the title of each in your Bible and when

37
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.400
you look at it, it actually says The Gospel according to

38
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.100
Matthew or to Mark

39
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.500
or Luke or John. That's the actual title. Not just the

40
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.700
name.

41
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.500
By the way, remember that the word gospel in the original language actually just means

42
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
good news. So they would tell gospels of

43
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.300
Victories and other things the gospel is good

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
news. Well good news about what here if we're

45
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.600
talking about. This gospel. Good news about Jesus, right?

46
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
Specifically as First Corinthians 15 says specifically

47
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.300
jesus' life death and Resurrection. That's the

48
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.700
gospel good news that we are talking about here. That's

49
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.700
why each of these four gospel writers focused primarily

50
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.300
on the last three years of jesus' Earthly

51
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.600
life.

52
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.500
That's the time frame that mostly encompasses his

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.300
public life his death his resurrection.

54
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.400
That was their main priority. Why because again,

55
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.100
they wanted their readers.

56
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.000
And you and I to believe.

57
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.000
This is what they wanted people to believe and so over the next

58
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.700
three weeks. We're going to look at The Gospel according to

59
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.600
Matthew the Gospel According to Mark and

60
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.900
The Gospel according to John.

61
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.100
Now, why do we skip Luke? Well, because we did Luke last year the whole

62
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.200
Easter was around Luke. And so we saw that now

63
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200
we're going to Matthew Mark and John this year and we're going to see

64
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.200
how each one of those uniquely shows their

65
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.400
perspective on this good news

66
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400
about Jesus.

67
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.200
Why did Matthew and Mark and John say it

68
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.300
the way they said it as they looked at the good news of Jesus

69
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.200
and what we're praying for is for belief as a result

70
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.500
of that.

71
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.700
That you may believe.

72
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.800
That's the goal.

73
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.500
So just as a heads up, like I said, it's going to be a little bit different. We're

74
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.600
going to bounce around some.

75
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.600
We're gonna get a little technical at times.

76
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.300
And so it's going to at times feel a little apologetically.

77
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.700
I don't if that's even a word but sounds right.

78
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.700
So we're gonna it's gonna sound some of that like defending

79
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.000
the face in some ways.

80
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.400
Which means kids students?

81
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.400
It's going to feel a little bit like an upper level course in some

82
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.200
ways. We're going to talk some technical things. And so I know

83
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.100
you guys can handle that. And so you're going to follow along right with me, right?

84
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.700
This is how it's going to be.

85
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.600
Because for many of us adults included

86
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.600
you will be challenged and helped

87
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.100
by this in your faith.

88
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.600
Because there's going to be things you're going to learn about who God

89
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.800
is new things that you've never thought through before he

90
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800
worked how he worked how he let us read

91
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.900
about it in his word.

92
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.700
Listen, I even know that some of you are are skeptical.

93
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.500
You're doubting this whole thing about Christianity in general faith.

94
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.500
Which Jesus really who he said was even real and you're

95
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.800
wavering.

96
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.500
Maybe you have faith but you don't really have

97
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.300
certainty about some things My Hope Is that in

98
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.500
all of this? You would see the kind of firm foundation

99
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.700
you can have in Jesus.

100
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.900
This would lead you towards that.

101
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.600
And finally, I don't know there's some of you who think man. I already know all that.

102
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.500
even if you know everything that I'm about to say

103
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.800
Let this series reawaken you.

104
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.400
to the The Wonder of the Gospel

105
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.500
to the beauty and infinite depths of

106
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.600
the grace of God for us.

107
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.700
Let this stir your affection for Jesus even more this Easter

108
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.800
season.

109
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600
It's got help us towards that.

110
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.700
Help us towards those ends whether we're Believers or

111
00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.900
not.

112
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.400
mature immature wherever we land on

113
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.400
this God show us who you are lead

114
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.300
us to see you and believe

115
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.400
in the sense of you wanting us

116
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.700
to believe

117
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.200
help us God.

118
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.700
In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.

119
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.900
Okay. So today we're going to be in The Gospel according to Matthew. And

120
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.200
so take your copy of God's word and turn there with

121
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.000
me Matthew chapter 27 is where we're going to end up Landing very

122
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.700
end of Matthew the very end of chapter 27, Matthew

123
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.000
27.

124
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.600
Before we get there though.

125
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.200
Some work we need to do to set a foundation. We

126
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.400
need to First understand the nature of these

127
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400
gospels of the Gospel accounts.

128
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.300
We understand the nature of the gospels and we

129
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.500
need to understand the makeup of these first four books

130
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.800
of the New Testament that tell us the good news of Jesus.

131
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.400
So as I said that they do contain biographical information

132
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.200
like who is parents and where he lived those kind

133
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.100
of things, but they're not biographies about Jesus.

134
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.100
What these are is these are eyewitness testimony?

135
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.200
Each of these four are eyewitness testimony.

136
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.400
This is the nature of the gospels. They were collecting

137
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.600
each four. Each of the four were collecting first-hand accounts of Jesus's

138
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.800
life.

139
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.700
Now I want to be clear as we jump into this.

140
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.100
In all of this. I'm assuming the Holy Spirit has inspired

141
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.100
it all along the way.

142
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.800
Right. This is not just four guys writing down things for posterity. Right

143
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.600
this this is the holy spirit inspiring these words. That's

144
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.000
why we can call this God's word with confidence.

145
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.200
So I might not say that all the time but no that's behind the scenes

146
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.800
of this. Okay?

147
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.300
Critical but but how he did that is interesting how he

148
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.300
did that is by using either the person writing or

149
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.600
a direct source who was there?

150
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.600
So think about it Matthew also called Levi

151
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.000
in some parts. He he was one of

152
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.800
the Twelve Apostles. He was a tax collector before he followed Jesus and

153
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.200
so Matthew was there he saw it

154
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.300
heard it. He felt it.

155
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.600
That's Matthew. Then you have Mark who's all known as John Mark

156
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.300
later in the Bible. He probably got everything.

157
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.300
He wrote from Peter.

158
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.600
Close compatriot with Peter.

159
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.200
Although next week. I'm going to argue that Mark was actually there too. I think

160
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.700
but anyway, we'll get to that next week.

161
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.400
Luke was a doctor who traveled with Paul and did

162
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.800
extensive research into all of this talking to eyewitness accounts

163
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.500
recording it all.

164
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.300
And then you have John one of The Twelve Apostles is

165
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.200
where as well. Even even in the Inner Circle

166
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.300
of three that Jesus had John was one of those and so

167
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.100
he would have seen it and heard it all.

168
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.700
But again, they were not just writing for the future just to record events.

169
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.600
They wanted people to believe right?

170
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.800
That's what John said. I already read that earlier. This is what Luke wrote

171
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.300
his for. This is Luke chapter 1 verses

172
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.600
1 through 4 in as much as many of undertaken to compile

173
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.200
and Narrative of the things that have been accomplished Among Us

174
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.500
just as those who were from the beginning where I Witnesses

175
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.300
and Ministers of the word have delivered them to

176
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.200
us, right? So he's saying I talked to people who are there.

177
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.200
It seemed good to me. Also having followed all things

178
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.300
closely for some time past to write an orderly

179
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.600
account for you. Most excellent Theophilus. Now here

180
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.500
it is that you may have certainty concerning

181
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.600
the things you've been taught.

182
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.600
So that you may believe right? That's what Luke says

183
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.900
even he wrote for so when you read the gospels,

184
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.400
they don't read like a biography.

185
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.000
And that's on point that's on purpose. They

186
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.000
read like an eyewitness getting up and sharing their

187
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.200
testimony in a courtroom. Yeah, you've seen

188
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.300
this before maybe maybe you've seen it in a movie or TV show and you

189
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.300
see what happens when the testimony is given by an eyewitness, right?

190
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.600
Here's what I saw. Here's what I heard. Here's who

191
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.700
was there here's how they reacted. Here's what I felt right?

192
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.400
That's I witness testimony. That's what's going

193
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.700
on here in the Gospels.

194
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.900
eyewitness testimony

195
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.100
So it doesn't always follow perfect order. So it doesn't always follow

196
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.400
chronologically, right? There's testimony. They're giving

197
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.800
to who he is.

198
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.600
Along with that. Here's the second characteristic of the gospels. It's

199
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.200
that they were independently written.

200
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.600
I believe they were independently written.

201
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.400
Now many people believe today that Mark was written first.

202
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.800
And then Matthew and Luke were based on it along

203
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.500
with another source called

204
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.800
q that we don't have any record of or any account

205
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.900
of any more.

206
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.300
The problem with that is that the Bible never says

207
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.100
that's how it went down.

208
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.100
And early Christians you go

209
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.600
back and read early writings. They nearly all agreed

210
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.900
that Matthew was written first.

211
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.200
And that they didn't use Matthew. They just wrote them

212
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.800
independently.

213
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.200
The probably now now think about this they were all in

214
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.400
their same circles. So they probably would have exchanged some information along the

215
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.300
way and say hey when we were at that place that what

216
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.000
did he say that and they would have to recall what it was.

217
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.300
But each of them also had sources of information that the others didn't

218
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.400
have.

219
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.500
So you have these these inward accounts from John you

220
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.400
have these others friends that they met that Luke research

221
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.800
that that Mark didn't talk to you. See there's Independence there

222
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.300
now are all the gospels similar.

223
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.400
Yeah.

224
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.500
Especially Matthew Mark and Luke are are very

225
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.000
similar in the way. They write things. Why is that?

226
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.900
Because the holy spirit's inspiring this thing, right?

227
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.500
He's superintending how all of this works, but also think

228
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.900
about how the early church worked.

229
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.500
They were constantly repeating all of this information to each

230
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.700
other that were recounting jesus' work

231
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.400
his words. They were talking with this one another

232
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.300
in early Church Life.

233
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.500
That's why Acts 2 remember Acts 2:42. They

234
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.300
devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.

235
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.800
What were the apostles teaching?

236
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.400
Jesus

237
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.500
Jesus did said acted like

238
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.700
thought like this they were teaching.

239
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.600
What Jesus had done?

240
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.200
And so think they were devoted to it repeated it over and

241
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.500
over and over and over it became very similar.

242
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.500
So why are there differences?

243
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.500
Were they not just memorizing a bunch of facts about Jesus? Why are

244
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.700
there differences between the four Gospels?

245
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.500
Well first because they're uniquely written right Matthew wrote Mark wrote.

246
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.300
Luke wrote John wrote. We're going to highlight some of those differences along

247
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.600
the way in the next couple weeks.

248
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.700
but let me give you an example think of how

249
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.700
differently a husband and a wife would

250
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.400
describe what they did yesterday.

251
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.000
husband

252
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.500
What'd you do?

253
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.600
Well, we worked in the yard. We went to the hardware store and we

254
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.000
had lunch.

255
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.600
The wife would say we planted

256
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.500
flowers. We talked to our friends at

257
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.300
the store that we saw and we hadn't seen them a long

258
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.400
time. And then we we had an argument

259
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.300
at lunch because he ordered a milkshake even though he's lactose intolerant and

260
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.300
we had like all of that.

261
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.600
Now are there discrepancies there?

262
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.400
No.

263
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.500
Those things happened.

264
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.900
They just look at it from a different angle, right?

265
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.200
She saw running into the

266
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.200
friends at the store as a much bigger deal than going to the hardware

267
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.000
store in first place.

268
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.500
And so she kind of omitted that fact but it happened. She

269
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.700
just didn't say anything about it because she was focused on the friends.

270
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.300
And he completely forgot that they had the argument because the lunch was a

271
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.900
highlight of his day.

272
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.900
Right. So you see how this all works together. That's

273
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.800
the nature of eyewitness testimony it all

274
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.400
is the same events. It's just from a different angle that

275
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.200
they're looking at it.

276
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.500
It's the nature of it you get the same Basics, but you get a different focus. And

277
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.800
so that that leads to the third characteristic of

278
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.900
the Gospels.

279
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.900
Is that they were each uniquely focused.

280
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.300
There's four of them and each of the four had a unique

281
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.000
Focus. They told the good news of Jesus from

282
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.600
an angle.

283
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.900
and we shouldn't be too strict on these categories, but generally

284
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.400
Generally, you can say that Matthew is the gospel of

285
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.600
the Messiah.

286
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.800
The Christ the promised one and he's

287
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.800
focused on people with a Jewish background.

288
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.500
We'll get into that a little bit later mark.

289
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.700
Is the gospel of the suffering Son of God?

290
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.400
Mark moves really fast through things, but it's also the

291
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.000
most simple and direct to understand.

292
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.300
Then you have Luke.

293
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.200
as the gospel of the Savior for all people

294
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.900
even the Gentiles like you and me. He said

295
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.000
Jesus came for them too, because that's what Luke was.

296
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.400
And he highlights major themes of

297
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.900
Jesus's life and Ministry throughout his gospel.

298
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.400
And you have John is the gospel of

299
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.600
the Divine son who reveals the

300
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.000
father.

301
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.700
The most theological of all the gospels, but also

302
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.200
the most different he wrote really late compared to

303
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.400
the other three it seems and so it's very different.

304
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.000
But you can see why he wrote that way. Each each

305
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.300
was inspired Again by the Holy Spirit to write

306
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.700
in a certain way, but they were looking at it this life death

307
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.300
and resurrection of Jesus. They were looking at it through certain lenses.

308
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.400
They were looking at it through priorities that

309
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.100
they had as they were writing these accounts of Jesus.

310
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.100
They each wanted to accentuate a specific and unique

311
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.300
portrait of Jesus.

312
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.200
Yet yet. They're amazingly cohesive.

313
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.500
Even as they're looking at it from these angles. It's cohesive again

314
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.500
as a result of the holy spirit superintending all

315
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.100
of it.

316
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.000
But think about their diversity then.

317
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.800
They're cohesive and they fit together, but they're diversity

318
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.400
only gives us a deeper richer

319
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.400
Glimpse at this mystery of

320
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:44.700
Christ.

321
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.700
You can see things when you start to walk together that just

322
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.200
just deepen your faith in that.

323
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.900
There's no contradictions here.

324
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.900
There's things we have to kind of think through of course, but there's no contradictions.

325
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.600
And so when you look at differences between the Gospels, don't

326
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.300
let those lead you away from Christ.

327
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.300
Don't let that lead you away from Christ. Let the different

328
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.500
facets you see in Matthew and Mark and Luke and

329
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.400
John let that lead you to Christ. Let those lead

330
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.500
you to worship him when you see the depth

331
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.600
and richness of our God.

332
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.100
But as I talk through all those differences and all those similarities and things like

333
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.400
that at the core of everything in all four Gospels.

334
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.500
Is the basic Narrative of the Gospel

335
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.000
message?

336
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.500
The Narrative of good news about Jesus's life

337
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.400
death and Resurrection

338
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.500
Right. That's the thread through all of

339
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:46.800
it.

340
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.200
Now the gospels each of them includes more than that, right? You've

341
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.300
got Parables You've Got Back stories and

342
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.200
all those things. Yeah, you've got a lot of other things in there, but the

343
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.400
basic thread that I'm about to share

344
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.900
with you gonna walk through it quickly is in

345
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.800
all four of them.

346
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.100
And it's nearly exactly you can pull all of

347
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.500
this out from nearly all four exactly.

348
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.300
And listen, this is something that you and I need to need to

349
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.400
be remembering.

350
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.400
Not only at this season of Easter.

351
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.500
but all year

352
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.500
we talked a lot about here being a gospel-centered people

353
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.400
gospel-centered church. It's because this is the

354
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.200
power of God for salvation for those who believe.

355
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.500
The gospel is not not just the Bible not just

356
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.300
church. It is the gospel.

357
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.500
And so what do we need to remember?

358
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.300
This Easter season as we go the rest

359
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.500
of our lives. What is the thread running through all four

360
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.900
gospels that that is the good news of

361
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.400
Jesus life death and Resurrection.

362
00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.200
Well, what is it? It's that Jesus.

363
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.100
Was eternal and yet took on flesh and

364
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.100
was born of a virgin 2000 years ago.

365
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.200
He lived a perfect life in submission to

366
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.500
his Earthly parents for 30 years.

367
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.600
He performed then publicly Miracles and he

368
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.100
taught old truths in a new and refined kind of

369
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.400
way.

370
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.600
and he was marked by the religious leaders

371
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.200
as an insurrectionist and he he was

372
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.100
he was being searched as a way to destroy him.

373
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.300
Because he was gaining a following.

374
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.500
But he was in control the whole time.

375
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.800
Over nature over his own life over even his

376
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.700
opposers.

377
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.400
And after three years of ministry a week before

378
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.300
the Passover, he entered Jerusalem fully aware

379
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.600
of what awaited him on the other side of that wall.

380
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.600
And he walks into the temple and cleanses it as an illustration of

381
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.100
what he's coming to do spiritually.

382
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.300
And he defeated and debated the

383
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.300
religious leaders and predicted what was coming

384
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.500
for those who don't repent and don't turn to him as

385
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.600
the Messiah.

386
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.200
And as he entered that night he observed the

387
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.600
Passover meal with his disciples and in

388
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.300
that he washed their feet. He took his disciples then out

389
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.600
to the Garden to pray with them and he was betrayed there

390
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.500
by one of his friends.

391
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.100
He washed their feet, even the one who

392
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.200
was about to betray me. He knew it was coming

393
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.700
and yet he did it anyway.

394
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.700
And in that betrayal he was wrongfully arrested. He

395
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.300
was illegal illegally tried multiple times. He

396
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.300
was denied three times in that by one of his closest friends.

397
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.100
And he was tortured he was nailed to a cross and he

398
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.400
was mocked. He was spat upon in that and he

399
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.500
finally on that cross gave up his life to pay the penalty for

400
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.800
our sin.

401
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.800
And when he died the curtain of the temple split

402
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.100
into top to bottom reopening the

403
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.000
way back to God he was taken down from the

404
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.600
cross. He was buried in a new Tomb.

405
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.300
but

406
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.600
after three days

407
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.300
He walked out of that tomb alive

408
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.000
again.

409
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.500
And so what he did in that moment is he appeared

410
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.800
to many that hundreds of people who proved

411
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.300
that he was resurrected and then when he

412
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.500
spent some time with them he ascended back

413
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.400
to heaven where he now sits as the King of Kings over

414
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.000
all things.

415
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.900
And so in that last whatever many seconds that is

416
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.600
the thread that flows through the

417
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.300
Gospels.

418
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.800
Because it is the gospel.

419
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.600
Because it is the good news of Jesus

420
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.300
in our place of sinners like

421
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.600
you and me having a hope in him. And why

422
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.100
did he do all that?

423
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.500
He did all that because he loves.

424
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.200
Because he loves us and again, that's not

425
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.500
a truth that we should remember only at Easter. That's

426
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.000
a truth for every season.

427
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.400
It's a truth for every day. It's the basic gospel that

428
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.300
we must look for and we must celebrate when we see it

429
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.200
throughout the gospels when we understand it being taught by Paul

430
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.800
later. We see it being predicted in the Old Testament. That's the

431
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.200
gospel. We celebrate here.

432
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.900
And so that's the thread yet as I said before.

433
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.100
I said that there are nuances in each of

434
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.800
these four gospels that deepen our

435
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.300
understanding of who Jesus is and what he's done.

436
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.800
Right. There's a reason that these look at it from an angle and

437
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.600
we're going to look at Matthew specifically today his uniqueness.

438
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.500
Mark next week John on Easter Sunday

439
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.400
with all of that. What is it about

440
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.500
what they write that makes it unique that

441
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.400
we can understand and believe who Jesus actually is

442
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.400
So you remember that that Matthew?

443
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.700
Matthew was written mostly to a Jewish audience.

444
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.200
They would have had the what we know as the Old

445
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.800
Testament.

446
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.700
And they would have read that looking for the Messiah

447
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.600
and so they're reading it with those lenses on

448
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.700
and that's why Matthew focuses. So

449
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.400
heavily on how Jesus fulfilled the Old

450
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.300
Testament prophecies.

451
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.400
Because Matthew wanted his readers primarily Jewish people

452
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.300
to believe that Jesus was

453
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.200
foretold.

454
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.900
He was predicted. This is the one you've been waiting for the Messiah

455
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.400
here. He is and so all over Matthew.

456
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.600
There are references to the Old Testament.

457
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.400
Some are very clear some are kind of vague, but

458
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.800
there's at least 20 times.

459
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.800
In 28 chapters where Matthew explicitly ties

460
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.600
something that Jesus says or does

461
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.600
something about Jesus ties it to an Old Testament

462
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.500
Prophecy of the Messiah to come.

463
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.100
more than any other gospels Matthew does this

464
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.800
Because he's writing in that angle.

465
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.300
It's what Jesus himself did so Matthew don't think Matthew is like

466
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.600
coming up with something out of thin air here.

467
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.700
Jesus himself did this I'm going to quote something from Luke. But

468
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.200
but listen to what Jesus does Luke 24:27.

469
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.200
This is after he resurrected. He's walking on the road to

470
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.700
Emmaus talking to these buddies beginning with Moses

471
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.100
and all the prophets.

472
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.400
Now that would be what we know as the Old Testament Moses and

473
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.700
the prophets the first five books and the prophets That Old Testament

474
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.200
so long before Jesus showed up on the

475
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.400
scene physically right beginning with Moses and

476
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.400
the prophets Jesus interpreted to them in all the

477
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.200
scriptures the things concerning himself.

478
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.700
Right. So Jesus Took the Old Testament and

479
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.200
said here's where it says this about me.

480
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.500
Here's what it shows me. Here's what it shows me. Jesus himself

481
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.800
did what Matthew is doing?

482
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.100
because again

483
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.700
Matthew wanted to convince his readers to

484
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.000
believe.

485
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.000
Let's look at this. Do you not see it?

486
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.300
Jewish primarily Jewish readers like do you

487
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.200
see Jesus is the promised Messiah? He's

488
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.100
the one even waiting for.

489
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:25.800
believe

490
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.300
Give your life.

491
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.500
Well, that's what then brings us to Matthew chapter

492
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.700
27.

493
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.300
Some of your like finally that was the longest introduction in the history

494
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.300
of introductions.

495
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.600
You see now where I'm going with this.

496
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.200
We're going to start in Matthew 27 starting in verse 62 gonna

497
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.700
read into chapter 28 a little bit.

498
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.100
But but notice this is right after Jesus was

499
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.600
taken off the cross. He was buried.

500
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.200
in the Tomb Here's Where We

501
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.400
Are

502
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.400
Matthew 27 verse 62

503
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.100
So jesus' body still in the Tomb at this point the next

504
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.500
day that is after the day of preparation the chief priests

505
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.200
and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate. That's the Roman

506
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.700
leader in that area. He said sir. We

507
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.300
remember how that impostor said while

508
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.800
he was still alive after three days. I will rise.

509
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.300
therefore pilate order the tomb to be made secure until

510
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.300
the third day lest his disciples go

511
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.500
and steal him away and tell the people he's risen from

512
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.200
the dead and the last fraud will

513
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.200
be worse than the first

514
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.600
so pilate said to them. All right, you have a guard a number of soldiers

515
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.800
go make it as secure as you can.

516
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.800
So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting

517
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.400
a guard.

518
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.200
into 28 now after the Sabbath

519
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.200
so this would be Sunday morning toward the dawn of the first

520
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.400
day of the week Mary Magdalene the other Mary went to

521
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.100
see the tomb.

522
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.700
And behold there was a great earthquake.

523
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.400
For an age of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled

524
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.200
back the stone and sat on it.

525
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.300
His appearance was like lightning his clothing. Why does

526
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.600
snow and for fear of him? The guards trembled

527
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.000
and became like dead men.

528
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.900
But the angel said to the women do not be afraid.

529
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.400
For I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.

530
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.000
He is not here for he has risen

531
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.000
as he said.

532
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.600
Come see the place where he lay.

533
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.400
Like get proof look he's not here and then go quickly

534
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.200
and tell his disciples that he has risen from the

535
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.200
dead and behold he's going before you to Galilee there. You will

536
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.400
see him. See I've told you.

537
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.100
And so the women departed quickly from the tomb and with

538
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.300
fear and great joy and ran to tell

539
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.700
his disciples and behold Jesus met them.

540
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.300
And said greetings and they

541
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.400
came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him and Jesus

542
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.100
said to them just like the angel do not be afraid.

543
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.100
Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee and there they'll see

544
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.300
me.

545
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.400
I look at verse 11, we don't often read this part while they were going behold.

546
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.700
Some of the Guard went into the City and told

547
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.600
the chief priests all that had taken place.

548
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.200
And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they

549
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.500
gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers and

550
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.300
said tell people his disciples came by

551
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.800
night and stole him away while we were asleep.

552
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.400
And if this comes to the governor's ears, we'll satisfy him

553
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.600
and keep you out of trouble.

554
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.600
So they took the money and did as they were directed and this story

555
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.800
has been spread among the Jews to this

556
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.400
day.

557
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.200
Now, why did I choose this passage of

558
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:57.800
scripture today?

559
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.800
Out of all the rest. Why did I pick this one?

560
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.700
because the majority of these verses

561
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.300
only occur in Matthew and not

562
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.900
any of the other gospel accounts.

563
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.200
Nobody else talks about the guards. Nobody else talks about

564
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.600
the angel. Nobody else talks about this this interaction behind

565
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.000
the scenes with the guards and the chief leaders.

566
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.100
Why would Matthew include those?

567
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.600
When no one else did why would Matthew pick these things

568
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.200
out of the millions of things? Why did Matthew pick this? What

569
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.500
was his purpose in writing remember?

570
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.800
to convince the Jews to believe

571
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.200
and so what was going on here?

572
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.200
Well Matthew was giving an account of how

573
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.800
the Jewish leaders were corrupt.

574
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.400
How the Jewish leaders were trying to cover this up how they

575
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.500
were trying to pay off the guards to lie for them so that

576
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.400
they didn't have to deal with the consequences of Jesus being alive

577
00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:58.700
again.

578
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.100
But notice what else Matthew included?

579
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.200
He says it was an angel who rolled the stone away. Nobody else

580
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.700
says that the guard saw it passed out because

581
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.100
of it.

582
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.200
And then that same Angel was who declared the truth of

583
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.000
Christ's Resurrection to the Mary's.

584
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.100
Right, the the angel opened the

585
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.400
tomb and declared the resurrection, but not only

586
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.700
all that Matthew also uniquely includes that

587
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.400
the women were the first ones to proclaim the

588
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.600
resurrection to fellow humans.

589
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.500
It was an angel to them they ran and told the disciples.

590
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.600
And so here's why all this is so important.

591
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.600
In spite of all that against it.

592
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.800
Right, so you've got the religious Elite conspiring

593
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.700
against this thing?

594
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.400
You've got an angel being involved which everybody can discount

595
00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.000
that right?

596
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.700
You've got women's testimonies who are not even admissible in

597
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.000
a court of law at that time.

598
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.500
In spite of all of that against it the

599
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.800
gospel was still going forth.

600
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.700
That right because Matthew's writing years later. He's

601
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.000
looking back at this and saying in spite of all of that against

602
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.300
it.

603
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.500
Even though there's still circulating this lie to

604
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.600
that day. He's writing. It's still going forth.

605
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.400
It's still going forth in power. See that's what Matthew

606
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.600
wanted his readers to understand.

607
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.900
Everything was stacked against this deck.

608
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.100
Like the the leader of the movement had even

609
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.200
been killed and he was behind that stone. So they

610
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.400
thought

611
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.300
but nothing could stop God's work of

612
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.300
Salvation in the world.

613
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.700
Everything everything looked like it was against this movement tiny

614
00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.000
little group of people like just a handful, right?

615
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.400
12 maybe a couple dozen more

616
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.700
That was it not some revolutionary Army the

617
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.800
leaders dead. The whole religious system is

618
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.500
against this.

619
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.900
And it's still working.

620
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.400
Nothing can stop God's work

621
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.400
of Salvation in the world.

622
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.500
Right because the promised one Matthew says had come

623
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.600
to save and deliver his people.

624
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.800
No conspiracy. No money. No power no

625
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.500
death. No bias could stop.

626
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.200
This work of God's salvation.

627
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.900
In other words, we say it this way.

628
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.700
The power of the Resurrection is Unstoppable.

629
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.100
Like he really did come back to

630
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:47.300
life.

631
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.100
There's no power stronger than that.

632
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.500
And Matthew and these other disciples they gave their

633
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.400
lives for this good news because they

634
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.800
were convinced that Jesus was the promised Messiah and

635
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.100
risen Messiah.

636
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.800
They had seen and heard and believed that this

637
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.200
Jesus lived died and resurrected for

638
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.400
them.

639
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.800
I said this is it.

640
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.100
This is the good news. There is nothing else we were living

641
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.700
for now. This is it. So again, Matthew notice

642
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.500
Matthew was making a case for his fellow

643
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.900
Jews to believe that Jesus was the

644
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.400
Messiah that this is the good news message.

645
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.800
He's pleading with his fellow Jews say

646
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.100
This Is What You Must Believe

647
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.500
Well today.

648
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.000
I've used God's word.

649
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.300
To make a case for you.

650
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.900
I've shown you eyewitnesses.

651
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.500
I've connected dots together.

652
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.300
All to show you that this is true.

653
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.500
That this is trustworthy.

654
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.700
And that you and I ought to believe in this

655
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.100
Jesus.

656
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:13.900
And so do you believe?

657
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.000
Like do you believe this have have you turned from

658
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.600
your sin and yourself? That deserves the

659
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.000
cross?

660
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.500
Have you turned from yourself in that and

661
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.600
turned to Jesus in faith in his life death

662
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.800
and Resurrection this good news counting for

663
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.500
yours.

664
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.600
if you have

665
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.200
if you have believed that then then again let

666
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.700
this let this Easter season stir your affections for

667
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.100
Jesus.

668
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.700
And this gospel is good news.

669
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.900
I want to challenge you over the next couple weeks.

670
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.700
To deeply remember the gospel.

671
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.700
To to reflect on why

672
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.700
this is so important for our lives.

673
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.600
And so often we just kind of go through this this normal

674
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.100
Christian Life and we're kind of decent people. We just

675
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.300
go through things. We we get to the end and we sort of

676
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.900
look back at the week and we're like, oh, okay, I did, okay.

677
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.400
Don't just live a Christian like kind

678
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:29.800
of life.

679
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.700
reflect on the gospel and be transformed

680
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.400
be completely new.

681
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.500
Because there's listen.

682
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.000
Resurrection is the main part of the

683
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.600
story.

684
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.100
And so when you're dead and he makes you alive don't you think

685
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.200
that's gonna change something.

686
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.700
Let that change everything and think

687
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.700
where does God even need to bring some Resurrection in

688
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.700
your life right now?

689
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.700
Like this Easter season can be a a Resurrection season

690
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.700
for some things in you.

691
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.200
That you've thought is hopeless that you've thought is just dead and you

692
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.400
you can you can dig deep into the gospel

693
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.300
and watch God bring new life.

694
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.500
challenge you to that

695
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.800
to not just go through Easter again.

696
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.600
but to deeply reflect on who he is and what he's done as Matthew

697
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600
has shown us as Mark and John will show us

698
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.300
But I know some of you haven't.

699
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.500
Repented and believed yet.

700
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:45.900
my prayer

701
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.600
Is that you've seen God's word?

702
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.500
That it can be Trust.

703
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.200
To show you who Jesus is.

704
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:56.900
this

705
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.300
is who Jesus is that he lived the perfect life

706
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.900
that you and I could never live on our own.

707
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.600
That he died a substitutionary death

708
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.000
on the cross for your sin.

709
00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.100
and then

710
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.000
He defeated sin and death by coming

711
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.300
out of that grave alive.

712
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.200
So that you can have Resurrection too.

713
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.400
You are dead in your sin.

714
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.400
eternally

715
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.100
Unless he takes you out of that grave and makes you

716
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.600
alive too.

717
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.000
By faith in this good news

718
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.100
message.

719
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.200
by faith in Jesus

720
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.300
See, this is our God.

721
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.300

722
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.500

723
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.000

724
