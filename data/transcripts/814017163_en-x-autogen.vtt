00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.800
if

2
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.500
See you church. Happy April. Does that mean it's officially spring

3
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.100
now? I think maybe we'll see in the next couple weeks.

4
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.500
But if you hear last week, you know that we kicked off

5
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.700
a really brief sermon series on this

6
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.000
idea of helping us see how

7
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.400
the gospels which again are the first four books the New

8
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.000
Testament help us believe in Jesus.

9
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.400
How does how does those four books

10
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.100
help us believe? We saw that each one of them

11
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.300
were written not just as biographies about

12
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.300
Jesus, but they were written as gospel accounts of

13
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.200
Jesus's life death and

14
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.800
Resurrection in the place of Sinners Like You and Me.

15
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.400
Not just biograph.

16
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
IES, they are gospel accounts. And so last week

17
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.400
we looked at Matthews account of the gospel and

18
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
this week. We're going to look at marks viewpoint on the

19
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
gospel. And so take your copy of God's word if you're not already there

20
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.300
and turn with me to The Gospel According to

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.000
mark

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.400
Will be a chapter 16 to start with so you

23
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.900
can go all the way to the end of Mark.

24
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.400
And we're going to get there in a moment.

25
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.100
but as you're turning it, let me remind you of something that I talked

26
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
to you, especially kids and students last week, but really all of

27
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.200
us that this Study last week this week and next

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.300
week May challenge you

29
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.400
at times it's gonna feel like an upper level course and

30
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.900
you're gonna have to have to think a little bit more than maybe before

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.500
but but really how we're supposed to understand God's

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.700
word is the point the focus of this. I know

33
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.300
you can handle it. I know we can step up to that

34
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.000
as we go forward.

35
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.800
But whether this is new information for you or not.

36
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.800
the point

37
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.800
of all of this

38
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.200
Even listen even if you've doubted this stuff.

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.000
You haven't believed you're just like are this all is just a

40
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.200
lot of hogwash. No, this is this is the point of

41
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.900
this is to reawaken our hearts.

42
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400
To see that that The Wonder of

43
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.300
the gospel and the Wonder and depth of God's grace for

44
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.300
us is true and it's worthy of Our

45
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.800
Lives.

46
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.900
to help us believe

47
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.400
And so to get there last week, we had to start a journey

48
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.600
into the nature of these first four books than Testament.

49
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.200
Like how did we even get them? Like these good news

50
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.100
accounts. We call the gospels. What are they? What is it

51
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100
mean to be a gospel?

52
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.500
We saw that their eyewitness testimonies to Jesus's life.

53
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.800
Now now as we looked at them, we saw the diverse, right? These are individuals

54
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
writing with angles and focuses.

55
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.500
But they all have a thread that cohesively runs

56
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500
through all of them.

57
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.400
So the gospel truth those core elements about who Jesus is and

58
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.900
what he's done and and we saw that the Holy Spirit inspired each

59
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.600
of those uniquely so that we are not

60
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.800
so that we're confused so that we have a deeper and richer portrait

61
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.300
of Jesus.

62
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.400
And we learn more and see who he is and we're challenged and

63
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.300
encouraged by the Gospels.

64
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.900
We're going to study Mark in that way today.

65
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.100
Now I said it last week at times. We're gonna

66
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.400
get kind of technical in these sermons.

67
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.600
This is one of those times about to Wade in to a

68
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.200
little bit of technicalities on some things but even as I

69
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.600
say that

70
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.200
I know that some of you showed up today and just like man, I just need some

71
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.800
encouragement.

72
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.300
I'm hurting my life is falling

73
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.900
apart and you're up there about to lecture us on textual criticism.

74
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.300
And I know that sounds like how is this even matter? Why does

75
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.800
this help me?

76
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.600
Why do we need to know these things? Why is this important?

77
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.600
Well, here's the reality.

78
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.300
For whatever reason in those circumstances of life

79
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.800
that push us to those places for whatever

80
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.100
reason we've taken our eyes off of

81
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.200
Jesus in those moments.

82
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.200
And we start looking around at our circumstances and we start

83
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.400
looking around it at these things being ultimate.

84
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.700
And it leads us to despair or or doubt or

85
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.500
trouble or whatever else and we we look at

86
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.000
those things way more than we look at Jesus

87
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.200
or maybe literally again, like you said, like I

88
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200
said before you walked in here, you don't even believe this stuff.

89
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.800
Okay. Well listen.

90
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.100
all of this

91
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.000
is to help you believe.

92
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.900
Everything about to talk about is to help you believe that

93
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.400
this is true and trustworthy. I

94
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.000
hope to give you some confidence today.

95
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.400
And if you don't believe this you can that if you do believe this

96
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.300
that you can stand firm.

97
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.000
That what you read here is true and trustworthy it tells

98
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.900
you who God really is and you can believe this.

99
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200
So what that is our foundation here's here's where we're

100
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.300
gonna get a little technical in mark.

101
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.200
You're at Mark 16. I want you to look.

102
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.500
closely Mark chapter 16

103
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.100
if you noticed right after verse 8

104
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.400
Pretty quickly into chapter 16 right after verse 8 now. This

105
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.300
is unless you have the King James version. This is not there. But but

106
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.200
it has in an insertion in there that says

107
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.400
something like some of the earliest manuscripts do

108
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.900
not include 16 9 through 20.

109
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.400
You see that?

110
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.000
And then there's there's double brackets around versus nine

111
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.300
through 20. Now. The question is

112
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.100
why is that?

113
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.300
Some of you have never even seen it that's

114
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.600
there before.

115
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.300
Well to understand what this is intending. We

116
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.900
need to understand first how we even received what

117
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.100
we have in God's word.

118
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.100
Next we're gonna get back into to how did we even get this?

119
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.100
Especially the New Testament. How did we

120
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.000
get this?

121
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.400
Well, as people were recording things like this

122
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.100
and Mark marks writing these things down. They were translating the

123
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.700
generally spoken Aramaic around them into

124
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.300
Greek as they wrote it down.

125
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.700
Now again, any translation is interpretation

126
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.400
in itself. And so we can trust as they

127
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.000
were doing that the Holy Spirit was superintending

128
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.300
even that as well. So

129
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.500
we know that that God was having him right down what he

130
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.300
wanted to communicate right? So it's not just

131
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.000
that because we don't have Aramaic it's not right. It's also right

132
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.100
that way.

133
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.100
unfortunately

134
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.800
We don't have any of those original manuscripts.

135
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.900
That's what those documents that they're writing down. We call a manuscripts manuscripts

136
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.100
and so we don't have any of

137
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.300
those.

138
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.700
anymore

139
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.500
thankfully though.

140
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.300
Once that original or those Originals of any

141
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.900
of these books began to be circulated.

142
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.500
Describes would make copies for safe keeping and

143
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.900
for wider distribution.

144
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.300
Here's the problem though 2,000 years ago. They couldn't just go to FedEx Office and

145
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.300
start making copies of it.

146
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.400
A copyist had to hand write with

147
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.100
quill and ink on parchment. They had to

148
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.800
hand write it all out.

149
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.100
So think about that as you're writing something in school

150
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.500
or writing a letter which a few people still do now, right? Like

151
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.200
you're riding it you're gonna make mistakes. You're gonna be slips. There's

152
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.300
gonna be things that you don't copy exactly over right that would

153
00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.900
happen.

154
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.800
That's why when we talk about the inerrancy of

155
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.300
God's word.

156
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.400
We're talking strictly speaking about

157
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.500
the original manuscripts.

158
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.400
Those things that were originally written were without

159
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.200
error as God intended wanted them to be

160
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200
written down.

161
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.400
Now I know as soon as I say that.

162
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.200
The minds are going where you're thinking like. Okay, well.

163
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.300
Well, does that mean what we have now is not God's word because

164
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.500
if that's if that was inerrancy, this is not an errancy. So

165
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.300
so listen, I'm not trying to create doubt.

166
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.400
About God's word.

167
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.600
Because what you might be thinking is alright, so there's Originals then

168
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.200
there's copies and you're thinking of that telephone game that

169
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.100
you played when you were in elementary school where somebody Whispers a

170
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.300
phrase to one person like, hey, the elephant

171
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.300
is sleeping and then they whisper it and they whisper it

172
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.200
and they whisper it all the way around the circle and somehow it comes out on the other end like

173
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.000
the semi truck ran off the road. Like, I don't know how that happens.

174
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.200
But it does right and so, you know, you're thinking okay if they're making

175
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200
copies and there were errors along the way then what we

176
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.400
have is all out of control. No.

177
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.200
Here's how we can trust.

178
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.800
That what we have here.

179
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.000
Faithfully represents the originals

180
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.900
see over the centuries archaeologists have discovered thousands

181
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.900
of copies of these

182
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.000
documents.

183
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.400
Many of them look just like this you'll see the picture on

184
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.800
the screen.

185
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.400
And their parchment they're not made of paper. Like we

186
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.300
have there's different types of papers throughout the history of

187
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.400
the world and parchment was one of them. So what

188
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.100
they do with those is they date those documents closer

189
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.800
and closer back to the original documents

190
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.000
and then they have so many

191
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.100
they cross-check them for accuracy and they see

192
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.100
well this one over here we found in Libya says this this one in Syria

193
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.200
says this and they cross-check them and

194
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200
what they found is that of the ancient authentic copies.

195
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.600
They've discovered they match over 99%

196
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.200
Over 99% of the authentic ancient manuscripts.

197
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.900
They're finding they match.

198
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.100
In fact many more manuscripts exist

199
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.200
for the New Testament than for any other

200
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.300
ancient writings out there.

201
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.100
Just for example.

202
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.400
There are over 5,600 early

203
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.300
New Testament Greek manuscripts.

204
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.800
While there are only seven of Plato's

205
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.100
writings.

206
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.000
5600 of Greek New

207
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.300
Testament seven

208
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.200
of Plato's writings

209
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.800
Along with that. There's over 19,000 copies in

210
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.400
Syriac Latin Coptic and Aramaic languages.

211
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.000
Not just the Greek. Those were again copies in different languages.

212
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.200
That's over 24,000 supporting

213
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.500
manuscripts.

214
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.000
We even have a copy of the fragment of

215
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.400
the copy of the Gospel according to

216
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:16.800
John.

217
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.700
That dates back to about 29 years

218
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.600
from when John would have originally written it

219
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.600
down in the late first century 29

220
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.500
years that's unheard of

221
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.900
in any other ancient text.

222
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.500
What that does though? Is it verifies the

223
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.800
authenticity of that copy? Because 29 years

224
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.200
means somebody would have been alive to have read

225
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:43.700
the original.

226
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.100
And if they see the copy is messed up in some

227
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.700
way. They might hold up. No. No, that's not what John wrote.

228
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.400
And they would have been able to point out and complain about the the inaccuracy of

229
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.600
the copy. And so you see how that saying what that

230
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.400
copy says if it's 29 years man, that's

231
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.100
that's verifying.

232
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.800
compare that to Homer's Iliad

233
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.300
Where the closest copy from the original is 500 years

234
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:10.600
later.

235
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.300
But we sure don't question. Its reliability as much

236
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.800
do we

237
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.000
so again

238
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.900
what I'm saying with all of this.

239
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.400
Is that we can trust that what we have

240
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.800
is God's word.

241
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.500
We can believe that God providentially ensured

242
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.300
the transmission of his

243
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.600
word just as much as he did the initial writing

244
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:40.900
of it.

245
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.500
That's really important for us so we can believe right.

246
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.800
If you notice though, I did not say 100% agreement

247
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.300
among the manuscripts.

248
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.900
99.5% is what

249
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.800
we have and so are there some differences

250
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.300
when they find this one over here and this one over here and this one from

251
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.500
this year and and they they look at those are there some differences?

252
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.100
Yes.

253
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.000
But hear me those differences are very minor.

254
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.300
They're often dealing with like a missing letter or

255
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.900
missing word and or a plural versus singular and

256
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.200
this copy and and you start to

257
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.300
see well, maybe This coffee's just kind of missed that word things that

258
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.200
don't affect theological principles in

259
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.500
any way.

260
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.300
Right when you look at your Bible, you'll see at the bottom. There's probably

261
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.600
footnotes down there.

262
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.400
And that's where you'll see stuff like that.

263
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.300
Well certain manuscripts say this word or that word,

264
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.400
but you read it. You're like that doesn't affect anything in our faith actually.

265
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.700
It's just there.

266
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.100
There are only two big sections in the

267
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.800
New Testament where there's substantial disagreement.

268
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.900
The double brackets here in Mark 16 is one of those.

269
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.100
The other one is in John chapter 8 with the woman caught in adultery. That's

270
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.500
another section that's similar to this.

271
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.400
And so what we're going to get to do today?

272
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.700
I set the foundation that we're going to do is we're gonna see how that reception of

273
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.500
God's word develops here and Mark.

274
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.500
Like that that reality of what we've seen with manuscripts

275
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.400
and how to do it all like then we're gonna get see it happen here

276
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.800
in Mark see an example of it of what we do

277
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.300
because remember what did it say here some of

278
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.500
the earliest manuscripts do not include 16 9 through

279
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.300
20. Now, you know what that's saying, right?

280
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.700
Some of the ones they found from the earliest dating they

281
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.800
could find they don't have 16 9

282
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.100
through 20.

283
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.900
Okay, but that leads the question. Why would some

284
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.200
copies later apparently include this

285
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.200
section?

286
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.300
well, because if you end the

287
00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.100
book with verse 8

288
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.100
It ends pretty a pretty suddenly.

289
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.300
So here's where we're at in the the story the women

290
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.300
have come to the tomb the they noticed that

291
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.100
the The Rock's been rolled away that Jesus body is

292
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.900
not there an angel shows up and says, hey Jesus is actually alive go

293
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.900
to Galilee and he'll meet you there.

294
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.800
We'll look at verse 8, Matthew or Mark 6:16.

295
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.500
And they went out the women they went out and fled

296
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.400
from the tomb for trembling and astonishment had

297
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.700
seized them and they said nothing to anyone for they

298
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.100
were afraid.

299
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.700
You see how abrupt that would be like, that's it.

300
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.200
That's why somebody's looking to this like surely. There's got to be something else, right?

301
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.300
But again, the earliest manuscripts do oddly end

302
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.900
it like that.

303
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.200
It is kind of an odd ending right in verse

304
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.600
8 ends with and they didn't tell anybody like so

305
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.400
so certainly we would think okay. That's why

306
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.400
either when the when copyist got that document. That's

307
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.500
why they thought okay. Well either we lost

308
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.400
Mark's original ending because certainly he

309
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.100
couldn't end it like that right either. We lost it somewhere along

310
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.300
the way.

311
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.200
Like hey, they forgot to staple the last page

312
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.300
of the document to go. Hey, here's the full thing. No that

313
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.600
either we lost it or more probably

314
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:27.900
this.

315
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.100
This is how Mark wanted to end it.

316
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.800
because listen

317
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200
Listen to how Mark.

318
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.600
began

319
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.400
Mark 1 verse 1 the beginning

320
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.200
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the son of

321
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:47.400
God

322
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.400
see what it says.

323
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.700
the beginning

324
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.100
that means chapter 16 is not the end of

325
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.700
the story.

326
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.700
That this is a beginning all

327
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.500
of Mark that he's written in one through 16 is

328
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.400
foundational for the rest of time for our

329
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.400
faith the gospel, but God's work

330
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.700
continues today, doesn't it?

331
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.500
And this was intended possibly by Mark to pull

332
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.900
us into the story.

333
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.100
To say okay. Well then what what do you

334
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.700
do with this information?

335
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.300
Apparently those some copious later.

336
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.300
They tried to smooth out the rough

337
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.100
edges of Mark 16 in the ending of it.

338
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.700
They felt was appropriate this this ending

339
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.600
here. Unfortunately, the longer ending

340
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.700
versus 9 through 20 is debatable.

341
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.100
Because in part it doesn't match the rest of

342
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.700
Mark.

343
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.500
It changes the tone as it speaks. It

344
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.600
repeats things. It probably wouldn't repeat if it

345
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.000
was original from Mark.

346
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.500
It has words used nowhere else in mark.

347
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.300
So we look at these verses and and we think like, okay.

348
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.600
Well that sure doesn't seem to match even further it claims

349
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.700
that Jesus said this this is Mark 16:17

350
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.200
and 18.

351
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.600
Jesus says these signs will accompany those

352
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.100
who believe.

353
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.500
In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak

354
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.100
in new tongues. They will pick up serpents with their

355
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.200
hands and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not

356
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.100
hurt them.

357
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.300
They will lay their hands on the sick and they

358
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:35.900
will recover.

359
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.800
By the way, if you have the King James version of the Bible

360
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.900
in your hands.

361
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.100
Which was translated into English in the year 1611.

362
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.700
It doesn't have the brackets.

363
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:54.600
Here's why?

364
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.000
Well, this is also why you'll see King James only churches practice

365
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.300
snake handling and drinking poison in their services.

366
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.500
It's because they hold this as authentic. This

367
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.700
is what Jesus said is going to happen for those who believe

368
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.400
again though. The problem is that the King

369
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.400
James version is based from 1611 on

370
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.900
later manuscripts.

371
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.200
Since they translated into English is 1611. We

372
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.500
found manuscripts that are earlier than what they used.

373
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.700
And they don't have this section.

374
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.500
Okay. So again.

375
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400
What do we do with this?

376
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.100
I'm not trying to end out induce got a doubt

377
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.600
in God's word here. That's not the goal of this today. We need

378
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.700
to be able to answer this question though.

379
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.000
So you're not reading through and you're doubting God's word as a

380
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.500
whole because of this section. What do we do with it?

381
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.300
Here's what One Pastor said about this section in Mark

382
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:57.500
16.

383
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.000
In spite of all these considerations of the likely unreliability

384
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.900
of this section.

385
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.500
Since it is possible to be wrong on the issue. It's good

386
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.100
to consider the meaning of this passage and leave it in the

387
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.200
text. Just like we do with John chapter 8.

388
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.400
Yet while for the most part summarizing truths

389
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.200
taught elsewhere in Scripture.

390
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.600
Meaning you can find the majority of 9 through 20 elsewhere and

391
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.500
scripture.

392
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.300
Verses 9 through 20 should always be compared with the

393
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.500
rest of scripture and no doctrines should

394
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.100
be formulated based solely on these verses.

395
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.400
That's what we do with this section.

396
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.100
Handle it carefully.

397
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.700
So there's part obviously here of chapter 16 that differs slightly

398
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.300
from the rest of the Gospels.

399
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.800
Mark in some small ways differs

400
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.000
from the other three

401
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.200
But I did it last week and I want to do it again this week

402
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.400
where where we highlight a couple of other ways that

403
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.800
Mark is different.

404
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.200
A couple other unique elements that Mark includes that

405
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.300
the other three gospels don't and why would Mark do

406
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:16.500
that?

407
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.400
We'll do it again next week with John.

408
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.900
But here's the first one just to the left in Mark chapter

409
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.300
15 verse 21 go over

410
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.200
there with me. Just turn one page to the left scroll up a little bit mark 15:21.

411
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.600
We're gonna look at this briefly. And again the scene

412
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.200
here. Is that Jesus remember as he was

413
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.500
arrested and tried he was then physically

414
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.900
unable to carry his own cross

415
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.400
because he had been beaten and tortured within

416
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.200
an inch of his life.

417
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.300
I mean it was it was almost deadly what they

418
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.100
did before they even got to the cross. And so that's where we are

419
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.400
right now. That's why this happens in verse 21

420
00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.700
of Mark 15.

421
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.200
They compelled a pastor by Simon of

422
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.600
Cyrene who was coming in from the country the father

423
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.100
of Alexander and Rufus to carry Jesus's

424
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.000
cross.

425
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.400
Now here's the thing. The other gospels mentioned that

426
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.300
Simon carries Jesus cross. That's that's not

427
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.100
unique to Mark. What's unique is the mention of

428
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.800
Simon's Sons Alexander and Rufus.

429
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.600
Nobody else mentions them and Mark writes

430
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.300
it as if his readers would know

431
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.500
Alexander and Rufus.

432
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.700
Like oh, yeah those guys remember Alexander, you know them right? He's mentioning

433
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.000
them as if they would know them. By the way,

434
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.600
it's likely the same Rufus that Paul mentions

435
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.100
in Romans chapter 16 verse 13 where

436
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.600
he says greet Rufus to the Roman Church

437
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.700
greet Rufus chosen in the Lord also his mother

438
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.800
who's been a mother to me as well.

439
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.300
So Paul knows Rufus Mark's readers

440
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.200
know Rufus. So here's what happened in

441
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.300
Mark 15. This is digging in a little bit deeper to this

442
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:08.900
one verse.

443
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.700
Here's what happened.

444
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.900
When Simon was forced to carry jesus' cross.

445
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.300
God put Simon face to face with the

446
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.300
one who could carry his sins.

447
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.100
We don't know if Simon new Jesus before this moment or not, but he is

448
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.500
having to carry the cross and he's looking right at Jesus.

449
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.900
But what happened as a result?

450
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.200
It's clear that Simon believed right?

451
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.100
Not only he believed but he goes home and he tells

452
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.400
his wife and he tells his sons about this Jesus that

453
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.300
he got to carry the cross for and he says I couldn't do

454
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.600
anything but no that that's the savior of the world and so his whole

455
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.400
family then comes to faith in Christ and

456
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.800
that family then we see in Romans 16 gives

457
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.600
their lives for the church for

458
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.500
the rest of their lives.

459
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.400
That that's Simon's wife rufus's mom.

460
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.500
His is a mom to Paul.

461
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.800
Serving caring loving him like he

462
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.900
is her own son.

463
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.600
And Mark here included their names so

464
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.600
that people could confirm these things

465
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.500
that Mark's writing down.

466
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.600
Right because think about Alexander Rufus as they were around the disciples

467
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.100
early in the church as they were around Paul clearly.

468
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.400
Like they would have been asking questions. They would have known that what Mark

469
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.200
was writing is absolutely true.

470
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.600
It's worthy of being trusted. It's worthy of being believed.

471
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.800
I mean to us we just skate over that stuff, right?

472
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.600
We don't even read it. It's such a minor detail, but Mark wanted his

473
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.800
readers to believe right?

474
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.200
He wanted his readers to be certain of this account of

475
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.700
Jesus. And so he's like guys if you doubt this stuff go ask Alexander

476
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.800
and Rufus they know.

477
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.600
Like they were maybe there we don't know.

478
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.900
But they know this is true.

479
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.300
God was continuing to oversee the spread of his

480
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:16.900
gospel.

481
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.800
That it was true. It was right. It's trustworthy.

482
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.400
One more place. I want to take you in Mark. It's just another page

483
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.900
to the left. Keep going a little bit further scroll up

484
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.700
to the left chapter 14.

485
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.600
Will be in verses 51 and 52 of Mark 14

486
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.400
again. These are unique moments in Mark that

487
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.700
no one else in the gospels includes.

488
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.200
Now we keep going back in time. So the scene here is

489
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.600
the night before Jesus was crucified.

490
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.700
This is in the Garden of Gethsemane.

491
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.600
Jesus had just eaten his Passover meal with his disciples washed their

492
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.300
feet. Then he takes them out to the Garden here.

493
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.200
to pray together

494
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.600
Jesus knows what's about to come?

495
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.300
And so he needs to pray.

496
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.700
That Garden is also where Judas betrayed Jesus.

497
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.300
Where Judas gave Jesus over to the crowd

498
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.600
and the guard to be arrested and tried and eventually crucified like

499
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.900
we saw with Simon scene.

500
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.200
I'm going to start reading up in verse 48 though.

501
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.900
This is Jesus responding to judas's betrayal.

502
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.100
To the crowd clamoring for Jesus.

503
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.500
Look at verse 48. Jesus said to them. Have you come out

504
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.300
as against a robber?

505
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.300
With swords and clubs to capture

506
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:41.500
me.

507
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.400
Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching and

508
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.000
yet you did not seize me.

509
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.400
But let the scriptures be fulfilled.

510
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.500
This is all prophetic. This is not an accident.

511
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.300
So that's how Jesus responded but but look

512
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.600
at how the disciples responded to the crowd though.

513
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.300
verse 50

514
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.600
and they all left him.

515
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.100
fled

516
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.000
it's his disciples. They

517
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.500
now that's in the other gospels that that the crowd shows

518
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.600
up. Jesus gets betrayed.

519
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.500
Peter might have used a sword to cut a guy's

520
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.400
ear off, but but eventually they all ran.

521
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.700
They all fled they left him they abandoned him.

522
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.200
That's in the other gospels, but look.

523
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.500
At what we see in verses 51 and 52. This

524
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.500
part is unique to mark

525
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.300
and a young man followed him.

526
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.700
With nothing, but a linen cloth about his body.

527
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.900
And they the guards seized him.

528
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.300
But he left the linen cloth and ran away

529
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.000
naked.

530
00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:58.900
What?

531
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.800
Like this thing's so serious and you're all feeling it for so long, right? Oh, just

532
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.000
seriously talk about the Gospels.

533
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.600
and then this

534
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.400
What in the world is going on here? Why is that even in

535
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.000
here? First of all?

536
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.800
It's almost like the disciples are sitting around years later. There's

537
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.300
like hey, remember the naked guy and I just laughing at

538
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:23.500
each other.

539
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.700
What is this?

540
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.400
Why in the world would Mark include those two

541
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.200
verses nobody else did none of the other three gospels did but Mark

542
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.600
does.

543
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.100
Plus, how did it even know what happened?

544
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.600
Right, the guards wouldn't have told him.

545
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.400
Right, and there's there's no one else there because everybody

546
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.400
else had fled.

547
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.600
So, how does Mark know?

548
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.000
That's why I think this is.

549
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.200
My opinion I think Mark included this

550
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.100
because that was him.

551
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.200
I think that was Mark now. I can't know that for sure.

552
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.800
I'm not gonna die on that hill of course, but it's just interesting to think about. How did

553
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.500
this transmission happen? How did we get the stories? We

554
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.600
got in the Gospels?

555
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.700
Mark knew and he didn't really want to share that with him.

556
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.800
but it was

557
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.300
True but more importantly here more importantly than who it

558
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:17.300
was.

559
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.100
What Mark was doing here?

560
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.400
Was he was highlighting how everyone had

561
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.700
abandoned Jesus?

562
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.200
Like in his deepest moment of need.

563
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.400
Of course all the other gospels talk about all the disciples

564
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.400
fled, but then Mark is saying man this one

565
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.200
young man.

566
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.300
Right he tried.

567
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.200
He was he was Valiant. He gave another he like Jesus been arrested. Everybody else is

568
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.400
leaving. He's he's like, oh man, I'm gonna make I'm gonna stand with Jesus, but

569
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.100
then even he fled

570
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.700
remember all these disciples had just a few hours earlier

571
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.400
stood up and said to Jesus like I'll die with

572
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:01.700
you Jesus.

573
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.300
I'll go to the Cross I'll do whatever I'll do whatever it takes

574
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.700
to follow you. I am in on this. I am not leaving

575
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.100
you.

576
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.100
They all left.

577
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.500
Even this bold young man.

578
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.800
Stuck it out the furthest.

579
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.500
Even he left abandoning. Jesus to be alone.

580
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.400
with the guards

581
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.800
in his deepest moment of need

582
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.000
Listen, that's the question. I want to ask you today.

583
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.500
Remember why the Holy Spirit inspired marked to

584
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:43.800
write all this?

585
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.100
So that people would believe.

586
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.000
So that people would believe that Jesus is the Messiah savior

587
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.600
Christ. The son of God that he is who

588
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.500
he said he is.

589
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.500
That's why the holy spirit said Mark right this yet even as

590
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.600
he was writing it down.

591
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.000
Mark and the other disciples would have known how easy

592
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.800
it is to abandon that

593
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.000
same Jesus when times get hard.

594
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.500
Listen a lot of people today.

595
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.400
Have been duped into believing that when you follow Jesus,

596
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.800
everything's gonna work out really well for your life.

597
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.400
Like you're gonna have a perfect family.

598
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.600
All kinds of money you're gonna be healthy.

599
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.300
Almost like God is some kind of bank vault in

600
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.500
the sky that if you get the combination, right you're opening the

601
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.700
door and you get everything on the other side of it.

602
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.500
That's just not true.

603
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.800
and and sadly what happens if someone believes

604
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.100
that

605
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.800
as soon as things get dicey.

606
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.400
As soon as things don't go their way.

607
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.700
They bail.

608
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.100
And then blame him for it.

609
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.400
I think that's why Mark included these two unique elements

610
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.200
that he included.

611
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.300
Because he wanted to deeply challenge those

612
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.900
who have been reading his document back

613
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.200
then.

614
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.300
Like why did he include the the Simon's son

615
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.300
thing? Why did he include this this man running away

616
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.900
naked? Why did he include usage? Because he wanted to deeply

617
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.600
challenge those who have been reading it back then

618
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.600
because I'm sure people could have gone up to Rufus and

619
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.200
and they could have they could have seen these

620
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:48.400
guys.

621
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.200
In Rome, and they would have thought they would have

622
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.000
seen that that their life wasn't great.

623
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.500
Like imagine following Jesus in Rome back then right? Like they they

624
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.200
would have seen that Alexander and Rufus man. They didn't have it good

625
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.500
for the rest of their lives. They had to struggle. They were persecuted. There

626
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.600
was some difficult Seasons, they walked through even though

627
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.200
they believed

628
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.000
Along with that Mark includes this factoid in

629
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.400
the garden this one little tiny thing as

630
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.800
a way.

631
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.900
to remind himself

632
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.000
and to remind every other disciple the

633
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.100
price of turning away from Jesus.

634
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800
Right. Why would he put that in there?

635
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.000
Why would the Holy Spirit lead him to put that in there?

636
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.300
Now I know at the time they did not

637
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.300
understand the power of the Resurrection yet. They did not have the Holy Spirit

638
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.800
of God dwelling in them as Believers yet. So that changed everything

639
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.400
a few weeks later. When the Holy Spirit entered in

640
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.100
they became bold. They became unashamed. Yes, everything changed,

641
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.800
but they included this I think

642
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.200
Because they needed to feel the sting

643
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.100
of the time. They had previously abandoned

644
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.300
and denied Jesus in his greatest

645
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.800
time of need.

646
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.400
Like just think of the way they would have felt

647
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.900
every time they read this.

648
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:19.900
Because you remember.

649
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.800
You remember how we ran?

650
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.900
So Mark wanted to challenge his readers.

651
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.200
But hear me church, I believe that from 2,000 years ago

652
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.300
marks writing to us too as well. And

653
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.400
he wants to challenge us just as deeply

654
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.400
he asks us the same question.

655
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.100
Do you believe that Jesus lived died

656
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.800
and resurrected in your place for your

657
00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.300
salvation?

658
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.300
Do you believe that Jesus is your savior?

659
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.400
Listen if you don't yet.

660
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:09.900
then

661
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.300
I pray that you would see who he is.

662
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.600
And you would see that you can trust this talking about

663
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.200
him and you can turn to him in faith that he's done it

664
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.000
all for your salvation. I I pray that you would see that today.

665
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.900
But listen, if you do believe that

666
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.700
Jesus is the Risen Savior.

667
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.300
Like those women came to the tomb and they saw he's not there anymore.

668
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.600
The angel said he's alive. Do you believe that if you believe

669
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.100
that Jesus is your savior and

670
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.200
he is alive.

671
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.500
And why are you ashamed to stand for him?

672
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.600
Why do you run like the disciples did?

673
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.200
When things get a little dicey.

674
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.500
And then you somehow blame God for your pain.

675
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.500
Why do you abandon Jesus when the

676
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.600
angry mob comes your way?

677
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.700
Why why do we deny him

678
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.400
in the way? We live our lives that it's

679
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.400
no different than anybody out there who doesn't believe and it

680
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.500
looks no different.

681
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.100
Like maybe you need to see today that you're clinging

682
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.500
tighter to the things of this world. You're clinging

683
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.300
to security. There's a comfort or to pleasure.

684
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.300
Like maybe you're clinging more tightly to keeping

685
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.700
up your reputation than you are then worried about

686
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.600
the honor of Christ in your life.

687
00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.300
I mean, just think about this have you truly counted the

688
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.800
cost to follow Jesus?

689
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.900
Mark calls us to believe

690
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.300
he calls us to see this

691
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.300
unchanging God and he says trust him.

692
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.100
He says follow him. He's worthy of it.

693
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.400
That's how you persevere Church.

694
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.300
Listen, you're seeing this and you might be feeling this

695
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.300
weight creeping on your shoulders that you have to somehow come

696
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.100
up with the power yourself to say. Well, I've got

697
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.700
to stand strong for Jesus now, I guess. Okay, how can I drum that

698
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.300
up? Here we go.

699
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:41.700
now listen

700
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.800
as you just saw from the disciples.

701
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.600
You cannot do this on your own.

702
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.700
You cannot do this on your you're gonna run.

703
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.500
I will run.

704
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.900
We are not strong enough.

705
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.000
So, how do you persevere? How do you stand how do

706
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.700
you stay steadfast? How do you do this? Listen, the

707
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.900
way you do? This is by abiding in

708
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.100
Jesus. It's by immersing

709
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.900
yourself into this gospel. This

710
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.000
good news constantly because as

711
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.400
you do that he empowers you

712
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.700
to persevere.

713
00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.500
You look at this and you're like, there's no way that angry

714
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.500
mobs coming at me. I'm out really fast. Yes, that

715
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.200
is true. But you cannot forget this church.

716
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.500
You cannot forget the truth that Jesus lived the

717
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.100
life. You can't live in your place. He died the death

718
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.400
you deserved in your place. He resurrected to defeat sin

719
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.500
and death in your place. He did all of that for you.

720
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.500
So now it's not your job to come up with it yourself. It's your

721
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.400
job to rest in him. So he does it through you.

722
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.100
And so you stand there the angry mobs coming

723
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.400
your way. What do you do? You say Jesus? I desperately need

724
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.500
you and it gives you the power to stand.

725
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.800
That's what we're talking about here. That is what he

726
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.400
did to save us to redeem us

727
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.800
to sustain us. He did it all that's the

728
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.200
gospel truth that we hold dear.

729
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.600
But again, if that's true.

730
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:24.400
then

731
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.300
what else can we do but give it all back to

732
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:28.600
him?

733
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.800
To count Our Lives as nothing for the

734
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.000
sake of following him.

735
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.500
To say to Jesus. Here's my money. Here's my time.

736
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.800
Here's my friends. Here's my habits.

737
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.400
Here's my path. Here's my shame. Here's my

738
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.300
safety. Here's my sin. Here's my life.

739
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.200
Say to Jesus it's yours and

740
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.300
to say in a way even if standing with

741
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.500
you. Jesus means I die.

742
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.100
even if standing with you, Jesus means I get made fun of

743
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.500
it means I get taken advantage of it means

744
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.400
I lose.

745
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.800
Even if it means I don't have as much as I could otherwise,

746
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.900
whatever it is Jesus you are

747
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.800
worth it.

748
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.700
And I believe Jesus I believe.
