WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:19.175
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.095
It's great to see you. What a privilege.

3
00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:22.895
We have the freedom to be able

4
00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:24.215
to do this on a Sunday morning.

5
00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:25.375
We're so thankful for that.

6
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.095
Uh, my prayer has been that,

7
00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.935
that your eyes would be lifted up above the chaos

8
00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:34.495
of the world to see our true hope in our savior king.

9
00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:37.855
I don't know what brought you here this morning,

10
00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:40.295
but if you're new, we're so glad that you are here.

11
00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:41.935
We'd love to help you get connected to our church.

12
00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:43.295
There's a new here area in the lobby.

13
00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:45.255
Just go say hi out there or,

14
00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:47.655
or maybe you're, uh, may been here a few weeks,

15
00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:48.695
you're kind of kicking the tires.

16
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.855
Like, is this where I want to plug in as a church?

17
00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:53.575
Then we'd love to invite you next Sunday to

18
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:54.855
what we call next steps.

19
00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:57.695
And it's a good place for you to get to know our church.

20
00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:01.055
It runs every five weeks, so just kind of one through five,

21
00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:02.255
one through five, one through five.

22
00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:03.815
You can jump in at any point,

23
00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:06.055
but it just helps you understand who we are as a church,

24
00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:08.495
but also how to grow in your faith in really simple ways.

25
00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:10.615
And so if you're looking for a next step,

26
00:01:10.645 --> 00:01:12.415
that would be a great place for that.

27
00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:15.575
Also, church, just briefly, I want to let you know that we

28
00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.295
as elders are, are planning on starting a new elder class

29
00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:20.775
to add some more pastors

30
00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:23.095
to our council over the next couple of months.

31
00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:24.095
We wanna start that process.

32
00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:27.375
And so, uh, if you're a man who's feeling called towards

33
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.495
that and like, man, I just wanna explore that,

34
00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:30.575
please come talk to one of us.

35
00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.375
We'd love to explore that, kind of think through what

36
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.855
that looks like as we explore that together.

37
00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.935
So I just wanna let you know, and you can be praying

38
00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:41.815
for us in that, uh, today we are in week two

39
00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:45.095
of our new series through the book of Second Samuel.

40
00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.615
We're walking through this called the Promised King,

41
00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:50.335
and God promised a king.

42
00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:51.575
We found out that was David,

43
00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.335
but also how David points us forward to the true

44
00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:57.575
king Jesus Christ.

45
00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.105
As we get into it today, I wanna tell you about my journey,

46
00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.585
uh, that the Lord has taken me as a worshiper.

47
00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:09.065
So early on I would characterize myself as a board

48
00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:13.025
worshiper growing up in the church basically every Sunday my

49
00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:16.425
whole fixation was on Elaine playing the pipe organ,

50
00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:17.785
how she can play with both her hands

51
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.025
and her feet at the same time.

52
00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:21.505
It's wild. That's all I wanted

53
00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:24.585
to watch every Sunday until I got to college.

54
00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:26.185
And then I would consider myself

55
00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:30.945
what I would call an awakened worshiper newborn, uh,

56
00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:33.225
where you're just kind of at the age

57
00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:34.385
of 20, God will open my heart.

58
00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.265
God brought me to himself and,

59
00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.865
and it was just this sort of increasing awe and wonder, but,

60
00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:41.185
but stumbling through it,

61
00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:43.385
not really knowing much of anything.

62
00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:47.545
What that quickly led to though was what I would term

63
00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:50.865
an afraid of man worshiper,

64
00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.345
where I got really quickly into this mode of thinking

65
00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:57.785
and worrying about what you think about me

66
00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:01.485
and worrying about what other people think about me and,

67
00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:04.205
and struggling to obey in life

68
00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:05.925
because I didn't want you not to like me.

69
00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:09.725
And so then also just not expressive in worship.

70
00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:12.485
I was kind of just stuck in in that sense

71
00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:15.805
because I was really concerned about what others thought.

72
00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:19.445
Now I'm not afraid of that anymore,

73
00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:23.605
but here's the other ditch on that same road.

74
00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:26.845
It used to be afraid of man,

75
00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:31.265
but now it can turn into performing so

76
00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:35.565
that you like me, which just by the way shows how,

77
00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:39.685
how really sick our hearts actually are, if that's

78
00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.685
how we play this from one to the other.

79
00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.405
But gratefully, I can look back

80
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.285
and I can see how God has brought me down this road and,

81
00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:51.245
and I think he's used three specific things to deepen

82
00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.245
that lifestyle of worship in my heart.

83
00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:57.645
First, God has used seasons of waiting

84
00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:02.085
In my life that I've been forced to trust him

85
00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:04.045
through things and wait on him.

86
00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:06.965
It didn't happen right away, had to had to wait.

87
00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:10.045
And so he's used that to shape my worship

88
00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:11.525
and to trust him more.

89
00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:17.525
That's first. He's also increased my awe just

90
00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:20.285
through deepening my grasp of his holiness.

91
00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:23.045
Like just understanding more of God as you read his word

92
00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:26.005
and follow him like just overwhelmingly this sense

93
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:28.485
of stunned awe of who God is,

94
00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.405
which has then led to a deeper awakening

95
00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:35.935
to the joy of the gospel.

96
00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:39.695
That if that's who God is, then this is who I am

97
00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:41.095
and how far I am from him.

98
00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:45.815
But look at what he has done, awakening joy in my heart.

99
00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:49.375
And so God has combined all three of those things

100
00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:51.255
to expand my worship,

101
00:04:52.755 --> 00:04:56.335
to draw me towards obedience day to day

102
00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:01.895
and to set me on a path toward loud singing

103
00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:05.815
and loud living out there.

104
00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:08.425
God has used all of that.

105
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:09.705
And so what we're gonna see today,

106
00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:11.265
actually in two Samuel four

107
00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:14.145
through six is David's journey in a similar way.

108
00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:19.225
David's example, my prayer is that will move all of us down

109
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:22.265
that road towards worship.

110
00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.305
He's gonna show us how critical it is for us to wait on God

111
00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:28.545
to learn how to wait on God.

112
00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:31.145
'cause here's the thing, we don't like waiting on God.

113
00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:34.985
We don't like waiting for anything, let alone God

114
00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:37.825
for extended periods of time waiting on him to come through.

115
00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:39.265
We don't like it, but we have

116
00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:40.705
to if we're gonna flourish in life.

117
00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:46.585
But I think what we'll also see today is that many

118
00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:50.385
of us have lost our awe of God

119
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:54.975
and we just kind of get bored with him.

120
00:05:56.215 --> 00:05:59.605
And we're so casual in how we approach

121
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:01.885
the Lord of the universe.

122
00:06:04.535 --> 00:06:08.085
We'll see it. And so I pray that God's word will hit reset

123
00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:12.645
for us today in a lot of ways that it would prompt,

124
00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:16.805
faithful, joyful worship in response.

125
00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:19.285
Lord, we ask you to do that.

126
00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:21.085
This is your word, it's not mine.

127
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:26.235
Speak through it Holy Spirit, apply it

128
00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:28.475
to our hearts uniquely each one in this room.

129
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:33.075
It's very different. Apply it lead us in the way

130
00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:35.375
of lasting in Jesus' name.

131
00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:39.695
Amen. So take your copy of God's word, turn with me

132
00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:41.135
to two Samuel four

133
00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.655
and go through three chapters again.

134
00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:48.215
So we'll just kind of bounce through it a little bit.

135
00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:51.215
But we're gonna start in verse one of two Samuel four.

136
00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:56.465
This is a bit of a recap kind

137
00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:58.745
of catching us up in the story if you, if you miss it,

138
00:06:58.745 --> 00:06:59.905
we're just walking through this whole book.

139
00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:01.425
So if you miss a week, you can go back

140
00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:03.825
and listen to that to make sure you stay up with the story.

141
00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:08.785
But look at verse one, when ish Boche

142
00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:13.625
Saal son heard that Abner had died at he, his courage failed

143
00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.705
and all Israel was dismayed.

144
00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:22.225
Now remember Israel Sheth was Saul's other son

145
00:07:22.845 --> 00:07:25.585
who Abner had set up as king of Israel,

146
00:07:26.055 --> 00:07:27.985
even though David was anointed King of Israel.

147
00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:30.305
Abner said, no, Israel Sheth is, and

148
00:07:30.305 --> 00:07:33.505
and he was in kind of contrast civil war like to David

149
00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:36.105
reigning in Judah at Hebron.

150
00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:38.425
And, and so there's this, this battle

151
00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:40.345
that was set up because of that.

152
00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:44.505
But then remember Abner defected to David and he came over

153
00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:46.625
and, and Abner said, I'm with you David,

154
00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:49.065
but David's general Joab didn't like that.

155
00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:50.705
And so Joab killed

156
00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:55.465
and so ish Bhe is feeling pretty alone at this point.

157
00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:58.945
He's seeing the writing on the wall,

158
00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:00.545
all these guys are leaving.

159
00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:02.105
Things are tough.

160
00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:05.905
And so I, I don't know, am I gonna make it or not?

161
00:08:07.735 --> 00:08:11.015
Well The rest of chapter four is nearly identical

162
00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:13.775
to the story that we saw last week with Saul.

163
00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:16.255
If you remember Saul, there was a man

164
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:17.855
who thought he was gonna impress David.

165
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:21.215
So he goes and takes Saul out and comes back

166
00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:24.095
and says, Hey David, I killed Saul.

167
00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:26.535
And well David had him executed.

168
00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:27.735
It's nearly an identical thing.

169
00:08:27.755 --> 00:08:31.215
Two guys go and execute Ishbel Sheth, come back to David

170
00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:32.695
and say, Hey David, I got your enemy.

171
00:08:32.715 --> 00:08:34.735
Aren't you pleased? No,

172
00:08:36.235 --> 00:08:39.335
he brought God's judgment on them in return.

173
00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:42.295
But here's why all that's important.

174
00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:45.895
Chapter four is getting us to chapter five.

175
00:08:47.605 --> 00:08:51.135
Like as we move into chapter five, all that matters

176
00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:55.365
because now the pathway is finally fully open

177
00:08:55.745 --> 00:08:59.845
for David to step into the kingship of all

178
00:08:59.845 --> 00:09:01.405
of God's people, not just Judah.

179
00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:03.165
Now all of Israel

180
00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:05.445
and even the people start to see this,

181
00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:06.525
they start to acknowledge it.

182
00:09:06.525 --> 00:09:09.645
Look at chapter five now verses one

183
00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:09.885
and two,

184
00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:18.115
then all the tribes of Israel came to David at he

185
00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:20.515
and said, behold, we are your bone and flesh.

186
00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:24.355
We are your family. In times past when Saul was king over

187
00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:27.515
us, it was you David who led out and brought in Israel.

188
00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:30.355
And the Lord said to you, you shall be shepherd

189
00:09:30.415 --> 00:09:34.635
of my people Israel and you shall be prince over Israel.

190
00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:40.795
Now that is something, if you remember, we saw God say

191
00:09:40.855 --> 00:09:43.985
to David 20 years

192
00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:47.965
earlier, right?

193
00:09:47.985 --> 00:09:49.645
God anointed David as the king.

194
00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:51.885
Even when Saul was still the king, David was anointed king.

195
00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:56.085
And God said to David, you will be king over my people.

196
00:09:58.255 --> 00:10:01.065
That was 20 years earlier

197
00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:06.935
through all the wilderness though, all the trials,

198
00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:09.215
all the exile, the caves,

199
00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:11.575
the threats coming on David's life here,

200
00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:16.145
it was finally fulfilled After all that time,

201
00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:18.225
after all that journey, it was finally fulfilled.

202
00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:20.505
The shepherd boy had become the shepherd king.

203
00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:24.765
God's design is always perfect.

204
00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:29.045
We're gonna put up that chart again.

205
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.405
This is the overview of two Samuel.

206
00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:32.405
We'll use it most every week.

207
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.565
And so if you miss it, you'll be able

208
00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:36.085
to catch it again some other time.

209
00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:37.845
But, but here's what it's showing.

210
00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.525
It's showing that we are just into that second phase where

211
00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:43.165
God has moved David and the kingship

212
00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:47.125
and the throne from Hebrew now to Jerusalem, seven

213
00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:51.765
and a half years in He now 33 years in Jerusalem.

214
00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:54.905
And that's important to know

215
00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:57.385
because that was the place God had picked for his,

216
00:10:58.205 --> 00:10:59.785
his temple, his place.

217
00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:03.305
But it's not just that he moved David there.

218
00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:06.265
What we start to see also, this is verse 10 of chapter five,

219
00:11:06.555 --> 00:11:09.625
David became greater and greater for the Lord.

220
00:11:09.845 --> 00:11:12.545
The God of hosts was with him.

221
00:11:13.885 --> 00:11:18.625
The blessing of God on David again anointed 20 years

222
00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:20.225
earlier, he's finally the king.

223
00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:22.905
Now God is with him because his heart is for him.

224
00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:26.105
And so now we see it finally come to pass.

225
00:11:28.345 --> 00:11:33.325
Here's the point. The way David handled those

226
00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:36.355
20 years shows us

227
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:38.715
that we are to worship.

228
00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:41.555
As we wait on God.

229
00:11:44.275 --> 00:11:46.765
Worship occurs as we wait.

230
00:11:48.085 --> 00:11:51.415
It's not just we'll worship later, it's worship as we wait

231
00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:56.165
patiently in the middle, it's worship.

232
00:11:58.055 --> 00:12:01.685
Psalm 37, verse seven says, be still before the Lord

233
00:12:01.785 --> 00:12:04.125
and wait patiently for him.

234
00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:12.395
How hard is that though? Right? Our flesh

235
00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:15.955
chafes at the slowness of God's clock.

236
00:12:17.465 --> 00:12:19.515
Like we don't wanna wait for anything,

237
00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:21.155
let alone wait 20 years

238
00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.275
to fulfill the promise that God had made.

239
00:12:25.755 --> 00:12:28.215
But notice something, the waiting, the 20 years

240
00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.335
of waiting didn't make David bitter.

241
00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:35.785
It made David better. It refined him.

242
00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:37.665
And we watched his journey through one Samuel,

243
00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:40.785
how God was refining him and testing him and growing him.

244
00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:43.905
That was in preparation for this moment.

245
00:12:49.025 --> 00:12:50.975
Maybe for you it's waiting on a spouse

246
00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:57.825
where you know you, you gratefully haven't made it an idol.

247
00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:02.805
You, you have a good desire, but you're still waiting.

248
00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:07.455
Just ask the question, what is God

249
00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:08.495
doing in your heart right now?

250
00:13:09.365 --> 00:13:10.375
What Is he doing in you

251
00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:13.615
to prepare you regardless of the end?

252
00:13:13.765 --> 00:13:15.215
What is he doing in you right now?

253
00:13:19.525 --> 00:13:21.425
Or maybe you're waiting on a resolution

254
00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:27.185
to your health issues or to a, a relationship struggle

255
00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:28.905
and it's just taken longer than you thought it

256
00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:29.945
would and you can't get any answers.

257
00:13:29.965 --> 00:13:31.025
And all this seven years waiting,

258
00:13:31.165 --> 00:13:32.665
what's God doing in the middle of it?

259
00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:36.625
Look to the Lord, worship him as you wait

260
00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:41.755
or you're waiting on a job that aligns with your values.

261
00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:42.915
You've had a couple opportunities,

262
00:13:42.975 --> 00:13:44.555
but you think, man, those are unethical

263
00:13:44.655 --> 00:13:48.395
and you're just waiting on God's right one to align with

264
00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:49.395
what you are about

265
00:13:49.735 --> 00:13:52.755
and you watch the savings dwindle in the process.

266
00:13:55.765 --> 00:13:57.245
You're waiting. What do you do with that?

267
00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.445
You look to the Lord, ask the question,

268
00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:00.645
what is God doing in my heart?

269
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.245
What does he need to refine in me?

270
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:05.125
How is he working in me as I wait,

271
00:14:07.635 --> 00:14:09.255
I'm gonna show you a video of a story

272
00:14:09.275 --> 00:14:11.415
of someone in our church that has been worshiping

273
00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:14.295
as they wait for something very specific.

274
00:14:14.415 --> 00:14:15.415
Watch this.

275
00:14:18.845 --> 00:14:21.885
I think during these periods of waiting, God has taught me

276
00:14:22.735 --> 00:14:26.265
that he's trustworthy and that he's faithful.

277
00:14:34.215 --> 00:14:36.865
Well, my name's Melissa Medo. Um, I'm married to Rob.

278
00:14:36.915 --> 00:14:38.825
We've been married for 18 years.

279
00:14:39.765 --> 00:14:43.985
Um, our kids are Annie who is 14, Ann Maddox is 12.

280
00:14:45.535 --> 00:14:49.105
Well, like any parent, you want your child to know the Lord.

281
00:14:49.245 --> 00:14:50.945
Any, like any Christian parent, I guess I should,

282
00:14:51.045 --> 00:14:52.685
I should say you want your child to know the Lord.

283
00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:55.645
And so, um, you know, you just kind

284
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.325
of wait, you see it happen.

285
00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:59.165
Um, in kids who are younger,

286
00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.285
you see it happen in kids who are older.

287
00:15:01.645 --> 00:15:03.245
I always prayed for her salvation,

288
00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:05.445
but I really started praying a lot in middle school.

289
00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:07.685
I was like, Lord, please draw her to you.

290
00:15:07.985 --> 00:15:10.605
And um, I caught myself.

291
00:15:10.965 --> 00:15:12.085
I didn't realize that at the time,

292
00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:14.485
but I was kind of trying to manipulate things

293
00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:18.245
and do them for her, which sounds really silly, I know.

294
00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:22.525
Um, but I, you know, would think, oh, if I can just get her

295
00:15:22.525 --> 00:15:23.925
to go to this student event

296
00:15:23.985 --> 00:15:27.765
or get her to hang out with these people, then maybe that's,

297
00:15:27.765 --> 00:15:29.525
maybe then she'll know she needs Jesus.

298
00:15:29.905 --> 00:15:33.085
It was just my mom mind working overtime, trying like,

299
00:15:33.245 --> 00:15:35.125
'cause I know everyone needs the Lord.

300
00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:38.285
And one day in the fall of 2023,

301
00:15:38.825 --> 00:15:41.765
the Lord very clearly told me, stop striving.

302
00:15:41.955 --> 00:15:44.725
I've got her. And I thought, okay,

303
00:15:44.915 --> 00:15:45.925
Lord, was that really you?

304
00:15:46.185 --> 00:15:47.805
He first told me through the Holy Spirit

305
00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:50.685
and then in the following weeks he used three different

306
00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.445
lectures by three different teachers.

307
00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:56.325
They all used the word striving in their lectures.

308
00:15:57.545 --> 00:16:00.485
And so I was like, okay Lord, I hear you.

309
00:16:00.705 --> 00:16:03.005
And so that was a promise I knew that he made to me.

310
00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:06.045
And I just had to hang on to that promise

311
00:16:06.045 --> 00:16:10.205
because there were some um, there was a lot of dark days.

312
00:16:12.285 --> 00:16:14.925
I kept having to tell myself, it's not my responsibility,

313
00:16:15.035 --> 00:16:18.765
it's my responsibility to model things for her,

314
00:16:18.865 --> 00:16:20.805
to talk about the Lord, to bring her to church,

315
00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:23.165
but I can't save her.

316
00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:26.285
When we picked her up at Canac Cook this summer, um,

317
00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:28.965
we are always anticipating a big work

318
00:16:29.025 --> 00:16:31.485
by God while she's at camp.

319
00:16:32.185 --> 00:16:35.925
And she was more talkative, more happy to see us.

320
00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:39.565
Um, definitely just had kind of a peace about her.

321
00:16:39.905 --> 00:16:43.645
And so I enjoyed that thinking. Oh, she softened a little.

322
00:16:44.025 --> 00:16:47.085
So we picked her up on a Friday, that following Sunday

323
00:16:47.175 --> 00:16:49.405
after church, she came out with a group,

324
00:16:49.415 --> 00:16:50.645
group of friends crying.

325
00:16:51.265 --> 00:16:53.485
And she told me that she had accepted

326
00:16:54.265 --> 00:16:57.485
Christ at Canuck at a night they call crosstalk.

327
00:16:58.265 --> 00:17:00.445
And I just had immediate tears.

328
00:17:02.825 --> 00:17:05.485
We were in the midst of a really difficult summer.

329
00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:10.245
And hearing that she finally had come

330
00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:14.045
to salvation was such a relief and such a gift.

331
00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:18.045
And this whole time he was working behind the scenes.

332
00:17:18.565 --> 00:17:20.125
I mean, I was like, yes, Lord,

333
00:17:20.285 --> 00:17:22.805
a a promise fulfilled like here it is.

334
00:17:22.915 --> 00:17:25.725
I've been waiting. I've been hanging onto your

335
00:17:25.725 --> 00:17:27.165
promise that you've got her.

336
00:17:27.425 --> 00:17:30.365
And here it is. I think during these periods of waiting,

337
00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:33.485
God has taught me that he's trustworthy

338
00:17:34.905 --> 00:17:35.925
and that he's faithful.

339
00:17:37.025 --> 00:17:39.245
And that even though I don't understand

340
00:17:40.265 --> 00:17:42.045
why things aren't being done in my time,

341
00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:44.805
which is a big theme of my entire life,

342
00:17:44.925 --> 00:17:47.285
I always want everything done when I want it done

343
00:17:47.305 --> 00:17:48.485
and not waiting for God.

344
00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:50.205
But it's always worth it.

345
00:17:51.765 --> 00:17:54.725
I cannot imagine any other way for my daughter have to come

346
00:17:54.725 --> 00:17:58.165
to salvation than during this time in the summer

347
00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:01.645
whenever I was struggling and sad

348
00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:03.565
and just, you know, all of these things.

349
00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:06.965
And I get this gift of my daughter accepting Christ

350
00:18:07.585 --> 00:18:08.725
in the middle of a really,

351
00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:11.085
really hard season worth the wait every time.

352
00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:12.805
His timing is perfect.

353
00:18:17.355 --> 00:18:20.845
That may be your story could be something very different,

354
00:18:22.215 --> 00:18:25.845
maybe infertility, maybe it's family struggles.

355
00:18:26.725 --> 00:18:27.765
I don't know what it is. But listen,

356
00:18:27.765 --> 00:18:29.685
you're not the first one to have had to wait.

357
00:18:31.305 --> 00:18:35.765
You could even go back to Jesus spent 30 years in obscurity

358
00:18:35.765 --> 00:18:37.365
before God said, okay, now it's time.

359
00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:39.085
Father said, now it's time.

360
00:18:40.265 --> 00:18:41.645
But what happened even immediately

361
00:18:41.645 --> 00:18:44.485
as he walks into the ministry 40 days,

362
00:18:44.705 --> 00:18:45.885
he goes out in the wilderness

363
00:18:47.145 --> 00:18:51.485
and he has to wait fasting through no food, no water,

364
00:18:51.635 --> 00:18:53.965
tempted by Satan the whole time proving

365
00:18:54.505 --> 00:18:56.845
his faithfulness in his humanity.

366
00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:58.285
He was showing that.

367
00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:00.685
But he had to wait through that,

368
00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:07.215
which led to Hebrews five saying this, in the days

369
00:19:07.215 --> 00:19:09.175
of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers

370
00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:10.775
and supplications with loud cries

371
00:19:10.835 --> 00:19:13.815
and tears to him who was able to save him from death.

372
00:19:14.115 --> 00:19:16.215
And he was heard because of his reverence.

373
00:19:16.695 --> 00:19:18.735
Although he was a son, he learned obedience through

374
00:19:18.735 --> 00:19:21.935
what he suffered and being made perfect,

375
00:19:22.555 --> 00:19:24.655
he became the source of eternal salvation

376
00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:26.535
to all who obey him.

377
00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:30.775
Now, Jesus was always perfect,

378
00:19:31.155 --> 00:19:34.935
but what this is saying is that his saving role for us

379
00:19:35.635 --> 00:19:38.175
was proven as he waited through

380
00:19:38.475 --> 00:19:43.455
and overcame the enemy's temptations through his suffering.

381
00:19:43.635 --> 00:19:48.055
He said, I am worthy. I am the Savior.

382
00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:55.345
And so worship as you wait, worship

383
00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:58.545
as you wait, his delays are not his denials.

384
00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:03.905
His timing is perfect.

385
00:20:06.145 --> 00:20:10.565
He will always be with his children through whatever it is.

386
00:20:12.685 --> 00:20:16.865
And you can trust that he's growing your christlikeness

387
00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:20.905
through it no matter what you wait for.

388
00:20:24.455 --> 00:20:25.555
Now here's what happens though.

389
00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:26.755
When we are in that struggle,

390
00:20:29.215 --> 00:20:32.945
the temptation shows up for us to say,

391
00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:34.145
okay, I'm in the middle of the waiting.

392
00:20:34.165 --> 00:20:36.345
I'm in the struggle. I just gotta make it.

393
00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:41.705
And you get kind of tunnel vision on making it

394
00:20:41.985 --> 00:20:44.625
through the problem or the waiting game, whatever it is,

395
00:20:45.005 --> 00:20:49.165
and you kind of abandon and, and really devalue

396
00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:51.805
and think less of God and set him on the shelf

397
00:20:51.825 --> 00:20:52.845
or leave him behind because

398
00:20:52.845 --> 00:20:54.005
you're just like, I just gotta make it.

399
00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:57.885
This waiting is hard. I just gotta make it.

400
00:20:57.885 --> 00:21:00.805
And so we get flippant in our treatment of God

401
00:21:00.805 --> 00:21:03.445
because we're so focused on ourselves.

402
00:21:06.005 --> 00:21:10.215
Well here's why two Samuel chapter six is really

403
00:21:10.215 --> 00:21:11.415
important for us.

404
00:21:12.395 --> 00:21:15.655
It paints a picture of God that we must not trifle with.

405
00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:19.015
We must not set on the shelf, we cannot leave behind.

406
00:21:19.015 --> 00:21:21.775
Look at verses one through four of chapter six.

407
00:21:28.295 --> 00:21:31.285
David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, 30,000.

408
00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:33.565
And David arose and went with all the people who were

409
00:21:33.565 --> 00:21:36.205
with him from Baal Judah to bring up from there the Ark

410
00:21:36.205 --> 00:21:38.405
of God, which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts

411
00:21:38.405 --> 00:21:40.005
who sits enthroned on the cherub.

412
00:21:40.705 --> 00:21:42.805
And they carried the Ark of God on a new cart

413
00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:43.925
and brought it outta the house

414
00:21:43.925 --> 00:21:45.565
of Aine Daab, which was on the hill.

415
00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:50.445
And Za and Ohio, the sons of Abada were driving the new cart

416
00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:51.525
with the arc of God.

417
00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:54.285
And Ohio went before the arc.

418
00:21:56.075 --> 00:21:57.855
Now this is the same arc of God

419
00:21:57.855 --> 00:22:00.055
that we saw in one Samuel, right?

420
00:22:00.375 --> 00:22:02.055
Remember that it's the same arc that Harrison Ford was

421
00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:04.335
looking for, probably, I don't know, maybe not.

422
00:22:05.675 --> 00:22:08.935
But um, seriously though this, this was

423
00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:12.695
the symbol of God's presence with his people.

424
00:22:14.195 --> 00:22:16.855
It was where they would meet with God.

425
00:22:16.915 --> 00:22:19.135
The the high priest would go in to the holy

426
00:22:19.135 --> 00:22:23.415
of Holies once a year with the atonement, blood sprinkled

427
00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:27.375
sacrificial system to say, to forgive their sins.

428
00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:31.415
All of that, that was the presence of God was illustrated

429
00:22:31.795 --> 00:22:32.935
by this arc.

430
00:22:34.675 --> 00:22:36.815
Now as we see this process happen in chapter six,

431
00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:38.495
right away we see something that's off

432
00:22:41.175 --> 00:22:45.945
This cart was not the prescribed way God had for them

433
00:22:45.965 --> 00:22:47.745
to transport the ark when they needed to.

434
00:22:49.255 --> 00:22:53.265
Very clearly back in Exodus it was supposed to be Levites

435
00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:56.995
using specific poles through the rings on the Ark

436
00:22:56.995 --> 00:23:01.425
of the Covenant, the priests carrying it by hand.

437
00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:05.205
And so here's a difference right now.

438
00:23:05.205 --> 00:23:07.045
Now here David's heart was right.

439
00:23:07.865 --> 00:23:10.685
He wanted the presence of God with him in Jerusalem,

440
00:23:11.065 --> 00:23:12.805
but his method was wrong.

441
00:23:16.715 --> 00:23:18.485
Just as a side note, good intentions,

442
00:23:18.615 --> 00:23:21.805
never excuse disobedience to God's clear commands.

443
00:23:24.505 --> 00:23:26.365
But I wanted to do, I meant to no

444
00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:31.115
do it the way God says to do it

445
00:23:32.185 --> 00:23:34.155
because here's what happened next, watch this.

446
00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:36.035
It's pretty shocking. Verses five through seven

447
00:23:39.295 --> 00:23:41.555
and David and all the house of Israel were celebrating

448
00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:44.155
before the Lord with songs liars, harps, tambourines,

449
00:23:44.155 --> 00:23:45.155
castane, net symbols.

450
00:23:45.505 --> 00:23:47.525
And when they came to the threshing floor of naan,

451
00:23:48.145 --> 00:23:51.445
za put out his hand to the Ark of God, took hold of it

452
00:23:51.665 --> 00:23:52.845
for the oxen stumbled

453
00:23:54.585 --> 00:23:57.485
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Za.

454
00:23:57.485 --> 00:23:59.925
And God struck him down there because of his error.

455
00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:02.965
And he died there beside the Ark of God.

456
00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:07.825
It's pretty stunning, isn't it?

457
00:24:12.915 --> 00:24:17.765
God's direct command back in Exodus, nobody touched the box

458
00:24:19.595 --> 00:24:21.125
like that was abundantly clear.

459
00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:23.925
Nobody was to touch the Ark of the Covenant.

460
00:24:26.545 --> 00:24:28.525
But but you have to put yourself in this shoes, right?

461
00:24:28.525 --> 00:24:31.325
Like USA it seems noble,

462
00:24:33.025 --> 00:24:36.485
the oxen stumble the cart kind of hits a bump or something

463
00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:39.045
and it looks like the arc of the covenant is gonna fall off.

464
00:24:39.065 --> 00:24:41.285
And so he puts his hands up to stop it

465
00:24:42.235 --> 00:24:43.325
from falling on the ground

466
00:24:47.895 --> 00:24:49.555
and he ends up dying on the spot.

467
00:24:53.405 --> 00:24:55.415
Well, what he did wasn't noble,

468
00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:57.775
it was actually presumptuous.

469
00:24:59.635 --> 00:25:03.215
It was a lack of trust in God's sovereignty

470
00:25:03.215 --> 00:25:05.615
that God could handle the arc of God himself.

471
00:25:06.045 --> 00:25:08.375
He's in control of everything that was happening.

472
00:25:08.775 --> 00:25:10.775
Za says, no, no, I've got to take control here.

473
00:25:10.995 --> 00:25:12.455
It looks like it's about to go this way.

474
00:25:12.655 --> 00:25:14.335
I need to pull this back.

475
00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:20.465
And in this USA's death was a sign

476
00:25:21.295 --> 00:25:24.705
that God's holiness cannot be trifled with.

477
00:25:25.845 --> 00:25:29.505
It Must not be handled flippantly.

478
00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:33.815
Watch David's response in verse eight.

479
00:25:37.075 --> 00:25:38.295
And David was angry

480
00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:42.255
because the Lord had broken out against za.

481
00:25:42.255 --> 00:25:44.615
Now that's, that's a valid response, right?

482
00:25:44.615 --> 00:25:48.495
He's asking questions, God, what are you doing?

483
00:25:51.175 --> 00:25:53.515
He, he's questioning the whole thing here.

484
00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:55.755
And so he's angry

485
00:25:56.575 --> 00:25:59.195
and yet at the same time we see fear, we see

486
00:25:59.715 --> 00:26:00.875
reverence for God.

487
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:02.235
Look at verses nine through 11.

488
00:26:02.415 --> 00:26:04.875
And David was afraid of the Lord that day

489
00:26:05.215 --> 00:26:07.635
and he said, how can the ark of the Lord come to me?

490
00:26:08.175 --> 00:26:09.875
And so David was not willing to take the ark

491
00:26:09.875 --> 00:26:11.035
of the Lord into the city of David,

492
00:26:11.215 --> 00:26:14.195
but David took it aside to the house of Obed, Edam, the Tite

493
00:26:14.615 --> 00:26:16.555
and the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed,

494
00:26:16.795 --> 00:26:18.795
Edam the Tite for three months.

495
00:26:19.855 --> 00:26:21.555
And the Lord blessed Obed, Edam

496
00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:25.435
and all his household again, just the power of God

497
00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:29.075
by its very presence, brought blessing on that household.

498
00:26:29.535 --> 00:26:30.635
It shows something there.

499
00:26:30.635 --> 00:26:31.795
But, but I want you to think about

500
00:26:31.795 --> 00:26:33.955
what David would've been doing in those three months.

501
00:26:35.495 --> 00:26:37.475
The arc of God that he was intending to bring home

502
00:26:39.605 --> 00:26:41.145
now is sitting in somebody's barn.

503
00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:48.385
And what is David reflecting on? What just happened?

504
00:26:49.215 --> 00:26:52.745
He's for three months reflecting on the holiness of God

505
00:26:52.855 --> 00:26:57.695
that he saw one of his brothers right next

506
00:26:57.695 --> 00:27:00.575
to the Ark of God die because he touched it.

507
00:27:03.305 --> 00:27:05.525
He has to reflect. And what was God doing?

508
00:27:05.705 --> 00:27:10.605
God was drawing his heart towards deeper reverence

509
00:27:12.215 --> 00:27:14.385
that David would've grown in this awe

510
00:27:14.685 --> 00:27:18.345
and wonder, which is the the point here

511
00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:23.585
as you and I revere God, we grow in worship

512
00:27:26.285 --> 00:27:31.065
as we grow in this reverence, in this awe,

513
00:27:31.175 --> 00:27:32.785
this stunned reality

514
00:27:32.925 --> 00:27:37.425
before a holy God that will grow our worship.

515
00:27:41.305 --> 00:27:43.245
You saw that word afraid.

516
00:27:43.675 --> 00:27:47.565
Show up if you do a study through the Bible dozens

517
00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:51.365
of times this phrase fear of God or fear of the Lord.

518
00:27:51.675 --> 00:27:54.085
Some form of that show up in the Bible.

519
00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:58.005
Now today for us we tend to think of the word fear

520
00:27:58.005 --> 00:27:59.765
and we think of being afraid of something,

521
00:27:59.815 --> 00:28:01.965
being terrified of something.

522
00:28:02.185 --> 00:28:05.245
And there is an element of that in this, right?

523
00:28:07.595 --> 00:28:11.805
This guy was on the spot judged if,

524
00:28:11.805 --> 00:28:13.645
if God could take you out on the spot,

525
00:28:13.645 --> 00:28:15.045
there should be a bit of fear there.

526
00:28:16.415 --> 00:28:19.485
There should be a measure of healthy like I am not God.

527
00:28:19.485 --> 00:28:22.565
He is and I should be concerned in some way about that.

528
00:28:22.905 --> 00:28:25.965
But mainly that word fear in the Bible is used with a sense

529
00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:30.645
of respect and awe wonder at

530
00:28:30.665 --> 00:28:34.845
who God is at His power that you're just stunned by God.

531
00:28:37.535 --> 00:28:38.985
That word is reverence.

532
00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.225
That there's times where you would just go

533
00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:43.665
utterly silent before the Lord.

534
00:28:43.695 --> 00:28:47.065
It's like Isaiah six, he got a vision of God on his throne

535
00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:50.265
and his face went on the ground and he just said, woe is me.

536
00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:51.665
I'm a man of unclean lips.

537
00:28:51.725 --> 00:28:53.305
I'm among a people of unclean lips.

538
00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:54.785
I can't stand before God.

539
00:28:55.905 --> 00:28:57.885
That's what we're talking about, reverence.

540
00:29:01.385 --> 00:29:02.865
I was trying to think of a good way to illustrate this.

541
00:29:02.895 --> 00:29:04.545
It's, it's not a great illustration,

542
00:29:04.545 --> 00:29:06.385
but kids, you know what it feels like

543
00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.225
whenever a huge dog walks up

544
00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:12.025
to sniff you in the face, right?

545
00:29:12.025 --> 00:29:15.425
Like it's terrifying and cool at the same time.

546
00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:18.505
Like you, you want the dog to like you

547
00:29:18.605 --> 00:29:20.505
but you also don't want the dog to hurt you

548
00:29:21.085 --> 00:29:23.225
and you're kinda respecting it but you love it.

549
00:29:23.285 --> 00:29:26.985
And all this, it's like this weird dynamic of fear mixed

550
00:29:27.055 --> 00:29:29.225
with a a desire.

551
00:29:31.535 --> 00:29:33.425
It's kind of like the fear here.

552
00:29:33.485 --> 00:29:34.025
It is not a perfect

553
00:29:34.025 --> 00:29:35.505
illustration, but it's kind of like that.

554
00:29:37.445 --> 00:29:40.785
And so let's think about this from two Samuel six,

555
00:29:41.435 --> 00:29:45.525
what just happened here with USA and the cart and the arc?

556
00:29:45.525 --> 00:29:47.445
Like what just happened here? Let's think about this.

557
00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:50.365
If this is who God is,

558
00:29:54.145 --> 00:29:57.605
if this, if this is who God is, we are so casual

559
00:29:58.265 --> 00:30:03.245
in approaching his throne, right man,

560
00:30:03.265 --> 00:30:05.845
we just go with it like, like flippantly.

561
00:30:06.345 --> 00:30:08.445
Now we, I'm not saying we don't come boldly

562
00:30:08.445 --> 00:30:10.885
before the throne by the blood of Christ.

563
00:30:11.025 --> 00:30:14.565
Yes we can come boldly, but we should never come carelessly

564
00:30:18.535 --> 00:30:22.665
because the same God who welcomes us in His grace

565
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:26.945
is the same God whose holiness consumed usa.

566
00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:29.155
It's not different gods,

567
00:30:29.545 --> 00:30:31.355
it's not an Old Testament God, a New Testament God.

568
00:30:31.355 --> 00:30:35.475
This is the one true God all over it. That's the same God.

569
00:30:35.575 --> 00:30:38.275
We serve a God of both mercy and majesty.

570
00:30:45.615 --> 00:30:47.775
Remember that when you're sitting alone at your computer

571
00:30:48.045 --> 00:30:48.535
tonight,

572
00:30:53.725 --> 00:30:56.595
think about that when you're deciding whether to go

573
00:30:56.595 --> 00:30:57.715
to the bar Friday night or not,

574
00:31:02.605 --> 00:31:03.495
walk in this room

575
00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:09.625
With A renewed sense of expectation that you're meeting

576
00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:10.945
with the God of the universe.

577
00:31:13.025 --> 00:31:15.755
Like can you just imagine if Jesus was sitting right here,

578
00:31:16.095 --> 00:31:17.155
how this whole thing would

579
00:31:17.155 --> 00:31:21.005
change, how would we be different?

580
00:31:21.345 --> 00:31:23.525
How would it be different if Jesus is sitting next to you

581
00:31:23.585 --> 00:31:25.085
as you're on your computer tonight,

582
00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:26.885
how would it be different as you're walking

583
00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:29.845
through school the hallways and Jesus is walking with you?

584
00:31:29.985 --> 00:31:31.645
How would your words change your actions,

585
00:31:31.645 --> 00:31:32.925
change your thoughts, change.

586
00:31:33.305 --> 00:31:34.805
He is there with you.

587
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.485
He is here with us.

588
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.645
He is enthroned right now sitting right here

589
00:31:42.115 --> 00:31:43.165
receiving our worship.

590
00:31:43.545 --> 00:31:46.245
And so should that change anything about us?

591
00:31:49.945 --> 00:31:51.525
And here I'm not trying to scare you.

592
00:31:52.545 --> 00:31:54.485
We have to understand His holiness.

593
00:31:54.585 --> 00:31:56.845
If we're going to appreciate his grace,

594
00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:02.085
like to get this picture of him and his holiness

595
00:32:02.225 --> 00:32:05.325
and we are so far from that we are deserving of nothing

596
00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:06.765
but judgment like usa.

597
00:32:06.865 --> 00:32:08.125
We deserve that.

598
00:32:08.305 --> 00:32:11.205
And yet yet,

599
00:32:12.815 --> 00:32:14.075
he looked at us and said, no, no,

600
00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:16.035
I want you to be a part of my family.

601
00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:20.665
Pay for you with my son's life like that.

602
00:32:20.735 --> 00:32:22.705
That should spark something in us, right?

603
00:32:23.885 --> 00:32:26.825
And I want you to watch how David responded next.

604
00:32:27.325 --> 00:32:29.865
He, he processed the three months he thought through it,

605
00:32:29.955 --> 00:32:30.985
watch what he does next.

606
00:32:30.985 --> 00:32:35.955
Verse 12. And it was told King David,

607
00:32:35.955 --> 00:32:37.955
the Lord is blessed the household of obit edem

608
00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:40.100
and all that belongs to him because the ark of God is there.

609
00:32:40.225 --> 00:32:42.085
And so David went and brought up the Ark

610
00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:44.405
of God from the house of Obed Edem to the city of David

611
00:32:44.715 --> 00:32:46.045
with rejoicing.

612
00:32:46.865 --> 00:32:48.405
And when those who bore the ark

613
00:32:48.405 --> 00:32:51.845
of the Lord had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox

614
00:32:52.025 --> 00:32:53.045
and a fatten animal.

615
00:32:53.345 --> 00:32:55.325
And we assume every six steps that would've happened.

616
00:32:55.785 --> 00:32:58.165
And David danced before the Lord with all his might.

617
00:32:58.165 --> 00:32:59.805
And David was wearing a linen ephod.

618
00:32:59.905 --> 00:33:02.285
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark

619
00:33:02.285 --> 00:33:05.165
of the Lord was shouting and with the sound of the horn,

620
00:33:06.705 --> 00:33:08.085
see now they're doing it God's way.

621
00:33:09.155 --> 00:33:10.805
Like the priests we're carrying it.

622
00:33:10.825 --> 00:33:13.285
Now they're sacrificing in light of God's holiness.

623
00:33:13.285 --> 00:33:15.085
They understand it now. And so they're like, God,

624
00:33:15.085 --> 00:33:16.605
we don't wanna do anything wrong here.

625
00:33:16.605 --> 00:33:18.205
We're gonna sacrifice, we're gonna sacrifice,

626
00:33:18.205 --> 00:33:19.605
we're gonna carry it like you told us to.

627
00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:21.325
All of that is happening right here.

628
00:33:21.465 --> 00:33:22.845
And look what it unleashed.

629
00:33:22.945 --> 00:33:26.125
You see David dancing and people celebrating.

630
00:33:28.905 --> 00:33:29.845
Here's the problem though, not

631
00:33:29.845 --> 00:33:30.765
everybody was excited about this.

632
00:33:31.505 --> 00:33:33.205
It, It seems like it,

633
00:33:34.225 --> 00:33:38.405
but David's wife McCall, that was Saul's daughter.

634
00:33:38.805 --> 00:33:39.885
Remember they got married in one Samuel.

635
00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.765
She was offended at the way David

636
00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:46.325
responded to the Ark's return.

637
00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:50.805
In fact of verse 16 says, she despised him in her heart,

638
00:33:52.615 --> 00:33:55.095
Despised him for his response.

639
00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:58.295
'cause here's what she thought. She thought he went too far

640
00:33:59.565 --> 00:34:01.345
and he stripped down to his linen eod,

641
00:34:01.345 --> 00:34:03.545
which was basically the undershirt under their robes.

642
00:34:03.545 --> 00:34:05.065
That was essentially that.

643
00:34:05.165 --> 00:34:06.585
And and he, he did that

644
00:34:06.845 --> 00:34:08.665
and he would dance and all of these things.

645
00:34:08.685 --> 00:34:13.345
And so she thought Pridefully, she was focused on his image,

646
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.345
his role, his status

647
00:34:15.525 --> 00:34:18.465
before the people like David, you went too far, man,

648
00:34:18.645 --> 00:34:19.745
you should not have done that

649
00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:21.385
because they're not gonna respect you anymore.

650
00:34:21.415 --> 00:34:22.985
They're not gonna follow you anymore.

651
00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:25.985
This is going to hurt your influence.

652
00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:33.965
Here's how David responded. Look at verses 21 and 22.

653
00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.275
And David said to McCall, it was

654
00:34:39.335 --> 00:34:43.755
before the Lord who chose me

655
00:34:43.755 --> 00:34:45.995
above your father and above all his house, to appoint me

656
00:34:45.995 --> 00:34:48.795
as prince or leader over Israel, the people of the Lord.

657
00:34:49.095 --> 00:34:51.835
And I will celebrate before the Lord.

658
00:34:53.155 --> 00:34:55.155
I will make myself yet more contemptible.

659
00:34:55.155 --> 00:34:58.075
Some translations, I'll make myself undignified

660
00:34:59.705 --> 00:35:01.365
and I'll be a base in your eyes.

661
00:35:01.545 --> 00:35:04.245
But by the female servants of whom you have spoken by them,

662
00:35:04.405 --> 00:35:06.005
I shall be held in honor.

663
00:35:06.195 --> 00:35:08.725
He's saying I'm gonna be even more undignified.

664
00:35:08.945 --> 00:35:11.125
And I know you don't like it, but you know what?

665
00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:13.925
Those people will respect it because they understand grace.

666
00:35:16.265 --> 00:35:19.795
What you're seeing here is David's humility, right?

667
00:35:19.795 --> 00:35:24.035
He understood what grace of God he gave me

668
00:35:24.095 --> 00:35:25.515
to choose me to be the king.

669
00:35:25.615 --> 00:35:28.355
Really? How could I not celebrate?

670
00:35:29.095 --> 00:35:31.835
How could I not give praise to this one who chose me out

671
00:35:31.835 --> 00:35:35.555
of all of Israel, my little family, I was the weakest.

672
00:35:35.695 --> 00:35:39.405
He chose me. How could I not celebrate McCall?

673
00:35:39.565 --> 00:35:40.645
I don't care what you think.

674
00:35:44.335 --> 00:35:46.035
He wasn't worried about what McCall thought.

675
00:35:46.095 --> 00:35:48.435
He was more concerned about what God thought of him,

676
00:35:50.025 --> 00:35:51.835
even at the cost of his own reputation.

677
00:35:51.895 --> 00:35:54.515
He said, no, I'll be more undignified

678
00:35:54.515 --> 00:35:56.235
because he is worth it.

679
00:35:56.265 --> 00:35:59.195
Galatians one 10 says this, I am now.

680
00:35:59.535 --> 00:36:02.435
Am I now seeking the approval of man or of God?

681
00:36:03.775 --> 00:36:05.195
If I were still trying to please man,

682
00:36:05.275 --> 00:36:07.635
I would not be a servant of Christ.

683
00:36:07.795 --> 00:36:09.075
I think you see where this is going, right?

684
00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:13.515
We must worship as we rejoice

685
00:36:14.095 --> 00:36:16.235
in our God as well.

686
00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.415
He said he brought it back with rejoicing.

687
00:36:19.605 --> 00:36:21.015
He's showing rejoicing.

688
00:36:21.165 --> 00:36:23.735
He's dancing, he's celebrating their, their loud music.

689
00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.135
All of the things. There's celebration happening.

690
00:36:26.195 --> 00:36:29.215
We must worship as we rejoice as well.

691
00:36:29.415 --> 00:36:34.015
'cause we have so much that we can give praise to God for

692
00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:39.295
Is grace to us Joy-filled praise in response.

693
00:36:39.295 --> 00:36:41.055
And listen, I'm not saying life is not hard.

694
00:36:41.335 --> 00:36:44.175
I know life is difficult for you and and many in this room.

695
00:36:44.365 --> 00:36:46.895
This last week has been hard for many people.

696
00:36:46.985 --> 00:36:48.495
We'll talk a bit more about that later.

697
00:36:48.515 --> 00:36:52.255
But listen to Nehemiah eight 10, the joy

698
00:36:52.435 --> 00:36:54.135
of the Lord is my strength.

699
00:36:56.315 --> 00:37:00.455
And Nehemiah said that when Israel was a train wreck,

700
00:37:02.925 --> 00:37:04.015
they came back to the land.

701
00:37:04.015 --> 00:37:06.935
They have to rebuild the walls. It's in shambles.

702
00:37:08.475 --> 00:37:11.615
But they recognized God's grace in all of it,

703
00:37:12.595 --> 00:37:13.815
his goodness to them.

704
00:37:14.595 --> 00:37:18.415
And so he could say, the joy of the Lord is my strength.

705
00:37:20.185 --> 00:37:24.685
And they were able to have joy in the midst of hardship.

706
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:30.325
Is that the kind of worshiper that you are?

707
00:37:34.035 --> 00:37:37.535
Are you able to worship in the midst of hardship?

708
00:37:39.515 --> 00:37:42.335
Are you able to respond like David did?

709
00:37:43.335 --> 00:37:46.295
Undignified, willing to be that in response

710
00:37:46.295 --> 00:37:47.895
to God's glory and grace in your life?

711
00:37:48.075 --> 00:37:51.375
Are you ashamed like McCall Paul,

712
00:37:53.845 --> 00:37:55.455
worried about what other people think?

713
00:37:57.955 --> 00:37:59.335
Are you this kind of worshiper?

714
00:38:03.775 --> 00:38:05.835
Now here's, here's what I, I don't want you to hear.

715
00:38:07.415 --> 00:38:09.315
I'm not saying that in response to this.

716
00:38:10.015 --> 00:38:12.395
You all gotta roll around on the aisles and run laps

717
00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:14.595
and worship like that's not what I'm saying about this.

718
00:38:14.705 --> 00:38:14.995
Okay,

719
00:38:20.145 --> 00:38:20.845
But why?

720
00:38:21.155 --> 00:38:25.205
Just ask yourself, why am I ashamed

721
00:38:25.985 --> 00:38:28.445
to worship my savior king?

722
00:38:33.495 --> 00:38:37.605
Why am I ashamed to speak up

723
00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:39.005
and say I'm a Christian?

724
00:38:41.325 --> 00:38:42.385
Why am I scared of that?

725
00:38:46.415 --> 00:38:51.145
Like shouldn't it spark joy when we remember

726
00:38:51.145 --> 00:38:53.665
that the only reason that we who are unholy

727
00:38:54.885 --> 00:38:57.025
can rejoice in a holy God is

728
00:38:57.025 --> 00:38:59.345
because of all that Jesus has done for us?

729
00:39:00.335 --> 00:39:03.345
Like shouldn't that spark something in us that we see

730
00:39:03.365 --> 00:39:04.905
how far from him we actually are.

731
00:39:05.085 --> 00:39:07.425
And then he looked at us, his enemies

732
00:39:07.485 --> 00:39:08.625
and said, I'm gonna pay for you

733
00:39:08.625 --> 00:39:10.065
to be in my family with my son's life.

734
00:39:10.215 --> 00:39:13.305
Come on, be with me for you don't deserve it.

735
00:39:13.465 --> 00:39:16.585
You deserve judgment. I'm bringing you into my family and

736
00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:19.385
and we see how stunned we should be by that.

737
00:39:19.565 --> 00:39:23.505
Should that not spark joy, the praise of God,

738
00:39:23.845 --> 00:39:26.665
the joy filled explosion of just wonder

739
00:39:30.365 --> 00:39:33.465
he took the judgment we deserve so

740
00:39:33.465 --> 00:39:36.865
that we could come boldly to his throne of grace,

741
00:39:37.485 --> 00:39:40.665
not carelessly, but boldly to his throne.

742
00:39:40.965 --> 00:39:44.545
How much more should we worship because of that truth?

743
00:39:47.325 --> 00:39:50.625
And listen sometimes. Sometimes that's gonna have to happen

744
00:39:50.765 --> 00:39:53.185
as you wait through the 20 years of the wilderness.

745
00:39:55.775 --> 00:39:56.995
And you're gonna have to look at him

746
00:39:57.015 --> 00:39:58.875
and say, okay, Jesus, you're worth it.

747
00:40:01.115 --> 00:40:05.675
I don't know if or when you will, but you're worth it.

748
00:40:05.675 --> 00:40:08.555
I'm gonna worship as I wait. What a testimony that is.

749
00:40:11.965 --> 00:40:16.455
And sometimes that worship is not gonna be loud, explosive.

750
00:40:16.885 --> 00:40:20.655
It's gonna be you deeply impacted by the

751
00:40:22.455 --> 00:40:25.415
holiness of God to where you're on your face before him

752
00:40:27.075 --> 00:40:28.415
and you can't even lift your eyes

753
00:40:28.415 --> 00:40:30.335
because you're so overwhelmed by the glory

754
00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:33.415
of God reminding you of your depravity

755
00:40:33.955 --> 00:40:35.295
and how far you are from him.

756
00:40:35.515 --> 00:40:38.295
That's then a response of worship to say, God,

757
00:40:38.315 --> 00:40:39.535
you are who you say you are.

758
00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:44.015
But all of that should lead us to more joy

759
00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:46.575
and more exuberant praise

760
00:40:46.795 --> 00:40:49.695
for the God who's done everything necessary for us

761
00:40:49.715 --> 00:40:51.815
to be in relationship with him forever.

762
00:40:58.575 --> 00:41:03.155
We are more than willing to raise our hands and sing loud

763
00:41:03.155 --> 00:41:05.955
and shout loudly when our football team wins.

764
00:41:09.415 --> 00:41:10.515
And yet we look bored

765
00:41:12.215 --> 00:41:14.195
and we're scared of what people think about us

766
00:41:15.985 --> 00:41:20.635
when we're saying to Jesus, you are God, you are my savior.

767
00:41:21.235 --> 00:41:23.995
I don't deserve it. Praise you forever.

768
00:41:29.435 --> 00:41:30.795
I just wanna invite our worship team out

769
00:41:32.015 --> 00:41:33.325
and I want us to go ahead and begin

770
00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:34.605
to stand up if you're able,

771
00:41:35.275 --> 00:41:37.605
because what we need to do is respond.

772
00:41:42.465 --> 00:41:44.085
And here's what that means today.

773
00:41:45.745 --> 00:41:47.405
It might mean that you don't stand up

774
00:41:48.825 --> 00:41:50.925
and your response is just to get on your face

775
00:41:51.005 --> 00:41:55.965
before God Because you're in

776
00:41:55.965 --> 00:41:57.645
a season of waiting or,

777
00:41:57.785 --> 00:42:01.645
or you're in a season of like, I,

778
00:42:03.675 --> 00:42:06.565
I've flippantly handled this thing with God

779
00:42:06.565 --> 00:42:09.125
and I don't see him as who he is.

780
00:42:10.505 --> 00:42:12.565
And maybe that means on your face, maybe that means

781
00:42:13.025 --> 00:42:15.965
for the first time you kind of tune out,

782
00:42:17.515 --> 00:42:19.085
there's a, there's a corporate side of worship

783
00:42:19.115 --> 00:42:20.525
that we are encouraging each other, but,

784
00:42:20.585 --> 00:42:22.045
but for the first time, you're not thinking about

785
00:42:22.045 --> 00:42:23.485
what everybody, everybody else is thinking about you.

786
00:42:23.485 --> 00:42:25.325
You're thinking about what God thinks

787
00:42:26.505 --> 00:42:30.365
and responding to him in worship to

788
00:42:30.365 --> 00:42:32.725
where you sing hallelujah, which simply means,

789
00:42:32.785 --> 00:42:34.165
praise our God.

790
00:42:35.265 --> 00:42:39.165
And you sing that boldly, loudly for the first time.

791
00:42:42.105 --> 00:42:43.725
Or maybe you're just like, I don't know anything about this.

792
00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:45.645
I'm struggling with this whole thing about who God is.

793
00:42:45.915 --> 00:42:48.085
There's men and women along the sides of this room

794
00:42:48.955 --> 00:42:51.325
that just right now you, you step outta your seat

795
00:42:51.325 --> 00:42:53.445
and you go talk to them and say, Hey, I don't know

796
00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:55.885
that God been in church my whole life.

797
00:42:55.925 --> 00:42:57.365
I don't know what he's talking about. Can you help me?

798
00:42:57.625 --> 00:42:59.805
Or I pray for this and we'd love to pray for you for that.

799
00:43:00.555 --> 00:43:03.885
There's no shame in walking towards those people

800
00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:05.365
and saying, Hey, I need some help.

801
00:43:07.705 --> 00:43:10.125
Why would we be ashamed? This is what we do here.

802
00:43:11.665 --> 00:43:15.605
And worship is what we do. Worship out there is what we do.

803
00:43:15.745 --> 00:43:18.005
That's life. And so let's respond to him

804
00:43:18.385 --> 00:43:21.885
as we wait hard season of life.

805
00:43:21.885 --> 00:43:24.245
Let's wait and worship in response.
