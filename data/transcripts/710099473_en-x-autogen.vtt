1
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.900
if you

2
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.300
Jesus is Holy and he alone is worthy

3
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.000
of our praise.

4
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.200
It's a beautiful morning, it's so good to be

5
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800
gathered together with the body of Christ. Amen.

6
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.500
Well today the message I have for us.

7
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.500
Is a timely message.

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.200
For you for me for us as

9
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.800
a church.

10
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.600
Because some of you walked in here this morning.

11
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.400
feeling low

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.800
and isolated

13
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.500
and wondering if you matter at

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.700
all.

15
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.100
Hang with me because God's word will encourage

16
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.900
you today.

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.000
And some of you let's be honest some of you galloped in

18
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200
here on your high horse.

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.300
Hang with me because God's word will humble you

20
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.100
today?

21
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.900
Again, good morning. My name is Ryan Whittaker and

22
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.600
it is a joy to serve as one of your elders here.

23
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.300
I consider being able to share God's word

24
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.900
with you this morning such an incredible honor. So thank

25
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.600
you for this opportunity.

26
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.500
John is away this morning. He is

27
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.700
honoring his former congregation there in

28
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.900
Fort Worth.

29
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.400
For their 75th Anniversary, so pray for John pray

30
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.600
for Normandale Baptist.

31
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.400
And also Brett this morning is preaching at

32
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.100
all of it Baptist and view of his call which we talked about

33
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.600
last week. So pray for them both.

34
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
now if you will turn in your Bibles with me to First

35
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.100
Corinthians chapter 12

36
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.600
First Corinthians is in the middle of your new testament. It's

37
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.000
right after acts in Romans.

38
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.600
And while you're turning there, John has been walking us

39
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.900
through a series called Jesus.

40
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.800
to love him is to dot dot dot

41
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.100
And so far we've we've learned how the study

42
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.300
of God's word is the most transformative discipline

43
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.700
we can do.

44
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.900
We learned about prayer and how that deepens our relationship

45
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.500
with Jesus.

46
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900
And last week we learned about fasting which which

47
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.500
grows us into humility and

48
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.900
dependence and focus on him.

49
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200
This morning we're looking at serving.

50
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.000
Which that's our main point today, Jesus to love

51
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.500
him is to serve.

52
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.800
in unity drives why we serve

53
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.100
Unity drives why we serve

54
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200
So, where do we see that?

55
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.600
In the Bible that Unity drives where we why

56
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.300
we serve well, we'll see it like a banner being

57
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.900
unfurled before us as we read First Corinthians now

58
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.200
in this letter Paul is writing to believers.

59
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.300
And Paul is writing into and speaking into

60
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300
a specific situation.

61
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.600
What is this? What is the situation he's speaking about?

62
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.200
Well, imagine that we're in a plane.

63
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.400
And we're flying over the city

64
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.300
of Corinth.

65
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
And it's night time.

66
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.300
And you look out the small circle window down

67
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.600
below.

68
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.600
and you see and you hear

69
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.600
boom

70
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.600
boom

71
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.900
boom boom

72
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.500
explosions

73
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.100
all over the ground below lighting up

74
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.800
the night sky

75
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.000
and that is a good picture of the Corinthian Church.

76
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.000
It's exploding from

77
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.500
but it's not from from bombs or grenades or

78
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.100
gunfire.

79
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.600
But rather from mortar shelves of

80
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.500
division and fighting and

81
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.600
critical spirits.

82
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.600
In the church is being torn apart.

83
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.200
by the shrapnel of snobbery

84
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.300
and one upmanship and in jealousy

85
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.400
in the place is spiritually war-torn and it

86
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.800
is messy.

87
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.600
This is starting to feel real.

88
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.400
This division is the main reason that Paul is

89
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.700
writing First Corinthians.

90
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.900
And we see this in First Corinthians 1:10, very

91
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.300
clearly.

92
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.300
I appeal to you Brothers by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ

93
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.200
that all of you agree.

94
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.800
And that there be no divisions among you but that you be United in

95
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.000
the same mind and the same judgment.

96
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.300
For it's been reported to me by Chloe's people that there

97
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.700
is quarreling among you my brothers.

98
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.800
So Paul saying I appeal to you that that you

99
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.300
agree that there be no divisions among you no

100
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.700
quarreling that you be United.

101
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.500
Paul is saying to the Corinthians into all churches across the

102
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.500
ages. Your church is a mess of

103
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.200
division.

104
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.000
Let's clean this place up.

105
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.100
It's kind of like your mom who says I am going to sit here

106
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.400
and I'm gonna watch you until you do it.

107
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.400
So now let's land the plane in chapter 12

108
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.500
where we find ourselves today.

109
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.600
Let's dig into God's word together our authority over

110
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.200
anything that might come out of my mouth today. This

111
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.400
is our anchoring truth. We say around here.

112
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.900
Now this isn't normal practice for us.

113
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.900
But as one body.

114
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.300
Let's all stand together if you're able for

115
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.400
the reading of God's word.

116
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.600
As I read First Corinthians 12 verse 12 through

117
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.100
27.

118
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.900
For just as the body is one and has many members and all

119
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.400
the members of the body though many are one

120
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800
body. So it is with Christ.

121
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.200
For in one Spirit. We were all baptized into

122
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.400
the body Jews or Greek slaves are free

123
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.100
and all were made to drink of one spirit.

124
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.700
For the body does not consist of one member but of many.

125
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.300
If the foot should say because I'm not a hand. I do not belong to

126
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.100
the body. That would not make it any less a part of the body.

127
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.800
And if the ear should say because I am not an eye.

128
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.500
I do not belong to the body. That would not make it any less a

129
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.800
part of the body.

130
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.200
If the whole body were an eye where would be the

131
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.700
sense of hearing if the whole body were an ear where would

132
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.500
be the sense of smell?

133
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.400
But as it is God arranged the members in

134
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.500
the body each one of them as he chose

135
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.800
if all were a single member, where would

136
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.100
the body be?

137
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.000
As it is there are many parts. You have one body.

138
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.600
The eye cannot say to the hand. I have no need of you nor

139
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.500
again the head to the feet. I have no need of you.

140
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.100
On the contrary the parts of the body that seem to be weaker or

141
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.200
indispensable and on

142
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.500
the parts of the body that we think less honorable. We bestow the

143
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.400
greater honor.

144
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.200
And our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,

145
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.400
which are more presentable parts. Do not

146
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.800
require.

147
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.000
But God has so composed the body giving greater

148
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.600
honor to the part that lacked it that there

149
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.200
may be no division in their body that the members

150
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.300
may have the same care for one another.

151
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.500
If one member suffers all suffer together, if one

152
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.000
member is honored all Rejoice together. Now, you

153
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.300
are the body of Christ and individually

154
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.100
members of it.

155
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.300
This is the word of the Lord.

156
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.500
You can be seated.

157
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.200
Let's dive in the first point that scripture shows us

158
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.800
is that we serve because we're United We Serve

159
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.900
because we're United.

160
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.700
Remember the context of First Corinthians rampant explosive

161
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.300
division the opposite

162
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.000
of unity.

163
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.800
And in light of this disunity Paul is

164
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.600
trying to show us here in verse 12.

165
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.100
of this truth

166
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.400
for just as one just as the body is one and

167
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.800
has many members and all the members of the body though

168
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.500
many are one body. So it is with Christ.

169
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.200
The truth Paul reminds the Church of is that we

170
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.300
are united as one body.

171
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.400
And he compares the church as a body or to a

172
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.000
body. He's primarily talking about the local church here.

173
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.100
And just like the body is one that has many

174
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.300
members. So the church is one with many

175
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:10.700
members.

176
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.600
Now when Paul talks of the church as a

177
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.600
body, it's just a metaphor.

178
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.600
It's not some metaphysical claim that the church is literally

179
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.200
Christ's body.

180
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.200
We see throughout scripture that the church is

181
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.300
referred to by many metaphors. We've seen Vine flock.

182
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.700
a building a field

183
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.300
And each metaphor carries with it uniquely beautiful

184
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.100
Church truths about the church.

185
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.300
Now you may ask who belongs to the body of Christ?

186
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.800
Well Paul is excited to tell you.

187
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.900
It's all of us.

188
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.500
It's all of us.

189
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.500
every single one of us

190
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:58.800
if

191
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200
we are a believer.

192
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.400
that

193
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.200
that condition is implicit and it is

194
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.200
important remember again that Paul is

195
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.600
writing this letter to the Corinthian Church to

196
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.200
believers.

197
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.700
three times Paul tells us this in verse 13

198
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.600
for in one Spirit. We are all that's number

199
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.800
one all baptized into one body Jews or

200
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.300
Greeks slaves or free now this

201
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.900
Limitless diversity means all that's

202
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.400
number two.

203
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.300
In all number three, we're made to

204
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.700
drink of one spirit.

205
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.700
Now this kind of baptism and spirit language maybe

206
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.200
unfamiliar to you. So what does it

207
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.000
mean to be baptized in the spirit into the body into drink

208
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.000
of one spirit?

209
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.200
Well, it's important to understand that Paul's not writing of

210
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.500
the physical act of baptism that we see here on

211
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.200
Sundays.

212
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.100
No water baptism is a symbolic worshipful

213
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.400
profession of your faith in Jesus in obedience

214
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.300
to Jesus command.

215
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.000
The water baptism doesn't save us.

216
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.200
No.

217
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.900
Paul in verse 13 isn't talking about what we do in the baptistry.

218
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.400
But is instead talking about Spirit baptism, which

219
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.500
is part of our salvation.

220
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.400
We see in scripture how the Holy Spirit comes to dwell in

221
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.200
you to take up permanent residence in you.

222
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.400
When you understand yourself as a

223
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.100
sinner you turn away from your sins and you confess Jesus as

224
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.500
Lord.

225
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.400
To make this clear if you are a Believer, then

226
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.200
you are in the body of Christ.

227
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.400
And if you are a Believer you have drunk of the

228
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.000
Holy Spirit.

229
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.200
Conversely if you are not a Believer, then you are

230
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.300
not in the body of Christ.

231
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.100
Romans 8:9 says anyone who does not have the spirit of

232
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.800
Christ does not belong to him.

233
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.400
So let's go back to the text these two verses verses 12 to

234
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.700
13. Paul uses the word one.

235
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.500
five times

236
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.300
so in the face of explosions of division in the church

237
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.500
Paul is saying we are united to the

238
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.200
body of Christ.

239
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.600
So and also that we are to be

240
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.000
United in the body of Christ.

241
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.800
So we should act like it.

242
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.100
Take a moment now and look around this room.

243
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.100
No one in here is your enemy.

244
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.600
If we are one body in

245
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:50.800
Christ.

246
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.900
picking back up in verse 14

247
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.900
For the body does not consist of one member but of many.

248
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.600
The implication here is that there

249
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.100
are many parts.

250
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.700
Not many I not many identical parts to

251
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.400
be clear. That'd be terrifying. Imagine

252
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.900
a body full of noses.

253
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.800
But that we have many different parts and each part

254
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.700
serves a different purpose in the body.

255
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.300
That's our second point we serve because we are

256
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.100
different.

257
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.700
We serve because we're different.

258
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.200
As it goes we know that the body works best when all the

259
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.000
different parts are are healthy and are working together.

260
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.300
But then what what diseases creep in

261
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.200
to make the body unhealthy?

262
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.300
Well, we see two here.

263
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.900
Let's read about the first starting in verse 15.

264
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.100
If the foot should say because I'm not a hand. I do not belong to the

265
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.300
body. That would not make it any less a part of the body

266
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.700
and if the ear should say because I'm not an eye.

267
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.200
I do not belong to the body. That would not make

268
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.900
it any less a part of the body.

269
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.600
First what's going on here with the foot?

270
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.100
The foot sees the hand is more important.

271
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.600
So it might say something like oh hand lettering

272
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600
is so beautiful.

273
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.300
Why isn't there such a thing as foot lettering?

274
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.400
Right or the hand looks like it's having so much fun hint a

275
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.100
thumb wrestling, right?

276
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.000
or

277
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.300
the hand is really slapping the base.

278
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.100
He's jamming with his band that looks like

279
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.400
a lot of fun right or the ears struggling to

280
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.300
you and he's comparing itself to the eye. Oh the eye is so

281
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.800
beautiful.

282
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.600
Or the I can control how much light

283
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.400
it lets in.

284
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.800
Why can't I control how loud Things Are?

285
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.400
Or why does the driver's license have eye color,

286
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.000
but not your size.

287
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.800
blue xl

288
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.600
and so therefore the foot and the ear are both feeling low.

289
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.400
Wondering if they really matter at all.

290
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.100
Each or defeat it and they declare I'm not a

291
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.200
part of the body then.

292
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.200
What are the foot in the ear feeling here uselessness Envy

293
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.900
hatred even? Yes, I

294
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.400
think what we see here is what we would

295
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.400
call the infection of inadequacy the infection

296
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400
of inadequacy.

297
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.200
What do I mean by inadequacy? I think it's something that we've all felt

298
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.900
at some point in our life.

299
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.900
I know I have.

300
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.400
It's in many of you are feeling it today. You're feeling low.

301
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.500
You're wondering if you really matter if you're able to serve the

302
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.300
body at all.

303
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.600
After all, they know the Bible better than I do or their

304
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.600
prayers are so full of beautiful scripture.

305
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.700
Where I can't sing like her.

306
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.300
And therefore you self declare that you

307
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.100
have nothing to give to the church.

308
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.200
But Paul appeals to the body metaphor here no matter

309
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.200
what the foot or the ear says. They're

310
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.300
inextricably part of

311
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:25.900
the body.

312
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.100
They cannot be separated from it.

313
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.700
to any believers here today who feel inadequate

314
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.900
understand this no matter what the adversary the

315
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.500
devil is telling you.

316
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.700
You are a part of the body.

317
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.900
and you matter

318
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.300
you matter

319
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.400
let's continue Paul carries out more Body Logic starting

320
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.100
in verse 17.

321
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.100
If the whole body were an eye where would be the sense of

322
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.400
hearing?

323
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.900
If the whole body were in ear where would be the sense of smell but

324
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.500
as it is God arranged the members

325
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.700
in the body each one of them as he chose.

326
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.300
If all were a single member where would the

327
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:15.600
body be?

328
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.800
As it is there are many parts yet one body.

329
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.600
I'm gonna be try. I'm going to try and be careful with this story.

330
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.800
Not really sure if there's any way around it though. So let's

331
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.200
do this.

332
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.100
My dad was an eye surgeon until a few years ago and offhomologist.

333
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.100
When he and my mom were in San Antonio for his residency.

334
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.000
He would often be called on during the middle

335
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.800
of the night to have to go and collect.

336
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.100
one or both eyes

337
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.600
from the scene of something if you're

338
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:49.800
following me.

339
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.300
Now this would be from somebody who had who

340
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.900
is kind enough to have had the forethought to be a donor.

341
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.800
And these would later be used for corneal transplants.

342
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.000
One night. This is the first time that my dad

343
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.300
was ever called out for such a run he goes and he

344
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.500
he collects the eyes.

345
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.500
in two little glass sterile jars

346
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.000
The office however, it was closed.

347
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.000
And so he couldn't stop by the office on the way home to drop

348
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.500
them off in Cold Storage.

349
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.800
the next morning

350
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.700
My mom wakes up.

351
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.400
And she's bleary-eyed and she stumbles

352
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.600
into the kitchen.

353
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.900
And she opens the door.

354
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.700
whoa

355
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.700
in the refrigerator two eyes looking straight back

356
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.400
at her.

357
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.700
wide-eyed and bushy-tailed

358
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.900
I'm sorry, not bushy tail just wide-eyed.

359
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.400
Now my question to Dad. Is this Dad. Could

360
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.500
you not have at least slid the eyes behind

361
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.100
the butter?

362
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:09.600
You know.

363
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.800
Now were those eyes actually looking back at

364
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.300
my mom?

365
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.300
No, because they weren't connected to the body.

366
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.400
And that's the point Paul is trying to make here ice can't

367
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.000
do anything apart from the body.

368
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.800
Nor can eyes be the body that would

369
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.400
be terrifying.

370
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.900
The point is this we cannot survive in isolation.

371
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.400
Believer you are a part of the body.

372
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.000
Clear up the infection of inadequacy by

373
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.900
understanding what God's word says about

374
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.200
you.

375
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.700
Now what is the second disease that reeks havoc on the body?

376
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.500
Let's pick back up in verse 21.

377
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.200
The eye cannot say to the hand. I have no need of

378
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.400
you.

379
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.600
Or again the head to the feet. I have no need of you on the

380
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.700
contrary the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are

381
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.000
indispensable.

382
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.600
And on those parts of the body that we think less honorable. We

383
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.800
bestow the greater honor.

384
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.300
And our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty.

385
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.200
Which are more presentable parts do not require.

386
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.800
But God has so composed the body giving greater

387
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.900
honor to the part that lacked it.

388
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.400
What does Paul saying here?

389
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.400
The eye that some people might see is the Superior

390
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.300
part is thinking less of the hand.

391
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.300
And the head is thinking less of the feet and they

392
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.000
both are in conceit in arrogance in

393
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.300
oozing Pride.

394
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.200
Saying oh you aren't important.

395
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.900
I don't need you.

396
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.600
What we see here is the contagion of conceit.

397
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.800
the contagion of conceit

398
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.100
and in face of this conceit Paul says

399
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.700
that those weaker parts are actually

400
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.600
indispensable meaning 100% absolutely

401
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.600
necessary

402
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.000
in those parts considered less honorable or actually

403
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.000
more honorable.

404
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.900
They're given greater honor and those parts considered unpresentable

405
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.100
those body parts that we would

406
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.300
consider private.

407
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.400
Are actually given higher care.

408
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.400
These are the most necessary body parts and they are given

409
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.500
highest status.

410
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.100
This is the Divine reversal.

411
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.700
Understand this those of you here who are

412
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.000
conceited believers.

413
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.000
Those of you who galloped in here this morning on your

414
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:50.800
high horse.

415
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.700
The gospel economy doesn't work like the world's economy.

416
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.100
What Paul is saying here is that you might think that you

417
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.200
are the engine, but you are at best to paint.

418
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.500
Which also is necessary?

419
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.500
Listen anytime we compare ourselves with

420
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.300
someone else. We're comparing with the wrong standard.

421
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.200
Compare yourself to Christ and you will be rightly humbled.

422
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.300
Understand also that your faith has come to

423
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.300
you on the backs of thousands of people most of whom

424
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.900
you'll never know who they were.

425
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.400
And ultimately your faith is owing to nothing that

426
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:32.900
you've done.

427
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.100
Nothing, it's Grace.

428
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.100
therefore kill the contagion of

429
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.100
conceit kill it

430
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.300
by understanding what God's word says about

431
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:46.500
you.

432
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.000
With all this versus 15 to 20 Paul intentionally

433
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.400
draws and absurd picture of the

434
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:54.700
body.

435
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.500
The foot and the ear feel inadequate and the

436
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.600
eye in the head are conceded. It's absurd to

437
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.500
imagine the body working that way, isn't it?

438
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.200
So should it be absurd for Christ's bloodbought Church

439
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.800
to be destroyed by the divisive

440
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.300
diseases of conceit and inadequacy. It's

441
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.000
absurd.

442
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.400
As we've been reading you may have noticed that I've skated quickly

443
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.600
over a couple verses and it's these verses that

444
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.800
form the most potent cure.

445
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.100
To our divisive diseases here.

446
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.900
So this is our third point we serve because we're

447
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.300
designed we serve because

448
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.800
we're designed praise God.

449
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.500
Let's read Verse 18 Again. The context here

450
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.300
is the is the body part that feels inadequate.

451
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.000
But as it is God arranged.

452
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.400
or put in place or laid

453
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.600
each of the body parts every one of them as he chose.

454
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.300
And then now in verse 24 where the context

455
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.000
is the body part that is conceded.

456
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.600
It says this but God has so composed

457
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.300
the body giving greater honor to the part that lacked it.

458
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.000
Do you see the Common Thread here Church?

459
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.700
In verse 18 to the believer who feels inadequate he's saying understand that

460
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.900
God has arranged you.

461
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.300
in the body

462
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.300
and arrange really is too weak a translation of

463
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.200
the Greek here, but understand this he has

464
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.800
knitted you together.

465
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.500
Psalm 139 he has given

466
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.700
you gifts First Corinthians 12 verse 11,

467
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.100
and he is specifically and meticulously

468
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.500
arranged You Verse 18

469
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.400
in the body to play a needed role.

470
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.100
What's more Paul not once not twice,

471
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.000
but three times emphasizes

472
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.800
God's hand in you and

473
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.300
in the church.

474
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.000
See the emphasis here. God arranged the

475
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.300
body parts every single one

476
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.400
of them including you.

477
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.500
as he chose

478
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.700
and in verse 24, this is beautiful. It speaks to me says God has

479
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.200
so composed the body composed.

480
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.800
This shows God to be the master composer a million

481
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.200
times greater than Beethoven and he

482
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.200
is mixing and blending just so to create

483
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.400
his Masterpiece Symphony the

484
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.800
church.

485
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.300
God is Sovereign and he is good.

486
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.500
God is Sovereign and he is good and view of

487
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.100
God's Sovereign goodness then.

488
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.400
Be content.

489
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.600
And trust the Lord and how he's gifted you.

490
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.300
Be content and trust the Lord how he

491
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.200
is gifted you.

492
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.200
to be anything else

493
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.500
is to be discontent and to

494
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.200
distrust the creator of the universe.

495
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.200
It's not a place you want to be.

496
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200
We serve him because we are designed.

497
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.600
So far we've seen how we serve because

498
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.300
we're United.

499
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.000
Because we're different.

500
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.400
And because we are designed and this is a good place for us to push pause

501
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.500
for second here.

502
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.600
And to look at what does it look like to serve practically one

503
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.200
of our values is this idea of reimagine generosity

504
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.200
reimagine generosity?

505
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.500
Now when we think of generosity we tend to think about money.

506
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.800
But that's not all it is.

507
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.800
Instead we respond in faith by investing

508
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.300
not just our

509
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:04.700
money.

510
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.900
But our time skill effort and resources

511
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.600
to accomplish God's purposes.

512
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.300
So you might be thinking.

513
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.300
Then I want to serve generously how and where can

514
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:20.600
I serve?

515
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.400
Well, I'm glad you asked because hopefully you picked up

516
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.200
as he came in here this morning. We have this handy flyer. And here's

517
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.000
how you can serve with your body. That's the

518
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.500
next Point serve with your body.

519
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.000
one of the biggest misconceptions of a larger Church

520
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.700
Is that it doesn't need anything that the

521
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.700
opposite is true. And this list is just really

522
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.200
a fraction of the serving opportunities that

523
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.000
we have here at Henderson Hills.

524
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.900
Can you greet people? Well, we have we need eight greeters. For

525
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.100
instance. Can you drive we can

526
00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.500
we need drivers for our Afghan Ministry?

527
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.500
Be a buddy in our special needs Ministry on

528
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.000
Sundays and Wednesdays VBS.

529
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.300
And one of my one of my favorites here is can you

530
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.100
can you slap the bass?

531
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.200
Then Sling It slinging a bass guitar around your neck and slap the

532
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.500
base.

533
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:20.600
Okay.

534
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.600
Or can you disciple Jesus commands

535
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.600
it so if you're a Believer your answer should be yes.

536
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.400
We have more people needing discipling then

537
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.200
are doing it.

538
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.000
Especially men and women disciplining our students.

539
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.900
Pour into our students we would love that.

540
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.400
The list is long. So just circle what

541
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.500
you feel led toward or what interests you and then

542
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.700
drop it off at the information kiosk and

543
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.800
somebody will reach out to you. It's easy. It's easy.

544
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.300
Serve with your body.

545
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.300
Now anytime that you want to serve I get it sometime there are

546
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.000
mental hurdles to get over.

547
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.500
But don't overthink it.

548
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.500
My boys have taken up tennis. And so therefore

549
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.000
I have

550
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.200
tennis is a lot like other sports in the sense of just has

551
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.400
to go.

552
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.600
Just right for that little tennis ball to go just where

553
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.400
you want it to go.

554
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.400
There are a thousand body positions and

555
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.600
muscular responses in tennis to keep

556
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.500
track of in the second that you start to analyze just

557
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.000
one of them can really mess with your mind.

558
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.800
You get nervous and you can't focus and sometimes

559
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.700
in sports. This mental paralysis is

560
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.300
called The Yips.

561
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.800
The Yips

562
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.000
now I want to be sensitive here.

563
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.300
that's often wrapped up in things that

564
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:51.400
are

565
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.400
larger issues that need to be cared for

566
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.400
But in tennis when The Yips come on you try to

567
00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.900
serve but you can't.

568
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.500
double fault double fault double

569
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.000
fault

570
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.400
A double fault is where you make a mistake on both serves and

571
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.600
you you miss the point.

572
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.900
So what's the answer don't overthink your serve don't

573
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.000
overthink your serve.

574
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.700
Some of us in the church have serving yips.

575
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.500
Because it's easy to overthink it. Oh and am I

576
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.600
called to this is something that I can maintain for

577
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.000
years.

578
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.300
I kind of like this do I love this?

579
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.700
And then we get so paralyzed. We can't even take a swing.

580
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.400
Or we do take a swing and we we swing and miss

581
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.200
and it's it's a big swing and Miss but but understand

582
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.700
this.

583
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.500
That you that you tried shows

584
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.400
that you are engaged.

585
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.400
praise God for the misses

586
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.900
anyone here who has found their serve is standing on

587
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.100
a mountain of Mrs.

588
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.000
Practically just try one of these for two weeks see if

589
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.200
it fits.

590
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.000
If it doesn't try something else, right?

591
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.100
or

592
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.000
serve together as a CG.

593
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.300
Or recruit just one other person to serve

594
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.100
alongside you.

595
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.300
It's so much easier to go into something when you have somebody to be there with

596
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.300
you. It's a lot of fun.

597
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.800
So we want to encourage you here don't overthink your

598
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.200
serve.

599
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.300
You'll do great. You'll do great. I know

600
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:34.500
it.

601
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.100
Okay.

602
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.000
We would love your help.

603
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.100
And we'd much rather say whoa than giddy up.

604
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.200
Let's jump back into the text for our final truth 0.4 we

605
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.600
serve because we're harmonic we

606
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.000
serve because we're harmonic.

607
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.400
Now let's read that in the text starting again in verse 24

608
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:55.900
B.

609
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.400
But God is so composed the body giving greater honor

610
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.300
to the part that lacked it that there may be no division

611
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.300
in the body, but that the members may have the same care for

612
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:08.800
one another.

613
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.200
If one member suffers all suffer together if

614
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.500
one member is honored all Rejoice together.

615
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.500
Now you are the body of Christ and individually members

616
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.300
of it. Paul here is

617
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.600
painting a beautifully Rich picture of the church operating in

618
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.500
unity in diversity and now Harmony

619
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.000
in harmony because we are in sync. We're in

620
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.500
this together.

621
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.200
We suffer together. We Rejoice together co-suffering co-rejoicing.

622
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.300
Romans, 12:15 says something similar Rejoice with those

623
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.500
who rejoice and weep with those who weep.

624
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.800
Let that be a warning light indicator to

625
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.300
you when you have veered off into the

626
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.100
ditch of disharmony.

627
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.000
Be honest with yourself. Are you able to Rejoice whenever

628
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.900
they make the team?

629
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.500
Whenever they get the promotion whenever they get married.

630
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.800
Or whenever they get recognized and some big way.

631
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.800
In the same way. Do you feel their pain?

632
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.100
When they're weeping over the loss of their job.

633
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.500
Over their failing grade, their marriage

634
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.100
is struggling.

635
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.100
Or they were caught doing something.

636
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.300
How it should be instead to bring it back to our

637
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.800
text. Is this your foot is happy for

638
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.100
your hand.

639
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.100
To get to hold the new baby.

640
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.700
or you're I

641
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.200
your ear is happy that your eye gets to see.

642
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.000
Your bride coming down the aisle.

643
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
That is harmony.

644
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.400
So we see in this passage today we serve because we're United

645
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.600
we're different we're designed and we

646
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.900
are harmonic.

647
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.500
Let's bring this home church. Let your serving

648
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.400
be motivated by gospel Harmony.

649
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.200
That's the last point of the day let your serving be

650
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.000
motivated by gospel Harmony.

651
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.500
Do you see that here in the text that Christ is

652
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.800
in such harmony with you and the

653
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.300
church that he calls himself the head and

654
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.500
you his body we see that same Harmony in

655
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:27.900
Acts 9.

656
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.200
When Jesus confronts Saul on the road to

657
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:31.900
Damascus.

658
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.500
Saul as you know is the infamous and

659
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.000
he's the murderous persecutor of the church

660
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.600
Nobody pummels the church more than Saul.

661
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.500
And yet, it's Jesus who feels that pain?

662
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.100
Jesus says to Saul saw why are you

663
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.000
persecuting me?

664
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.800
Not why are you persecuting my church?

665
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.100
Do you see how much he loves you Church?

666
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.500
Do you see how much he loves you you matter?

667
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.600
How do we do how do we respond to this then? Well, we we serve the

668
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.700
Lord with gladness.

669
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.700
And you don't serve him as though he needed anything

670
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.000
acts 17 says let's not

671
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.200
belittle the Creator God of the

672
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.400
universe by thinking that he needs us or

673
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.400
his purposes will somehow be thwarted.

674
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.600
Isaiah 46 says but we serve

675
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.900
him with joy because of who he is because

676
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.800
what he's done through Christ.

677
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.300
amen

678
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.100
And let's be United Church. Let's be United.

679
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.700
It's been said in a similar way.

680
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.700
But may we not be like the Corinthian Church?

681
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.700
Where we have the gospel?

682
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.000
But we fight over the smallest stuff.

683
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.700
While others don't have the gospel and need it

684
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.500
Do you see that?

685
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.600
Let's be United. Let's be United unbeliever. Do

686
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.300
you know that this same Saul who we know better as

687
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:14.600
Paul?

688
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.400
This murder this persecutor of the church is the same

689
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.200
Paul who wrote first Corinthians that

690
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:21.600
we read today.

691
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.600
Paul was knocked off his figurative high horse.

692
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.500
And he had an encounter with Jesus. We pray

693
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.600
that you have an encounter with Jesus, too.

694
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.700
This kind of massive reversal that we've seen in today's text

695
00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.100
where the low or brought high and high

696
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.200
I brought low. It's like nothing else in the

697
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.300
world and it's a picture of the Gospel.

698
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.800
Like Lindsey red at in Philippians 2 Jesus himself

699
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.300
was brought low and then he was highly exalted.

700
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.200
That images what we see here Paul shows

701
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.100
the power of the Gospel to bring

702
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.000
people who were low.

703
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.800
Hopelessly lost in isolated into

704
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.200
His Marvelous Light.

705
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.200
Where they are lifted high, they are

706
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.800
forever found and they are in the body of Christ.

707
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.400
And that can happen with you.

708
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.100
God is asking you today to trust in Jesus his

709
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.500
death means forgiveness for every one

710
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.400
of your sins. No matter what you've done.

711
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.400
If you turn away from your sins, and you

712
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.100
trust in Jesus as the Lord

713
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.100
of your life.

714
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.200
Become a part of this.

715
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.100
Become a part of the body of Christ.

716
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.000
If this is stirring something in you.

717
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.400
Please talk to one of us appeared down front after the

718
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.800
service. We'd love to talk with you about that.

719
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.400
The truth is this church.

720
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.300
To love him is to serve.

721
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.700
and unity with Christ

722
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.300
in unity with each other

723
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.300
drives why we serve
