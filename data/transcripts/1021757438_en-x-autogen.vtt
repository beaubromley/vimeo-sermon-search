1
00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.565
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.765
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:09.525
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:13.845
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:17.045
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.125
Good morning church. Happy Sunday.

7
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.365
It is awesome to be here with you.

8
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.485
Um, uh, my name is Brandon.

9
00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:33.805
I get to serve here in the student ministry

10
00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:36.285
and in the the residency program as well.

11
00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:38.605
And so as always, shout out to students.

12
00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:40.645
Um, yeah, they're the best.

13
00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:43.205
Uh, if you are new here, I just want to take some time

14
00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:44.405
to just say welcome.

15
00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:48.285
Uh, there are a lot of great churches in this area

16
00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.525
and if we can help you in any way, just show you

17
00:00:51.745 --> 00:00:54.565
and, uh, share who we are and what we're about.

18
00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:55.965
We'd love to help you in that process

19
00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:57.725
of, uh, finding a church.

20
00:00:57.785 --> 00:00:59.445
And there's a communication card

21
00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:01.565
and the seat back, uh, right in front of you.

22
00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:03.565
Or, uh, you can go out into the lobby

23
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:05.125
to our New Year section.

24
00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:07.245
Uh, if you meet a man named Jimmy,

25
00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:09.605
please tell him I said The bears are awful.

26
00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:13.245
Um, and if you meet someone named Amy, please tell her

27
00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:16.325
to tell Jimmy that the bears are awful.

28
00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:19.605
Um, but a little bit about me, uh, is

29
00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:21.285
that I grew up in a pretty quiet home.

30
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.205
Um, my, my father wasn't around.

31
00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.805
My mom worked two jobs and, and I was the only child.

32
00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:28.285
And so, so it was quiet for the most part.

33
00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:30.165
And as an only child,

34
00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:34.645
whenever I wasn't talking to the wall, uh, I caught myself,

35
00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:38.085
uh, getting fascinated by stories.

36
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.575
And so, you know, stories have a lot of different purposes.

37
00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:50.435
They can teach us things. They can help us remember things.

38
00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:54.855
They can give us something to, uh, believe in.

39
00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:57.345
And whether you're an only child

40
00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:59.745
or not, uh, no matter what your background is,

41
00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:03.025
everyone loves a good story.

42
00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:05.735
And so we've all grown up hearing stories.

43
00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:09.735
And you might be familiar with a famous story of

44
00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:14.695
a lumberjack and his rusty trusty sidekick

45
00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:16.735
ox Paul bunion.

46
00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:19.495
And babe, let's see if it's, yeah, I had

47
00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:22.175
to find the manliest picture I could of, of Paul Bunion.

48
00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:25.215
Uh, yeah. So there we go. Paul Bunion.

49
00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:26.815
And babe, you may remember the story.

50
00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:29.015
Well, uh, maybe you haven't heard the story

51
00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.855
of Paul Bunion since you were in second grade,

52
00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:33.695
and which whichever camp you fall in, don't worry.

53
00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:37.975
I'm gonna give you guys just a quick recap of who Paul is.

54
00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:41.095
Here's some things we learned from his life.

55
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:47.025
When Paul was a child, his breakfast would consist

56
00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:50.885
of milk, eggs, and potatoes.

57
00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.565
Normal breakfast. I know nothing special about that.

58
00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:56.605
But for Paul, his parents would need

59
00:02:56.605 --> 00:03:00.325
to provide at least 10 cows, 50 eggs

60
00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:05.445
and 10 potatoes a day to satisfy his hunger.

61
00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:09.605
Every day was bulking season for Paul.

62
00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:12.765
And Paul was so large that

63
00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.325
whenever he would roll out of bed,

64
00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:19.085
he would cause an earthquake to go through the entire town.

65
00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:23.885
And as he grew older, we see that Paul had the strength

66
00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:28.205
of 10 men and he was faster than the speed of light.

67
00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:32.735
And from this point on, it only seems fitting to refer to,

68
00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:34.655
refer to Paul as Mr.

69
00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:37.735
Bunion because if he is this strong

70
00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:39.055
and this powerful,

71
00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:42.095
then he deserves our respect and our reverence.

72
00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:44.765
Right? And as Mr.

73
00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:48.405
Bunyan's journeys continue, it is rumored that him

74
00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:51.725
and his sidekick ox, uh, dug out the Great Lakes

75
00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.965
and they, they, some say they were responsible

76
00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:58.645
for creating the Puget Sound just outside of Seattle.

77
00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:02.445
And along the way, they cleared the trees in North

78
00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:04.205
and South Dakota.

79
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.315
Mr. Bunion and Babe were a duo to be feared,

80
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.625
and they were so legendary

81
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.905
that people had even made songs about them.

82
00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:19.285
People will always be able to remember who Mr. Bunion was.

83
00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:23.335
And there are so many other stories

84
00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:27.255
that we grow up listening to that captivate our attention.

85
00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:30.955
They give us a character who does these, uh,

86
00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:34.595
miraculous things that just leave us in awe.

87
00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:38.635
Sometimes they do things so good that,

88
00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:40.635
that we write songs about them.

89
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.255
You can think of Frodo and Lord of the Rings

90
00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:47.655
or maybe even Han Solo when he made the Kels run

91
00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:49.535
and less than 12 Parex.

92
00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:52.735
And everyone loves and knows Spider-Man.

93
00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.015
And as amazing and as breathtaking

94
00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.625
as these stories are, they aren't real.

95
00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:04.785
Most of these stories are simply a fantasy.

96
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:08.915
Mr. Bunion did not roll out of bed

97
00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:11.595
and cause earthquakes and hurricanes.

98
00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:16.775
At best, he was probably just an above average lumberjack.

99
00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:19.215
These stories are simply exaggerations.

100
00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:24.255
But can I tell you about a story

101
00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:25.615
that is not an exaggeration?

102
00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:29.115
Can, can I tell you about something

103
00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:31.235
that has actually happened that should leave us

104
00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:34.205
in wonder in adoration?

105
00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.935
Can I, can I tell you about a moment that caused ASAP

106
00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:43.295
to write a song so that Israel would never forget?

107
00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:49.485
Please join me in Psalm 76 as we look at God's word together

108
00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:52.085
and see what he has done.

109
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.445
Psalm 76,

110
00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:08.215
God's word says this to the choir, master

111
00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:12.785
with stringed instruments, a psalm of asap,

112
00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:16.875
a song in Judah.

113
00:06:17.955 --> 00:06:22.435
God is known, his name is great in Israel.

114
00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.985
His abode has been established in Salem,

115
00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:30.625
his dwelling place in Zion.

116
00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:37.275
There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword,

117
00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:39.715
and the weapons of war.

118
00:06:44.265 --> 00:06:45.825
Glorious are you

119
00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:49.395
more majestic than the mountains full of prey?

120
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:53.335
The stout hearted were stripped of their spoil

121
00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:54.895
and they sank into sleep.

122
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:59.185
All the men of war went, were unable to hue their hands.

123
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.815
Etcher, rebuke, oh God of Jacob, both rider

124
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.495
and horse lay stunned.

125
00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:11.785
But you, you are to be feared.

126
00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:16.345
Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused

127
00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:19.295
from the heavens, you utter judgment.

128
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:24.855
The earth feared and was still when God arose

129
00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:26.215
to establish judgment,

130
00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:30.335
to save all the humble of the earth.

131
00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:36.645
Surely the wrath of man shall praise you.

132
00:07:37.815 --> 00:07:40.755
The remnant of wrath will, you will put on like a belt,

133
00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:45.095
make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them.

134
00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:50.155
Let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared,

135
00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:54.635
who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared

136
00:07:54.655 --> 00:07:56.915
by the kings of the earth.

137
00:07:57.005 --> 00:08:00.615
Let's pray. Lord, would you help us?

138
00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:04.005
Would you help us to Lord, see who you are?

139
00:08:05.665 --> 00:08:08.955
Lord, would you help us to respond accordingly?

140
00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:13.025
Lord, I pray for our hearts. God, would you transform them?

141
00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:16.465
Lord, let this not just be another thing that we do, God,

142
00:08:16.525 --> 00:08:18.105
but Lord, would you grow us

143
00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:20.585
into the image of your son Jesus.

144
00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:22.025
In your name we pray, amen.

145
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:26.265
So we see at first Lance that this is a song.

146
00:08:26.265 --> 00:08:30.265
We see that in the subscription we see, this is a song

147
00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:33.505
that is communicating what God has done.

148
00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:37.865
And this is a song that's based off of, based off a story.

149
00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:41.625
And so why has ASAP chosen to write a song

150
00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:44.105
and what is he seeking to communicate?

151
00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:48.095
Well, the first thing we should note is that we should see

152
00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:50.575
how ASAP sets the stage.

153
00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.815
We should see how ASAP sets the stage of this,

154
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.285
this story, this song.

155
00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:00.605
And, and as I read this text, I I can imagine

156
00:09:01.155 --> 00:09:04.885
Asaf getting all the people of Israel together and,

157
00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:08.205
and drawing them close as they were near a campfire,

158
00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:10.965
as he goes on about who God is.

159
00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.225
In the same way we have grown up hearing stories

160
00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:17.945
of fantasies, myth like Paul bunion

161
00:09:18.655 --> 00:09:21.585
here ASAP wants the people of God to come together

162
00:09:21.925 --> 00:09:24.625
and recount his wonderful deeds.

163
00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:29.215
And and I, uh, reading this, I think it's important to know

164
00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:32.335
that he doesn't seem to be, uh, teaching them something

165
00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:34.655
that they're completely unaware of.

166
00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:37.585
I think the opposite is true.

167
00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:42.225
ASAP expects his listeners to know who God is already

168
00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:45.085
He, he has come to know

169
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.045
that God is a household name at this point.

170
00:09:49.975 --> 00:09:51.155
We see that in verse one.

171
00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:54.355
He says, in Judah, God is known,

172
00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:59.235
but not only is he known, but his name is great

173
00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:01.945
and it isn't revealed just

174
00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:06.225
yet why his name is great, why he's known.

175
00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:10.255
But he's getting to that. And not only does he share

176
00:10:10.595 --> 00:10:13.455
who God is, but also where God is.

177
00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:17.375
We see that in verse two, that, uh, the Lord has chosen

178
00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:21.375
to establish himself in Salem and in Zion,

179
00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:25.455
and it's easy to just fly over, fly over verse two.

180
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.575
But of all the places the great

181
00:10:27.595 --> 00:10:31.375
and powerful known God would dwell, he chooses to dwell

182
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.415
with his people

183
00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:37.725
and ASAP wanted people to see this

184
00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:41.205
and to be reminded of who their God is

185
00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:43.725
and what he has done.

186
00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:48.685
And as he sets the stage, he references something

187
00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:50.165
that God has done in the past.

188
00:10:50.385 --> 00:10:52.405
We see that in verse three.

189
00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:56.885
He says there, he broke the flashing arrows, the shield,

190
00:10:57.265 --> 00:11:00.005
the sword, and the weapons of war.

191
00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:03.885
There seems to be some context to this psalm.

192
00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:06.595
There seems to be a situation

193
00:11:06.595 --> 00:11:10.515
where God fought a battle on behalf of his people.

194
00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.045
And the good news is, is that is a story

195
00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:15.805
that we see all throughout scripture.

196
00:11:17.325 --> 00:11:20.305
The not so good news is, is it may be harder for us to know

197
00:11:20.315 --> 00:11:24.625
where exactly he is referring to because it is so common.

198
00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:26.695
But there's a situation.

199
00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:31.815
But two Kings chapters 18 and 19 that looks very similar.

200
00:11:32.035 --> 00:11:35.495
And this could be where he's drawing this story from.

201
00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:37.015
We don't know for certain,

202
00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:40.295
but we are gonna go look at two Kings 18 and 19.

203
00:11:40.315 --> 00:11:41.535
And instead you have a bookmark.

204
00:11:41.595 --> 00:11:43.895
Go ahead and place it in Psalm 76

205
00:11:43.955 --> 00:11:46.735
and we're gonna look at two kings for a bit

206
00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:49.915
starting in verse 18.

207
00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:01.315
You are looking at chapters 18 and 19.

208
00:12:01.315 --> 00:12:02.955
And there's a lot in these chapters.

209
00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.595
We're not gonna look at every verse, uh,

210
00:12:04.675 --> 00:12:05.955
I just wanna highlight some of them

211
00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:08.475
and kind of summarize what we see.

212
00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:13.965
Two Kings 18, we are introduced

213
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.925
to a new king named Hezekiah.

214
00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:22.895
And we learn in two Kings 18 verse three, it says that

215
00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:27.735
speaking of Hezekiah, he did what was right in the eyes of

216
00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:32.755
the Lord according to all that David his father had done.

217
00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:36.675
And then if we keep moving in the text, we see

218
00:12:37.305 --> 00:12:41.715
that Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel,

219
00:12:42.335 --> 00:12:45.395
so that there were none like him among all the kings

220
00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:50.625
of Judah after him, nor among those who were before him.

221
00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:54.735
Not only does this text communicate

222
00:12:54.765 --> 00:12:58.415
that he trusted in the Lord, he trusted in Yahweh,

223
00:12:59.035 --> 00:13:01.855
but it even shows actions that he did as a king

224
00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:05.335
to show his trust, to show his faith in Yahweh.

225
00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:07.815
And we should remember the importance

226
00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:10.655
of him trusting in the Lord as the story progresses.

227
00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:14.435
So we're introduced to a king who trusts in the Lord above

228
00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:19.725
all things, but we're also introduced to a king.

229
00:13:20.845 --> 00:13:23.825
But the King of Assyria named Sin

230
00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:26.685
and the Assyrians, they,

231
00:13:26.685 --> 00:13:29.245
they were a powerful force at this time.

232
00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:33.005
We can see in the description in two Kings 18, nine

233
00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:36.845
and 12 of of their most recent conquest of Samaria

234
00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:39.565
and how they took it and took all the Israelites with them.

235
00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:44.845
But as mighty as this army was as mighty as the, the king

236
00:13:44.845 --> 00:13:49.605
of Assyria felt at the time, king Aki is choosing

237
00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:51.605
to rebel against them.

238
00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:56.705
Well, why is that? Because the text has made it clear

239
00:13:57.015 --> 00:13:59.545
that Hezekiah was going to trust in the Lord

240
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:04.625
above all things he was not going to submit

241
00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:06.225
to a king with a big army.

242
00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:10.835
And Sonka rib responded accordingly.

243
00:14:11.855 --> 00:14:15.315
And in most circles we see that not only is son the king,

244
00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:18.835
but he refers to himself as the great King.

245
00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:21.615
And this is what the messenger of the great king

246
00:14:21.615 --> 00:14:24.215
of Syria has to say to the people of Judah.

247
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:27.895
Starting in verse 28, look with me two kings

248
00:14:28.775 --> 00:14:31.095
1828.

249
00:14:32.135 --> 00:14:33.915
And as we read it, imagine how proud

250
00:14:34.055 --> 00:14:37.435
or stouts they might be communicating this message.

251
00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:41.995
Then the Rika stood

252
00:14:41.995 --> 00:14:46.035
and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah.

253
00:14:46.945 --> 00:14:50.835
Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria,

254
00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:56.675
thus says the king, do not let Hezekiah deceive you

255
00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:00.905
for he will not be able to deliver you out of my hands.

256
00:15:02.025 --> 00:15:05.085
Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh

257
00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:07.125
by saying Yahweh will surely deliver us.

258
00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:10.625
And this city will not be given into the hand

259
00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:12.185
of the king of Assyria.

260
00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:16.785
Do not listen to Zeki. For thus says the king of Assyria.

261
00:15:17.135 --> 00:15:19.025
Make your peace with me and come out to me.

262
00:15:19.655 --> 00:15:21.665
Then each one of you will eat of his own vine

263
00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:23.505
and each one of his own fery.

264
00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:26.985
And each one of you will drink the water of his own system

265
00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:31.425
until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,

266
00:15:32.025 --> 00:15:35.465
a land of grain and wine, a land of bread

267
00:15:35.485 --> 00:15:37.825
and vineyards, a land of olive trees

268
00:15:37.885 --> 00:15:40.785
and honey that you may live and not die.

269
00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:44.455
And do not listen to zeki when he misleads you by saying

270
00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:46.135
that Yahweh will deliver us.

271
00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:49.515
Has any of the gods

272
00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.115
of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand

273
00:15:52.115 --> 00:15:53.275
of the king of Assyria?

274
00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:56.625
Where are the gods of heath in our pod?

275
00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:01.105
Where are the gods of ship? Vem and Hena and Eva?

276
00:16:01.215 --> 00:16:03.025
Have they delivered Samaria out of my hands?

277
00:16:03.725 --> 00:16:05.465
Who among all the gods

278
00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.905
of the land have delivered their lands out of my hands

279
00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:11.265
that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hands?

280
00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:13.775
According to Sinna rib

281
00:16:13.775 --> 00:16:17.655
and all the Assyrians, there is nothing, there is no one

282
00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:21.095
who can deliver Jerusalem out of his hands.

283
00:16:22.425 --> 00:16:25.325
He refers back to the conquest of Samaria, any,

284
00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:28.085
and he asked, did anyone deliver them out of my hands

285
00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:30.745
because of this power?

286
00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:33.545
And because of this, the might he feels on top of the world,

287
00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.225
he feels like Jack in the Titanics.

288
00:16:36.325 --> 00:16:37.385
I'm the king of the world.

289
00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:44.515
And in some ways he, he's challenging Yahweh.

290
00:16:46.055 --> 00:16:50.915
He is seeking to stand before Yahweh and contend with him.

291
00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:58.095
Now, you can imagine how Hezekiah might have responded

292
00:16:58.095 --> 00:17:01.975
and all who heard this news, they saw

293
00:17:02.045 --> 00:17:03.295
what they were up against.

294
00:17:04.855 --> 00:17:08.545
They no doubt heard the stories of their recent conquest.

295
00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:13.945
So how did they respond? They knew this was beyond them.

296
00:17:14.085 --> 00:17:15.385
Did they give into Assyria?

297
00:17:16.245 --> 00:17:17.905
No, that's not the story that we see.

298
00:17:19.135 --> 00:17:21.905
They continue to trust in the Lord

299
00:17:22.765 --> 00:17:25.895
and they turn their face to God in prayer.

300
00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:29.455
They turn their face to the one who is mightier than this.

301
00:17:29.455 --> 00:17:31.255
So-called Great king

302
00:17:33.545 --> 00:17:36.285
has a guy continued to trust in Yahweh above

303
00:17:36.825 --> 00:17:40.965
all things he didn't trust in horses, in armies or chariots,

304
00:17:41.225 --> 00:17:42.605
but in the Lord.

305
00:17:43.705 --> 00:17:47.245
And this is how Yahweh responds in two kings, uh,

306
00:17:47.565 --> 00:17:48.845
19 versus six

307
00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:54.105
and seven, Isaiah said

308
00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:58.345
to them, say to your master, thus says the Lord,

309
00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:01.985
do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard

310
00:18:02.455 --> 00:18:03.985
with which the servants of the king

311
00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:05.865
of Assyria have revived me.

312
00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:10.305
Behold I will put a spirit in him so

313
00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:13.105
that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land

314
00:18:13.605 --> 00:18:17.545
and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.

315
00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:21.465
Yahweh intervenes.

316
00:18:23.075 --> 00:18:25.735
Yahweh sees the proud and he humbles them.

317
00:18:27.655 --> 00:18:30.995
Yahweh declares judgment on the evil doers.

318
00:18:31.095 --> 00:18:34.395
Yahweh hears the prayers of his people and he answers them.

319
00:18:34.855 --> 00:18:38.155
And if we go back to Psalm 76 verse one, we can see

320
00:18:38.215 --> 00:18:41.715
and believe if this is why God is known in Judah,

321
00:18:41.945 --> 00:18:44.435
this is why his name is great

322
00:18:45.935 --> 00:18:49.025
because there he broke the flashing garros there,

323
00:18:49.025 --> 00:18:51.785
he broke the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war.

324
00:18:52.405 --> 00:18:54.585
And we can see this is how the story ends

325
00:18:54.645 --> 00:18:59.465
for Assyria two Kings 1932 through 37.

326
00:19:01.335 --> 00:19:05.065
Therefore, thus says the Lord concerning the king of

327
00:19:05.975 --> 00:19:08.885
Assyria, he shall not come into this city

328
00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:12.365
or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield

329
00:19:12.465 --> 00:19:17.405
or cast up a siege mound against it by the way that he came

330
00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:19.725
by the same way he shall return

331
00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:22.565
and he shall not come into this city declares the Lord,

332
00:19:23.505 --> 00:19:27.485
for I will defend this city to save it for my own sake

333
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:29.565
and for the sake of my servant David.

334
00:19:30.915 --> 00:19:32.895
And that night, the angel of the Lord went out

335
00:19:32.895 --> 00:19:36.935
and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians

336
00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:39.605
when the people arose early in the morning,

337
00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.645
behold these were all dead bodies.

338
00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:47.265
The S rib King of Assyria departed and went home

339
00:19:47.265 --> 00:19:48.425
and lived at Nineveh.

340
00:19:49.245 --> 00:19:51.905
And as he was worshiping in the house of NIST rock, his God

341
00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.145
and a germane

342
00:19:53.445 --> 00:19:56.945
and Sha Azi, his son struck him down with the sword

343
00:19:56.965 --> 00:19:59.305
and escaped into the land of RA

344
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:03.025
and radan his son reigned in his place.

345
00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:05.525
So why does any of this matter?

346
00:20:05.915 --> 00:20:08.405
What does this have to do with our text in Psalm 76?

347
00:20:09.165 --> 00:20:13.135
Well, I believe ASAP wanted the people to see what God has

348
00:20:13.725 --> 00:20:18.475
done ASAP wanted them to see what Yahweh has

349
00:20:19.065 --> 00:20:23.385
done, knowing what God has done leads them

350
00:20:23.485 --> 00:20:24.945
to praise God.

351
00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:28.065
Knowing what God has done leads them to sing songs

352
00:20:28.405 --> 00:20:32.985
and to worship him like the legend of Mr.

353
00:20:33.085 --> 00:20:35.585
Bunion. But real, the the story

354
00:20:35.605 --> 00:20:40.265
of God's wondrous works is not one of fiction and fantasy,

355
00:20:41.635 --> 00:20:44.655
but one of reality and power.

356
00:20:45.835 --> 00:20:47.565
So let's jump back to Psalm 76

357
00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:50.685
and look at the imagery that is hus in verses four

358
00:20:50.955 --> 00:20:54.285
through six and see how it compares to

359
00:20:54.285 --> 00:20:55.805
what we just read in two kings,

360
00:20:58.165 --> 00:21:01.745
the song here says that Yahweh is more glorious

361
00:21:01.765 --> 00:21:04.905
and more majestic than the mountain's fool of prey.

362
00:21:05.775 --> 00:21:08.345
This could be referring to the multitude of their army

363
00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:09.465
that they were up against.

364
00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.485
We see here that the stout hearted were stripped

365
00:21:13.745 --> 00:21:17.005
of their spoil and they sank in to sleep.

366
00:21:18.405 --> 00:21:23.385
We see in two Kings 19 that 185,000 of them were struck down

367
00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:26.195
and they were all dead in the morning.

368
00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:30.045
We see that all the men of war were unable

369
00:21:30.065 --> 00:21:31.285
to use their hands.

370
00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:33.645
And what did the Lord say?

371
00:21:33.745 --> 00:21:36.125
He said that they shall not come into this city

372
00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:39.645
or shoot an arrow or come before with a shields.

373
00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:43.405
There was nothing that these men were able to do

374
00:21:43.405 --> 00:21:46.525
because of the rebuke of the Lord.

375
00:21:47.715 --> 00:21:50.085
They were all stunned.

376
00:21:52.265 --> 00:21:55.405
And this is what Yahweh has done

377
00:21:55.545 --> 00:21:58.005
and this is what ASAP wants the people to see

378
00:21:58.465 --> 00:21:59.685
and reflect on.

379
00:22:00.905 --> 00:22:02.365
And there's a purpose behind that.

380
00:22:02.425 --> 00:22:04.925
But before we get to that, I wanna just pause

381
00:22:05.025 --> 00:22:06.485
and ask a couple questions.

382
00:22:09.065 --> 00:22:12.805
Do you reflect on the things of God?

383
00:22:12.905 --> 00:22:17.165
Do you reflect on the things that God has done in your life?

384
00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:25.835
Have you ever found yourself in a situation like has Aki

385
00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:29.075
where it might have seemed like all hope was lost

386
00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:33.195
and it forced you to turn your face to God in prayer?

387
00:22:34.835 --> 00:22:36.815
And let me ask, do you ever go back

388
00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:38.255
and reflect on those moments

389
00:22:40.185 --> 00:22:42.365
and think about how Yahweh showed up?

390
00:22:45.295 --> 00:22:48.385
What is your story that testifies

391
00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:50.745
of God's faithfulness?

392
00:22:54.735 --> 00:22:57.315
And I want to challenge you to reflect on these things

393
00:22:57.345 --> 00:23:00.355
because it reflect on as often as possible

394
00:23:00.865 --> 00:23:04.195
because I myself suffer from something that has,

395
00:23:04.195 --> 00:23:08.725
has been self diagnosed, but I just can't remember it.

396
00:23:09.705 --> 00:23:13.325
And, and I'm this is, this is embarrassing actually.

397
00:23:13.665 --> 00:23:15.485
Uh, I'm forgetting what it, what it's called.

398
00:23:15.905 --> 00:23:18.205
Uh, John talked about it last week.

399
00:23:18.405 --> 00:23:19.885
I, I think about remembering

400
00:23:19.885 --> 00:23:22.845
and forgetting things, something to do with with God.

401
00:23:22.865 --> 00:23:25.045
Uh, yes. Spiritual amnesia. Yes.

402
00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:26.725
And if I had to guess,

403
00:23:27.985 --> 00:23:29.685
I'm probably not the only person in the room

404
00:23:30.145 --> 00:23:31.165
who suffers from that.

405
00:23:32.675 --> 00:23:35.255
I'm probably not the only person in this room who tends

406
00:23:35.275 --> 00:23:37.895
to forget what God has done.

407
00:23:39.155 --> 00:23:40.535
And I know for a fact

408
00:23:40.535 --> 00:23:42.135
that I'm not the only person in history

409
00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:44.495
because as I look through the Bible, I see people

410
00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:48.445
who are are constantly forgetting what God has done.

411
00:23:49.745 --> 00:23:52.165
We see it in the Exodus as the people are walking

412
00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:54.165
through the wilderness, they're grumbling

413
00:23:54.165 --> 00:23:56.165
and they're complaining and they want to go back

414
00:23:56.165 --> 00:23:59.565
to being enslaved after they just saw God do these

415
00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:00.725
wonderful deeds.

416
00:24:02.165 --> 00:24:05.145
We see it in the transition from Joshua to judges.

417
00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:09.065
We see a nation that followed the Lord, who made a covenant

418
00:24:09.095 --> 00:24:10.985
with the Lord at the very end

419
00:24:11.845 --> 00:24:13.665
and the next book we see in judges

420
00:24:13.845 --> 00:24:16.425
and it did not take long for them to do

421
00:24:16.425 --> 00:24:19.265
what was right in their own eyes.

422
00:24:21.195 --> 00:24:25.845
This is why we should reflect on what Yahweh has done.

423
00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:29.325
This is why ASAP wants the people to be reminded.

424
00:24:29.395 --> 00:24:32.485
This is why he writes this song of this story so

425
00:24:32.485 --> 00:24:36.765
that they will know and remember forever who Yahweh is.

426
00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:40.075
But he doesn't stop there.

427
00:24:41.525 --> 00:24:45.895
Look with me verses seven through nine, as we

428
00:24:46.635 --> 00:24:50.975
see why Yahweh has done it, we see

429
00:24:51.245 --> 00:24:52.735
what Yahweh has done,

430
00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:56.695
but why has Yahweh done it?

431
00:24:58.975 --> 00:25:01.795
In this text, we see a lot of powerful language.

432
00:25:04.235 --> 00:25:07.895
We see that at God's rebuke, both rider

433
00:25:07.955 --> 00:25:09.855
and horse lay stunned.

434
00:25:09.855 --> 00:25:14.675
We see that in in verse six, in verse seven,

435
00:25:14.935 --> 00:25:18.675
we see God's anger roused that when his anger is roused that

436
00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:21.435
that no one can stand before him.

437
00:25:24.455 --> 00:25:25.555
In verse eight

438
00:25:25.615 --> 00:25:28.395
and nine, we see that God had uttered judgment.

439
00:25:28.655 --> 00:25:33.435
And then in verse nine, we see God establish, come through

440
00:25:33.545 --> 00:25:35.395
with that judgment.

441
00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:39.775
And if the context of this psalm is actually what happened

442
00:25:39.775 --> 00:25:43.495
with King Hezekiah, then we see God wipe out one

443
00:25:43.495 --> 00:25:45.775
of the most powerful armies at that time.

444
00:25:47.795 --> 00:25:50.495
And here in this psalm, it seems like this act

445
00:25:50.495 --> 00:25:53.495
of judgment is something to be celebrated

446
00:25:53.555 --> 00:25:56.175
and to be remembered for generations to come

447
00:25:58.395 --> 00:26:00.935
and, and the reason why they are celebrating

448
00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:03.375
what God has done and reflecting on it is

449
00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:05.975
because of what we see in verse nine.

450
00:26:07.585 --> 00:26:11.855
Verse nine says this, when God arose

451
00:26:12.075 --> 00:26:16.695
to establish judgment to save all the humble of the earth,

452
00:26:18.485 --> 00:26:22.665
we see the purpose behind why Yahweh has done it.

453
00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:27.145
The all powerful God has used this power to save the humble

454
00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:30.425
of the earth and to deliver them out of the hand

455
00:26:30.525 --> 00:26:31.945
of their enemies.

456
00:26:33.385 --> 00:26:35.995
This is what we see in Hezekiah's life and his story.

457
00:26:36.175 --> 00:26:40.115
We see this, this humility shown as he trusts in the Lord,

458
00:26:40.575 --> 00:26:44.285
as he turns his face to him instead of trusting in himself,

459
00:26:45.295 --> 00:26:46.685
trust in Yahweh.

460
00:26:47.445 --> 00:26:49.625
But on the flip side, we see a king

461
00:26:49.765 --> 00:26:52.905
who doesn't trust in the Lord, who isn't very humble,

462
00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:55.465
who refers to himself as the great king

463
00:26:56.695 --> 00:26:59.195
and he stands against God, he contends with God.

464
00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:03.475
And Sinna Rip should have known that God is in the business

465
00:27:03.815 --> 00:27:06.635
of humbling, the proud and exalting the humble.

466
00:27:08.955 --> 00:27:13.855
But as I read this text, it, it seems very straightforward

467
00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:17.375
that God came to save a humble folk like us

468
00:27:18.195 --> 00:27:21.055
and judge the stout hearted who who live outside

469
00:27:21.195 --> 00:27:22.335
of these walls.

470
00:27:23.285 --> 00:27:25.055
This is why Yahweh has done it.

471
00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:28.405
He has done it to save a humble people like us.

472
00:27:28.545 --> 00:27:29.965
So let's, let's praise him.

473
00:27:32.065 --> 00:27:33.525
But as I read this text

474
00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:35.405
and I'm honest with myself, that's not me.

475
00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:39.245
When I look at verse nine nine when it says

476
00:27:39.265 --> 00:27:43.245
to save all the humble of the earth, that's not me.

477
00:27:44.765 --> 00:27:48.125
I am not a man who falls into the camp of humility,

478
00:27:48.345 --> 00:27:49.565
of humble of the earth.

479
00:27:50.785 --> 00:27:53.125
If I'm being honest with myself, I relate more

480
00:27:53.125 --> 00:27:55.325
with Sinna rib than King Hezekiah.

481
00:27:57.735 --> 00:27:59.615
I fall into the camp of the proud

482
00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:03.575
and God opposes the proud.

483
00:28:04.435 --> 00:28:05.895
And we see from this text

484
00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:09.015
and all throughout scripture that judgment is coming

485
00:28:09.115 --> 00:28:11.575
for the proud judgment is coming for those

486
00:28:11.675 --> 00:28:14.895
who stand in opposition of Yahweh.

487
00:28:15.955 --> 00:28:18.095
And so why has Yahweh done these acts?

488
00:28:18.635 --> 00:28:21.135
Why has Yahweh's anger been roused?

489
00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:25.845
Why is judgment coming to condemn the mighty

490
00:28:25.865 --> 00:28:27.645
and to save the humble?

491
00:28:29.235 --> 00:28:31.645
What that means is that judgment is coming.

492
00:28:31.705 --> 00:28:34.805
And I don't think the Psalm shies away from that

493
00:28:36.205 --> 00:28:39.445
judgment is coming for all those who are opposed

494
00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.205
to God.

495
00:28:42.775 --> 00:28:45.635
And scripture is clear that all have sinned

496
00:28:45.895 --> 00:28:48.355
and all have followed the prince of this world

497
00:28:48.615 --> 00:28:53.155
and disobedience, all of us stand in opposition to God.

498
00:28:55.955 --> 00:28:57.015
So what are we to do?

499
00:28:58.475 --> 00:29:01.415
How are we to sing a song that's late,

500
00:29:01.415 --> 00:29:03.855
that's laid out here in Psalm 76?

501
00:29:04.395 --> 00:29:07.775
How are we to celebrate what Yahweh has done

502
00:29:08.115 --> 00:29:13.015
and why he has done it when we stand guilty before him?

503
00:29:18.235 --> 00:29:21.255
Well, I believe the answer comes from

504
00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:26.375
a humble man, not Hezekiah,

505
00:29:27.205 --> 00:29:30.265
but someone who would come through the line of

506
00:29:31.425 --> 00:29:33.425
Hezekiah would come from his lineage

507
00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:36.105
and that someone is named Jesus.

508
00:29:37.285 --> 00:29:39.705
Here's what we learn about Jesus in Matthew one.

509
00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:44.375
Verse 21 says that she will bear a son

510
00:29:44.915 --> 00:29:47.735
and you shall call his name Jesus,

511
00:29:49.245 --> 00:29:53.265
for he will save his people from their sins.

512
00:29:55.385 --> 00:30:00.175
Jesus will save his people from their sins.

513
00:30:00.545 --> 00:30:03.615
Jesus will save us from our pride.

514
00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:07.535
Jesus will save us from the judgments of God the Father,

515
00:30:07.915 --> 00:30:10.935
by taking on the judgment of the Father.

516
00:30:12.695 --> 00:30:14.675
He did that by being the only man

517
00:30:14.675 --> 00:30:16.075
who walked in perfect humility.

518
00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:19.155
He did that by being the humble of the earth.

519
00:30:19.695 --> 00:30:22.635
He did that by walking in perfect obedience

520
00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:24.435
to God the Father.

521
00:30:25.895 --> 00:30:29.995
He constantly trusted in the Father above all things.

522
00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:34.475
And for that he deserves every blessing imaginable.

523
00:30:35.365 --> 00:30:38.265
But instead, we see that he willingly went to the cross

524
00:30:39.205 --> 00:30:43.145
and took on all the wrath of the Father that was due to us.

525
00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:49.645
He took on the judgment that we deserve so

526
00:30:49.645 --> 00:30:51.525
that we could be saved

527
00:30:51.585 --> 00:30:53.885
and be in right relationship with the Father.

528
00:30:54.065 --> 00:30:56.205
And if you are in this room today

529
00:30:56.705 --> 00:30:58.765
and you have confessed with your mouth

530
00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:01.325
and belief in your heart that Jesus is Lord

531
00:31:01.505 --> 00:31:03.885
and that God has raised him from the dead,

532
00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:05.645
then you will be saved.

533
00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.485
And then you can read Psalm 76 with great joy

534
00:31:09.825 --> 00:31:13.725
and celebrate what Yahweh has done and why he has done it.

535
00:31:14.555 --> 00:31:17.845
Because God is in the business of saving people,

536
00:31:18.105 --> 00:31:19.605
saving the humble because of

537
00:31:19.605 --> 00:31:22.005
what Christ has done on our behalf.

538
00:31:23.695 --> 00:31:27.275
So if all this is true, if Yahweh is the one

539
00:31:27.335 --> 00:31:29.195
who is more majestic

540
00:31:29.215 --> 00:31:31.835
and more glorious in the mountains full of prey,

541
00:31:32.695 --> 00:31:36.915
if at his rebuke both rider and horse lay stunned.

542
00:31:39.595 --> 00:31:43.735
If Yahweh has done all these things to save the humble

543
00:31:43.955 --> 00:31:48.015
of the earth, what should our response be?

544
00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:50.175
What is this song wanting us to see?

545
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:55.885
I believe Psalm 76 put puts all this in front of us so

546
00:31:55.885 --> 00:31:59.365
that we can see that Yahweh is the name

547
00:31:59.735 --> 00:32:01.525
above all names.

548
00:32:01.595 --> 00:32:04.325
That he is the one to be feared.

549
00:32:04.545 --> 00:32:08.165
Yes, he is the one to be feared.

550
00:32:08.165 --> 00:32:10.965
Let's look and see how this song wrap seven

551
00:32:11.065 --> 00:32:12.405
verses 10 through 12.

552
00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:18.375
Surely the wrath of man shall praise you, the remnant

553
00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:20.415
of wrath you will put on like a belt.

554
00:32:21.395 --> 00:32:24.365
Make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them.

555
00:32:25.345 --> 00:32:28.565
Let all around him bring gifts to him, is to him who is

556
00:32:28.565 --> 00:32:31.685
to be feared, who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is

557
00:32:31.685 --> 00:32:34.245
to be feared by the kings of the earth.

558
00:32:35.185 --> 00:32:37.965
In the same way we all growing up, we all grow up hearing

559
00:32:38.025 --> 00:32:40.485
and watching stories that take our breath away

560
00:32:40.905 --> 00:32:42.645
and leave us in awe.

561
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:47.455
The same way I joke about referring to Paul bunion as Mr.

562
00:32:47.635 --> 00:32:50.535
Bunion and saying that he should be feared.

563
00:32:51.725 --> 00:32:55.535
ASAP expects the people to be left in awe struck wonder of

564
00:32:55.535 --> 00:32:57.215
what Yahweh has done.

565
00:32:58.815 --> 00:33:02.475
We see in verse sin that the wrath of man shall praise you,

566
00:33:03.145 --> 00:33:05.075
meaning that Yahweh will be praised even

567
00:33:05.095 --> 00:33:07.595
by those whose intent was not to praise him.

568
00:33:08.565 --> 00:33:11.745
In verse 11, Asaf says that people should bring their vows

569
00:33:12.005 --> 00:33:15.065
and gifts before the one who is to be feared.

570
00:33:16.615 --> 00:33:19.465
Well, what does he mean when he talks about this word? Fear?

571
00:33:19.465 --> 00:33:20.905
What does it mean to fear the Lord?

572
00:33:22.515 --> 00:33:24.955
I don't think he desires people to be a people

573
00:33:25.055 --> 00:33:26.155
to be afraid of God.

574
00:33:26.295 --> 00:33:27.595
Not not God's people.

575
00:33:28.885 --> 00:33:31.785
But in Hebrews 1228 to 29, it says this,

576
00:33:33.015 --> 00:33:37.025
therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom

577
00:33:37.055 --> 00:33:38.345
that cannot be shaken

578
00:33:39.285 --> 00:33:41.825
and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship

579
00:33:41.975 --> 00:33:46.505
with reverence and awe for our God is a consuming fire,

580
00:33:47.745 --> 00:33:52.435
worship, reverence, and awe because his name is great,

581
00:33:53.105 --> 00:33:56.075
because he is glorious and majestic,

582
00:33:56.075 --> 00:33:58.995
because he arose to establish judgment

583
00:33:59.375 --> 00:34:02.155
and to save all those who are his

584
00:34:02.705 --> 00:34:05.675
because Yahweh is the name above all names.

585
00:34:06.055 --> 00:34:07.915
And this is a story to be remembered forever.

586
00:34:08.945 --> 00:34:11.555
This is a song that will be sung forever.

587
00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:16.115
This is a story that should leave us in awe

588
00:34:16.335 --> 00:34:19.155
and entice us to praise him forever.

589
00:34:21.275 --> 00:34:25.975
Psalm 76, in Judah, God is known,

590
00:34:27.305 --> 00:34:28.925
his name is great in Israel.

591
00:34:30.015 --> 00:34:32.515
His abode has been established in Salem,

592
00:34:33.995 --> 00:34:36.055
his dwelling place in Zion.

593
00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:40.805
There he broke the flashing garros to shield the sword

594
00:34:41.265 --> 00:34:42.365
and the weapons of war.

595
00:34:44.075 --> 00:34:45.395
Glorious are you

596
00:34:46.385 --> 00:34:48.595
more majestic than the mountains full of prey?

597
00:34:49.775 --> 00:34:51.715
The stout hearted were stripped of their spoil.

598
00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:53.955
They sank into their sleep.

599
00:34:54.915 --> 00:34:56.895
All the men of war were unable

600
00:34:56.915 --> 00:35:00.245
to use their hands at your rebuke.

601
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:03.205
Oh God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay Duns.

602
00:35:04.495 --> 00:35:09.195
But you, you are to be feared Who can stand

603
00:35:09.195 --> 00:35:13.915
before you when once your anger is roused from the heavens,

604
00:35:13.915 --> 00:35:14.915
you utter judgments.

605
00:35:15.685 --> 00:35:19.785
The earth feared and was still when God arose

606
00:35:19.845 --> 00:35:23.945
to establish judgment to save all the humble of the earth.

607
00:35:25.275 --> 00:35:27.295
Surely the wrath of man shall praise you.

608
00:35:27.915 --> 00:35:30.055
The remnant of wrath you'll put on like a belt.

609
00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:33.575
Make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them.

610
00:35:33.715 --> 00:35:37.525
Let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared,

611
00:35:38.545 --> 00:35:41.805
who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared

612
00:35:41.825 --> 00:35:43.445
by the kings of the earth.

613
00:35:43.495 --> 00:35:47.405
Let's pray. Lord, would you

614
00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:49.205
recapture our awe?

615
00:35:50.095 --> 00:35:51.525
Would you recapture our wonder?

616
00:35:53.065 --> 00:35:54.805
God, may we reflect on what you have done

617
00:35:54.805 --> 00:35:56.085
and why you have done it?

618
00:35:57.425 --> 00:35:58.965
May we sing your praises forever?

619
00:36:00.465 --> 00:36:01.925
And your name we pray, amen.
