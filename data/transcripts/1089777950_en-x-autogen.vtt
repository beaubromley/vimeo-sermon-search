WEBVTT

1
00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:35.865
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:37.745
Uh, my name's John, one of the pastors here.

3
00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:39.225
It's great to see you.

4
00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.425
Uh, this morning we're continuing a series we've begun a

5
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:46.625
couple weeks ago through the chapter of Romans 12,

6
00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:48.185
and it's called Realigned.

7
00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:51.465
And it's looking at what a transformed life in Christ

8
00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.825
actually looks like day to day.

9
00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:55.505
What does that even mean for us?

10
00:00:55.675 --> 00:00:59.385
Every moment as we get into it today, I'd love

11
00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:01.465
to tell you about one of the mentors in my life.

12
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.865
A man, most of you have no idea who it even is,

13
00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:07.785
but has made a massive impact on me.

14
00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:09.545
A man named Ryan Reese.

15
00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.785
Now Ryan, uh, moved to Fairview as I graduated high school

16
00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:15.745
when he became the youth pastor

17
00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:17.545
of a church there in Fairview.

18
00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:19.505
And, uh, it was the church that a bunch

19
00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:21.105
of my younger friends were going to.

20
00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.465
And so every time I would go home, I would hang out

21
00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:27.265
with them, which meant I hang out with him as well.

22
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:29.185
And so we just clicked really quickly.

23
00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:31.785
Uh, theology was new to me at the time,

24
00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:33.705
and so he was really deep in theology.

25
00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:36.385
So I was just growing and asking questions and,

26
00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:39.305
and it just developed over time, a really deep relationship.

27
00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:43.985
Well, years later after I'd then become a youth pastor in

28
00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:45.905
Stillwater, uh, that church,

29
00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:48.025
they invited me back to preach there.

30
00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:51.185
Now, it was one of my first sermons I'd ever preached.

31
00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.585
And let's just say it was a struggle.

32
00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:57.025
Uh, it was not one of my better sermons.

33
00:01:57.225 --> 00:01:59.665
I, I know I was just stumbling through it.

34
00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:04.585
Yet we go to lunch at my grandparents' house and invite Ryan

35
00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.745
and his wife over and at lunch we're sitting there

36
00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:10.785
and across the table from me, he looks across

37
00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:15.585
and he has a rye smile and a, a slight chuckle.

38
00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:19.025
And he says, you're gonna be a pastor someday.

39
00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:26.115
It just affirmed me. It honored me.

40
00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:30.245
See, here's what I didn't know at the time.

41
00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:33.685
I, I didn't know that that's what God wanted for my life.

42
00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:36.125
I was just doing ministry 'cause I kind

43
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:39.125
of defaulted into it, fell into it there in Stillwater

44
00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:41.765
and I was just sort of playing around and having a good time

45
00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:45.165
and had a, had a good purpose in the moment.

46
00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.565
But I didn't know what the future held.

47
00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:50.885
But he looked at me and affirmed and valued and,

48
00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:56.085
and looked at at my future and called me to something more.

49
00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:02.045
And maybe, maybe for you, it was a coach

50
00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:05.365
who spent some extra time helping develop you.

51
00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:06.885
Whenever things went home were hard.

52
00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:09.875
Or maybe it was a parent or a grandparent

53
00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:13.395
who just spoke life into you your whole life

54
00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.595
and you saw what God had.

55
00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:17.075
Or maybe it was a teacher

56
00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.635
or a friend who was looking at your life

57
00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:23.115
and said, here's, here's where I could see you going.

58
00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:26.315
Or Here's, here's what you're great at. Here's who you are.

59
00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:28.675
And affirming you and honoring you.

60
00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:33.235
The point is, Ryan saw great value in my life,

61
00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:39.565
even when I may not have seen it, he saw it.

62
00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:45.445
I start there because today we're gonna talk about how

63
00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:50.885
that kind of stuff should be normal within the church

64
00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:57.285
where every corner is filled with people affirming

65
00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:59.525
and encouraging and valuing

66
00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:04.485
and celebrating the gifts of each other, all pointing to

67
00:04:05.055 --> 00:04:08.805
God's purpose in real ways, in people's lives.

68
00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:14.345
If we were to take stock right now,

69
00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:16.505
how would we say we're doing at that church?

70
00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:20.305
How, how would we say we are doing at that?

71
00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:25.225
Are we really living out Ephesians 4 29 which says

72
00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:27.825
that no corrupting talk should come outta their mouth,

73
00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:29.985
but is only what is full of grace.

74
00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:34.305
Only what's going to build others up

75
00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:40.235
really towards God's purpose, speaking life into people

76
00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:43.435
for God's purpose, for them in their lives.

77
00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:46.435
God's will. How are we doing at that?

78
00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:48.115
Most of us, again, not just here

79
00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:51.435
but broad church experience in all of our lives, most of us

80
00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:55.275
have experienced the exact opposite of that, sadly,

81
00:04:57.435 --> 00:05:02.355
slander, backbiting, gossip, competing to try

82
00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:06.315
to win more and be honored more than everybody else

83
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:08.355
and put people down so you can be lifted up.

84
00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:10.475
That's what we've mostly experienced

85
00:05:10.535 --> 00:05:13.555
and that's why what we're gonna study today is so critical

86
00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:19.775
because the command we're gonna see in Romans 12 verse 10 is

87
00:05:20.075 --> 00:05:23.815
to outdo one another in showing honor.

88
00:05:25.165 --> 00:05:27.695
Like if we're gonna compete at anything, compete at this

89
00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:29.575
showing honor,

90
00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:36.295
outdoing each other in it, let's compete at that.

91
00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.055
Now, lemme just set a a bit of vision.

92
00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:42.855
We go into this today, just a little vision in our hearts

93
00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:47.375
of, of something that, that, just imagine the culture

94
00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:52.465
that we would have a church would have if this

95
00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:56.265
command was fully true of each one of us.

96
00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:00.775
Like what kind of atmosphere would that be? Right?

97
00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:03.095
Just think about that. How sweet that would be

98
00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:06.535
for everyone walking around competing at out,

99
00:06:06.535 --> 00:06:07.775
doing one another and showing honor

100
00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:10.215
that's incredible to be a part of.

101
00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:14.575
And so what we're gonna see today is a pathway to get there.

102
00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:18.175
God's word's gonna leave us a pathway,

103
00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:21.095
just a glimpse of it.

104
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:24.215
What it first means is that we must be humble

105
00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:26.775
before we would ever get there.

106
00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:29.695
We've gotta be humble in order to honor,

107
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:33.335
but then honor itself actually flows from God

108
00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:35.575
through us to others.

109
00:06:37.435 --> 00:06:38.895
That's how we get there.

110
00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:40.015
So let's start by praying

111
00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:41.695
and asking God to show us what he wants

112
00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:42.735
to show us in His word.

113
00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:46.415
Lord, we pray in desperation

114
00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:49.625
that we need you every hour.

115
00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:53.835
We need you. You are our defense,

116
00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:59.265
our righteousness, oh God, how we need you.

117
00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.835
And so we need you in this moment in your word

118
00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:05.715
that this is your word, not mine.

119
00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:09.795
This is not, not 10 steps to a better life.

120
00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:11.115
This is your word.

121
00:07:11.255 --> 00:07:14.835
And we trust your spirit to move through your word,

122
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:18.975
to change our hearts that we need you.

123
00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:22.135
God, we, we can't do this naturally.

124
00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:26.555
We just wanna compete and win and put others down.

125
00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:31.155
But Lord, change our hearts that we would be more honoring

126
00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:34.435
to one another because of who you are and what you've done.

127
00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:40.365
So help us God and change us God in Jesus' name. Amen.

128
00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:46.005
So again, this the phrase we're studying today, again,

129
00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:47.685
we're just taking pieces of Romans 12

130
00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:48.685
through the next few months.

131
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:53.765
The second half of verse 10 in Romans 12, it says,

132
00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:57.365
outdo one another in showing honor.

133
00:07:59.575 --> 00:08:01.355
Now there's some interesting words used here

134
00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.355
and I wanna focus first on that word honor.

135
00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:05.555
Not just because it's the subject to the message, but

136
00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:07.235
because it's a really deep,

137
00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:10.435
profound word in the original language.

138
00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:12.155
It's used a many times,

139
00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:14.275
probably a couple dozen times in the Bible.

140
00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:16.075
And it's used in a couple different ways.

141
00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:19.075
Like there's some nuanced meanings to it.

142
00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:23.115
First it's used as we might think it is honor in the sense

143
00:08:23.115 --> 00:08:27.515
of respecting someone that you honor them, which again,

144
00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:29.395
we kind of understand that inherently.

145
00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:30.995
But there's others as well.

146
00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:34.755
It's used in relation to nobility or,

147
00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:36.235
or specialness like a king.

148
00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:38.595
Or you know when you go to a a courtroom,

149
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:40.035
well not when you go, but when you

150
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:41.395
watch somebody in a courtroom, right?

151
00:08:41.665 --> 00:08:45.755
They talk to the judge, they say, your honor, right?

152
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:49.075
So that's a sense of there's a specialness to that person.

153
00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:53.315
A king, your honor. That's what that word is used as. Well.

154
00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:54.595
Now there's a third

155
00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:58.885
and it's used in the sense of dealing with money,

156
00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:01.605
like the cost of something

157
00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:06.525
or that you value this thing this much, that you're willing

158
00:09:06.525 --> 00:09:07.965
to pay this much for it.

159
00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.445
That's also honor.

160
00:09:11.195 --> 00:09:13.975
And so there's all of that wrapped into this word.

161
00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:19.225
But notice in Romans 1210, the orientation

162
00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:23.025
of the way it's used, here it is toward others.

163
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.365
Now, when we talk about value and specialness

164
00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.285
and all these things and, and your unique

165
00:09:30.285 --> 00:09:33.925
and all that stuff, most of us, let's just be clear, right?

166
00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:37.885
Most of us typically have no problem seeing ourselves

167
00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:40.605
as pretty special, as valuable.

168
00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:43.725
Like where, where do you think like

169
00:09:44.845 --> 00:09:46.405
participation trophies came from, right?

170
00:09:46.405 --> 00:09:48.485
Like kids these days. My generation, by the way,

171
00:09:48.665 --> 00:09:50.845
we lament participation trophies.

172
00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.765
Our parents, you're the ones who gave those to us.

173
00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:56.485
So it's not our fault we, but,

174
00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:59.005
but the kids get told you're special all the time.

175
00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:02.405
You're unique, you have something to give, right?

176
00:10:02.405 --> 00:10:04.885
They, we have no problem seeing ourselves that way.

177
00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:11.635
But do you see others as unique and valuable and special?

178
00:10:12.735 --> 00:10:16.195
Do you see others in an honoring kind of way?

179
00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:18.835
That's the rub. That's where it's gonna be a little harder

180
00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:22.475
because innate in us is not, it's not natural

181
00:10:23.815 --> 00:10:24.835
to honor others.

182
00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.675
We're we're competing that we wanna win. It's about us.

183
00:10:30.695 --> 00:10:32.195
So that's the point here. If we're going

184
00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:36.355
to actually apply this command, James says,

185
00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:38.355
don't just be hearers of the word, be doers of it.

186
00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:39.875
We're gonna actually command this,

187
00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:41.115
this command, we're gonna obey it.

188
00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:43.675
Outdo one another, showing honor. How do we get there?

189
00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:46.435
First, it starts with our humility.

190
00:10:48.535 --> 00:10:49.835
If we're going to do this

191
00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:54.755
and we should want to, it starts with our humility.

192
00:10:57.985 --> 00:10:59.705
'cause just think about it, right? If I'm gonna honor you

193
00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:03.645
as a person, if I'm gonna treat you as valuable,

194
00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:07.245
if I'm gonna respect you, if I'm gonna treat you as special,

195
00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:11.805
if I'm gonna value you, I've got to be humble first, right?

196
00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:17.705
Unless I'm lying, I have to be humble to actually do this,

197
00:11:17.805 --> 00:11:19.545
to see you as valuable.

198
00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:21.105
I can't think too highly of myself.

199
00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:24.105
I can't make my life all about me.

200
00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:27.145
If I'm going to honor you, I can't make it about me.

201
00:11:27.315 --> 00:11:30.065
Can't just be about self has to be about you,

202
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:32.525
which is a humble posture.

203
00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:37.865
I love how Philippians two frames this,

204
00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:42.225
especially Philippians two, verses three and four.

205
00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:44.505
This is the apostle Paul talking to the church in Philippi

206
00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:45.865
and he's saying, here's how you

207
00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:48.265
maintain unity within your church.

208
00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:51.805
The momentum is to fracture you.

209
00:11:52.265 --> 00:11:53.805
Here's how you maintain unity.

210
00:11:55.755 --> 00:11:57.325
This is what he said, verses three and four.

211
00:11:57.385 --> 00:12:01.845
He says, do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,

212
00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:05.735
but in humility, count others more

213
00:12:05.735 --> 00:12:06.935
significant than yourselves.

214
00:12:08.555 --> 00:12:10.975
Let each of you look not only to his own interests

215
00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:14.335
but also to the interests of others.

216
00:12:16.525 --> 00:12:19.695
Like doesn't that sound like honoring

217
00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:20.935
each other from Romans 12?

218
00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:25.015
It's the same concept, it's the same idea.

219
00:12:25.755 --> 00:12:30.655
And it starts with notice, it starts with a humble stance.

220
00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:36.055
It it starts with this, this idea, I'm not gonna try

221
00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:39.015
to push someone else down so that I'm raised up.

222
00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:40.895
I'm not self-focused.

223
00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:42.935
I'm not conceited where it's all about me.

224
00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.735
That's what he's saying. It starts there.

225
00:12:46.955 --> 00:12:49.215
And then it also is others focused.

226
00:12:50.695 --> 00:12:54.615
'cause he says building up the interests of others, right?

227
00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:55.975
That sounds like honor, doesn't it?

228
00:12:56.075 --> 00:13:01.015
I'm gonna honor, I'm gonna build you up as I sit back.

229
00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:05.645
Okay? So let's just apply this

230
00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:10.355
really simple way here in our day and age.

231
00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:17.595
What if instead of posturing with our wealth

232
00:13:18.895 --> 00:13:21.755
or our, our reputation

233
00:13:21.895 --> 00:13:24.995
or our abilities, like where we just kind

234
00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:25.995
of put ourselves forward

235
00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:27.835
and make sure everybody knows how wealthy we are,

236
00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:30.835
how amenable we are, how, how reputable we are,

237
00:13:30.855 --> 00:13:32.555
and we're just trying to make sure everybody knows

238
00:13:32.555 --> 00:13:34.755
and we're positioning ourselves in a way that

239
00:13:34.785 --> 00:13:36.395
that makes ourselves look really good.

240
00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:40.795
What if instead of posturing like that, each of us

241
00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:43.875
instead gave every effort

242
00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:46.595
to being the most humble person on the face of the earth.

243
00:13:48.505 --> 00:13:50.395
What if we put our efforts not

244
00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:53.155
to making ourselves look better or to look more prominent?

245
00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:55.995
And we gave our efforts to being more humble

246
00:13:57.135 --> 00:13:58.955
and that was our goal, that was our effort.

247
00:13:58.955 --> 00:14:03.785
What if we did that where our, our effort was

248
00:14:03.845 --> 00:14:08.555
to fade into the background, to elevate others

249
00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:12.115
above ourselves, to push other people

250
00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:14.595
forward so that they win?

251
00:14:17.345 --> 00:14:18.475
What if we were the guy

252
00:14:18.935 --> 00:14:20.035
or girl on the team

253
00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:24.555
who was most focused on the most assists in the game,

254
00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:28.675
rather than the most points in the game, right?

255
00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:30.955
You just become the the assist person

256
00:14:31.065 --> 00:14:33.595
because you know when you pass the ball

257
00:14:33.735 --> 00:14:35.435
and they make the shot, your team wins.

258
00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:37.555
But you don't have to make the shot.

259
00:14:37.555 --> 00:14:39.675
You just say, I'm gonna assist. I'm gonna be the assist guy.

260
00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:42.115
I'm gonna be the assist girl. Now I'm just gonna give my

261
00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:43.795
life away so that everybody else wins

262
00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:45.515
because I know when they win, I win.

263
00:14:48.885 --> 00:14:50.775
What kind of atmosphere would that create around here?

264
00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:57.465
What kind of atmosphere would that create if all

265
00:14:57.465 --> 00:15:00.425
of us are focused on honoring each other humbly

266
00:15:00.425 --> 00:15:02.745
and stepping back and saying, I'm not gonna be the first,

267
00:15:02.925 --> 00:15:05.585
I'm gonna be last and I'm gonna push everyone else forward

268
00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:07.025
and elevate others above myself.

269
00:15:07.025 --> 00:15:08.105
What kinda culture would that create?

270
00:15:08.165 --> 00:15:12.385
Now listen, I wanna encourage you as a church right now,

271
00:15:14.175 --> 00:15:16.425
I've been here seven years now this week

272
00:15:17.285 --> 00:15:19.975
and I have seen growth

273
00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:22.755
in us as a church.

274
00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:29.035
I know I've grown yet

275
00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:31.915
that growth for me has been a painful growth

276
00:15:34.415 --> 00:15:39.305
Because the Lord has used relational

277
00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:44.505
and even physical struggles to wean me off

278
00:15:44.685 --> 00:15:46.065
of self dependence.

279
00:15:50.305 --> 00:15:54.665
I, for so long in my life, I saw my gifts, my abilities,

280
00:15:55.805 --> 00:15:56.985
as somehow mine.

281
00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:00.805
Like therefore my benefit.

282
00:16:02.085 --> 00:16:06.605
I created them somehow mentally, physically, spiritually.

283
00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:08.485
Like they, they were, they were all about me

284
00:16:08.485 --> 00:16:09.765
and I was using them for myself.

285
00:16:09.825 --> 00:16:12.205
And that pride was crippling me.

286
00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:15.845
It was keeping me from what God had for my life.

287
00:16:16.985 --> 00:16:20.165
And so what God did over the last number of years

288
00:16:21.185 --> 00:16:24.325
was systematically stripped away my health,

289
00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:31.625
my church growth dreams stripped away.

290
00:16:31.765 --> 00:16:36.025
My selfish desire for no conflict, innate in me from

291
00:16:36.025 --> 00:16:37.945
before, right, from long ago was like,

292
00:16:37.945 --> 00:16:39.065
I wanna avoid conflict.

293
00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:40.785
And he's like, that's not how life works, man.

294
00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:42.745
That's not how ministry is.

295
00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:48.065
He stripped away all of those things. Why was he doing that?

296
00:16:48.325 --> 00:16:50.305
To draw me to himself.

297
00:16:56.365 --> 00:17:00.425
And so I've grown in this very area

298
00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:07.455
And again, I've seen us grow as a church in this very area.

299
00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:10.535
Like as a pastor and we as elders, we, we sit around

300
00:17:10.535 --> 00:17:12.135
and watch and we serve with of course,

301
00:17:12.195 --> 00:17:16.775
but just to, to observe so many humble men

302
00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:21.735
and women, setting aside selfish ambition

303
00:17:21.995 --> 00:17:25.495
and just saying, I'm gonna delight in serving one another

304
00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:27.935
even if nobody knows who I am or what I'm doing

305
00:17:28.035 --> 00:17:29.655
or anybody ever finds out about it.

306
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.735
I'm gonna serve in real quiet ways

307
00:17:32.035 --> 00:17:33.295
and push everybody forward.

308
00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:37.095
Like we sit back and we watch that happen

309
00:17:37.435 --> 00:17:42.015
and it fills our souls to watch that happen every day.

310
00:17:43.615 --> 00:17:45.055
'cause there are times that we know things

311
00:17:45.055 --> 00:17:48.535
that you are serving and doing that nobody else knows.

312
00:17:50.975 --> 00:17:54.075
And we are so encouraged by that. Praise God for that.

313
00:17:55.515 --> 00:17:58.615
We watch it, we see it. It is so encouraging.

314
00:17:58.715 --> 00:18:01.495
So praise God and and stay at it, right?

315
00:18:05.545 --> 00:18:07.165
Yet we're not finished growing, right?

316
00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.815
See, compared to a lot of people, a lot of churches we are,

317
00:18:14.225 --> 00:18:15.695
we're doing pretty well, right?

318
00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:18.655
We're, we're pretty vertical in this.

319
00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:22.745
So be encouraged,

320
00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:26.185
but also remember that compared to Christ,

321
00:18:26.485 --> 00:18:28.865
we have some realigning left to do.

322
00:18:31.265 --> 00:18:34.205
And so we can be content but never satisfied.

323
00:18:37.285 --> 00:18:38.745
So praise God for what he's done.

324
00:18:38.805 --> 00:18:40.705
But we are not finished yet.

325
00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:45.385
So lemme just challenge you with this today, tomorrow,

326
00:18:46.985 --> 00:18:51.375
every day in

327
00:18:51.745 --> 00:18:55.415
God's power, wrestle to the ground,

328
00:18:56.215 --> 00:18:59.735
whatever is left of your selfish prideful self.

329
00:19:01.165 --> 00:19:03.415
Like put it to death 'cause it's still there.

330
00:19:03.815 --> 00:19:05.615
I look at my heart every day

331
00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:07.455
and I'm like, yeah, that was pretty selfish.

332
00:19:08.165 --> 00:19:09.815
Yeah, that pride still creeps up.

333
00:19:11.135 --> 00:19:12.745
It's still there in every one of us.

334
00:19:13.845 --> 00:19:17.465
And so in God's power, wrestle it to the ground

335
00:19:17.885 --> 00:19:19.105
and put it to death

336
00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:22.915
because we want to be more humble.

337
00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:26.655
That's how it starts. That's where we have to begin.

338
00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:31.295
'cause what God will do with that is he'll humbly turn your

339
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:34.295
heart more towards honoring one another

340
00:19:34.835 --> 00:19:36.135
as your heart is more humble.

341
00:19:39.495 --> 00:19:40.915
So honor starts with humility.

342
00:19:42.135 --> 00:19:44.715
The second point today flows naturally outta that one.

343
00:19:45.345 --> 00:19:46.675
Because here's what happens.

344
00:19:47.115 --> 00:19:49.515
Whenever we say things like I just said head,

345
00:19:50.915 --> 00:19:52.165
there's a common pushback.

346
00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:57.285
There's this feeling that comes up. I feel it.

347
00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:02.185
I know it's there. Okay, so you're telling me this call

348
00:20:02.185 --> 00:20:03.345
to be humble, alright?

349
00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:05.265
I need to step back, step aside.

350
00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:06.585
I need to push people forward all this,

351
00:20:07.525 --> 00:20:09.985
but won't that make me a doormat?

352
00:20:12.005 --> 00:20:14.015
Like that means people are just gonna run over me,

353
00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:15.095
take advantage of me.

354
00:20:15.095 --> 00:20:16.815
That that's what, that's right.

355
00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:19.095
So, so you're telling me that's what I need to be now.

356
00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:26.205
Now will you get hurt at

357
00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:28.555
times, yes.

358
00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:34.325
Will you get taken advantage of at times? Yes.

359
00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.805
Jesus certainly did a number of times.

360
00:20:39.385 --> 00:20:40.565
So you'll be in good company.

361
00:20:43.115 --> 00:20:44.495
But, but here's what I want us to think about.

362
00:20:44.675 --> 00:20:48.365
Not not the negative consequences of what could happen.

363
00:20:49.655 --> 00:20:51.445
Think differently about this idea

364
00:20:51.995 --> 00:20:54.965
because the way God's word talks about honoring others is

365
00:20:55.035 --> 00:20:58.285
it's actually the best way to lead someone else.

366
00:21:01.435 --> 00:21:05.265
Honor leads through value

367
00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:09.645
like honor that we're talking about here is actually the way

368
00:21:09.645 --> 00:21:12.765
to lead as you value others.

369
00:21:16.135 --> 00:21:19.025
This gets to that definition talking about worth

370
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.265
and cost, right?

371
00:21:21.265 --> 00:21:23.225
There's a respect given to someone

372
00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:25.065
because you see their worth.

373
00:21:26.775 --> 00:21:29.235
Let me just remind you of one of our values as a church.

374
00:21:30.385 --> 00:21:32.075
It's the value of compelling love.

375
00:21:32.105 --> 00:21:33.355
It's how we phrased it here.

376
00:21:33.455 --> 00:21:37.555
We demonstrate the love of Jesus by respecting the dignity

377
00:21:37.815 --> 00:21:41.595
of every person, sacrificing for our neighbors

378
00:21:41.895 --> 00:21:45.035
and cultivating unity with our faith family.

379
00:21:47.435 --> 00:21:50.015
In other words, Jesus has loved us in this way.

380
00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:55.025
So we turn around and love others in this way. Simple.

381
00:21:57.835 --> 00:22:00.375
But that starts, remember Philippians two, that starts

382
00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:04.615
by seeing others as more significant than yourself

383
00:22:04.755 --> 00:22:09.055
by counting them as more valuable than yourself,

384
00:22:09.055 --> 00:22:11.575
that their value exceeds yours.

385
00:22:11.575 --> 00:22:13.255
Now, I'm not saying you're not valuable,

386
00:22:13.475 --> 00:22:15.895
I'm just saying you in your heart are counting them

387
00:22:16.235 --> 00:22:18.575
as more valuable than you are.

388
00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:21.095
More significant. Which only happens

389
00:22:23.335 --> 00:22:26.225
when you see them as the image bearer of God

390
00:22:26.225 --> 00:22:29.225
that they actually are right.

391
00:22:29.225 --> 00:22:33.185
That's the foundation here. It's a theological truth.

392
00:22:33.805 --> 00:22:36.785
All humans, no matter how far gone,

393
00:22:37.165 --> 00:22:40.305
all humans are created in the image of God.

394
00:22:41.825 --> 00:22:43.165
That's Genesis 1 27.

395
00:22:43.225 --> 00:22:44.645
All the way back at the beginning,

396
00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:48.045
what God said when creating humans, here's how it went.

397
00:22:48.345 --> 00:22:52.805
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God.

398
00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:55.325
He created him. Male and female, he created them.

399
00:22:55.455 --> 00:22:57.325
Every man and woman who's ever lived is

400
00:22:57.325 --> 00:22:58.445
created in the image of God.

401
00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:03.205
That's simple. Now, sin has tarnished that image.

402
00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:06.845
And so it's like looking in a foggy mirror like you,

403
00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:08.645
you open the shower door after shower

404
00:23:08.645 --> 00:23:10.485
and it's like the bathroom fills with steam

405
00:23:10.505 --> 00:23:11.605
and you can't see anything.

406
00:23:11.985 --> 00:23:13.725
You can see that there's still an image there,

407
00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:15.005
but it's really fuzzy.

408
00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:17.725
That's like we are as humans now.

409
00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:20.785
The image is still there.

410
00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:23.785
It's just tarnished and tainted and,

411
00:23:23.785 --> 00:23:25.785
and that you can't see it as clearly.

412
00:23:26.175 --> 00:23:27.705
It's the same way because of sin

413
00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:32.705
that has happened in us, but it's still there.

414
00:23:33.835 --> 00:23:37.105
Don't forget, it's still there in every person which demands

415
00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:39.425
respect and dignity given to that person

416
00:23:39.425 --> 00:23:41.145
because they're in the image of God.

417
00:23:42.125 --> 00:23:44.065
It doesn't mean you agree with everything they do

418
00:23:44.065 --> 00:23:46.365
because I don't even agree with myself all the time.

419
00:23:47.585 --> 00:23:50.605
It means you respect them and you show them dignity

420
00:23:50.605 --> 00:23:52.685
because it's an honor thing.

421
00:23:53.585 --> 00:23:56.645
As we've seen here. And here's what happens.

422
00:23:56.645 --> 00:23:57.925
When you treat people like that's true,

423
00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:01.175
they tend to follow you.

424
00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:05.955
They, they tend to listen more.

425
00:24:07.755 --> 00:24:11.165
Like there's a leadership principle here and,

426
00:24:11.165 --> 00:24:12.685
and so when you think about leadership,

427
00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:14.045
there's a couple different options.

428
00:24:14.105 --> 00:24:15.845
You have more than what I'm about to share.

429
00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:18.525
But here's just a few of them. How do you lead people?

430
00:24:18.525 --> 00:24:21.165
Well, you could lead people outta fear, get them to fear you

431
00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:24.325
and they'll follow you for a while.

432
00:24:26.335 --> 00:24:27.555
But the culture will be terrible

433
00:24:27.615 --> 00:24:29.075
and eventually that team will wanna quit.

434
00:24:30.855 --> 00:24:33.235
So it works one way.

435
00:24:35.215 --> 00:24:37.705
Another option is you could be like the self-proclaimed

436
00:24:37.705 --> 00:24:38.865
world's best boss

437
00:24:39.765 --> 00:24:42.625
who was asked if he would rather be feared or loved.

438
00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:44.265
He said, easy. Both.

439
00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:47.545
I would want people to be afraid of how much they love me.

440
00:24:50.955 --> 00:24:52.865
Maybe not best practice there,

441
00:24:53.045 --> 00:24:55.425
but in reality,

442
00:24:57.525 --> 00:24:59.545
the best way to lead people is to value them.

443
00:25:00.745 --> 00:25:05.485
To honor them like we see in Romans 1210

444
00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:09.895
to respect people, to treat them as the image

445
00:25:09.895 --> 00:25:11.135
of bear of God that they are.

446
00:25:11.195 --> 00:25:12.495
Now I know you're sitting there

447
00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:13.735
thinking, but I'm not a leader.

448
00:25:16.095 --> 00:25:17.465
Well, that might be true in the sense

449
00:25:17.465 --> 00:25:19.185
that you don't have a platform.

450
00:25:19.365 --> 00:25:21.505
You don't have a blue check by your name online.

451
00:25:21.765 --> 00:25:24.145
You don't have a title that makes you a leader.

452
00:25:24.255 --> 00:25:25.825
Okay, I get that. Sure.

453
00:25:26.605 --> 00:25:29.265
But you do have massive influence on others.

454
00:25:29.955 --> 00:25:34.795
Every one of us. 'cause the Bible talks about the church

455
00:25:34.935 --> 00:25:36.715
in such a way that we are

456
00:25:36.715 --> 00:25:39.955
to be leading one another toward Jesus.

457
00:25:42.005 --> 00:25:43.705
His good, pleasing and perfect will.

458
00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:45.665
Like that's what we're all called

459
00:25:45.885 --> 00:25:48.905
to help each other get towards and find direction towards.

460
00:25:48.905 --> 00:25:51.465
That's what we are leading each other,

461
00:25:52.025 --> 00:25:54.065
influencing each other towards that.

462
00:25:54.065 --> 00:25:55.345
And so let's just play it out.

463
00:25:55.345 --> 00:26:00.185
Imagine a world where there's negative things

464
00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:02.385
of what I've just talked about here, where the culture

465
00:26:02.965 --> 00:26:06.065
is one of each of us are discouraging one another.

466
00:26:06.215 --> 00:26:09.345
Each of us are posturing of how we can be this way

467
00:26:09.525 --> 00:26:12.985
or that we're climbing over each other to be prominent,

468
00:26:13.085 --> 00:26:14.625
to be in this position over that.

469
00:26:14.765 --> 00:26:16.785
And we wanna push you down so we win.

470
00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:19.385
Like imagine that's the culture. What's gonna happen?

471
00:26:21.745 --> 00:26:23.245
People will be pushed away from Jesus.

472
00:26:25.045 --> 00:26:26.825
Our kids might grow up

473
00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:28.105
and as soon as they're gone,

474
00:26:28.255 --> 00:26:30.025
they completely a abandon this thing

475
00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:31.065
because they're like, I don't want anything to

476
00:26:31.065 --> 00:26:32.265
part any part of that.

477
00:26:32.965 --> 00:26:36.845
That's a mess. And no one

478
00:26:37.315 --> 00:26:42.285
potentially pursues the path God has for them.

479
00:26:42.285 --> 00:26:43.965
Nobody sees value in them

480
00:26:43.965 --> 00:26:46.205
and so they don't see that they're valuable to God.

481
00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:48.525
Does it have to be that way?

482
00:26:48.585 --> 00:26:50.885
If the culture's bad, people can still come outta

483
00:26:50.885 --> 00:26:51.925
that and follow Jesus?

484
00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:55.285
Absolutely. But the likelihood is a lot lower.

485
00:26:58.295 --> 00:26:59.505
Imagine the other side of that.

486
00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:04.625
Imagine let's flip the script ripped to where every one

487
00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:06.305
of us is.

488
00:27:06.305 --> 00:27:08.585
Instead now valuing one another,

489
00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:11.945
we're championing each other's strengths.

490
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:15.985
We are celebrating people in what they're doing and good at.

491
00:27:16.175 --> 00:27:20.695
What happens then? Man, that's an attractive place to be.

492
00:27:20.835 --> 00:27:22.655
People are drawn to the Lord

493
00:27:22.655 --> 00:27:25.135
because they're seeing something that is not natural.

494
00:27:25.325 --> 00:27:27.215
They're seeing something that's supernatural,

495
00:27:27.285 --> 00:27:29.655
that only God can do through a group of people.

496
00:27:29.795 --> 00:27:31.135
And they're like, I wanna be a part of that.

497
00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:32.775
Not only 'cause it's encouraging, but

498
00:27:32.775 --> 00:27:34.415
because I see something different in you guys.

499
00:27:35.365 --> 00:27:38.945
People are drawn to the Lord and we see people called out

500
00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:42.585
and up to God's amazing plan for their life

501
00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:46.785
that God's got a purpose for every single person he created.

502
00:27:47.045 --> 00:27:48.305
And we can look at each other

503
00:27:48.305 --> 00:27:49.505
and say, here's what I see in you.

504
00:27:49.525 --> 00:27:51.425
Here's what I appreciate about you.

505
00:27:51.425 --> 00:27:52.905
Here's what I see God doing in your life.

506
00:27:52.925 --> 00:27:54.865
Here's where you could go. And we're calling that out.

507
00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:56.545
And more people are saying, man, I'm gonna do that.

508
00:27:56.865 --> 00:28:00.845
I think I can do that. Encouraging towards that, just like

509
00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:03.725
that guy sat across the table from me at lunch

510
00:28:03.865 --> 00:28:05.485
and said, you're gonna be a pastor someday.

511
00:28:05.685 --> 00:28:08.085
I didn't see it, But he did.

512
00:28:11.695 --> 00:28:14.655
So again, you doing this, when you

513
00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:17.135
and I take ownership

514
00:28:17.755 --> 00:28:20.135
and lead like this,

515
00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:24.695
that's influencing others towards God's purpose.

516
00:28:24.955 --> 00:28:28.035
For us, that's leadership.

517
00:28:28.895 --> 00:28:31.635
That's something we can be about as a church.

518
00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:37.795
I hope it painted a picture that's an appealing future.

519
00:28:41.185 --> 00:28:45.405
But here's what's interesting about this sermon series, just

520
00:28:45.405 --> 00:28:47.085
through Romans 12, taking piece by piece.

521
00:28:47.085 --> 00:28:48.645
Here's what interesting about, interesting about it.

522
00:28:49.705 --> 00:28:53.285
It seems like every week we come to the same point,

523
00:28:54.095 --> 00:28:58.245
about two thirds of the way through the sermon we,

524
00:28:58.245 --> 00:28:59.765
we paint this beautiful picture

525
00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:02.845
of whatever it is we've been talking about that day.

526
00:29:02.905 --> 00:29:06.405
And we look at Jesus in his perfect standard

527
00:29:06.505 --> 00:29:09.965
and we see how how great it looks for us

528
00:29:09.985 --> 00:29:11.605
to be living that out.

529
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.485
Like if we would realign ourselves to what Jesus did

530
00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:17.325
and how he lived it out, man, it would be so life giving.

531
00:29:17.595 --> 00:29:20.525
This would be a perfect place to be. We, we see that.

532
00:29:22.825 --> 00:29:27.725
But the question always comes up at this point, okay, how?

533
00:29:29.895 --> 00:29:31.955
How in the world do we ever get to that point?

534
00:29:31.955 --> 00:29:36.035
Because innate in us is competition is putting you down.

535
00:29:36.175 --> 00:29:39.195
So I win, right? That's, that's innate flesh stuff.

536
00:29:40.615 --> 00:29:44.965
So how do we ever get to delighting

537
00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:47.845
in showing honor to one another?

538
00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:52.235
How do we get to loving each other?

539
00:29:52.235 --> 00:29:54.715
Like Christ loved the church like,

540
00:29:54.715 --> 00:29:57.195
like Trevor talked about last year carrying last week

541
00:29:57.435 --> 00:29:58.755
carrying for each other, right?

542
00:29:58.895 --> 00:30:00.755
And and real tangible boys, how do we get there?

543
00:30:00.755 --> 00:30:03.475
Like those things come up every single time

544
00:30:03.495 --> 00:30:04.555
we hit this point.

545
00:30:07.235 --> 00:30:08.415
So how do we get to this honor?

546
00:30:10.815 --> 00:30:11.825
Well, here's the final point.

547
00:30:11.975 --> 00:30:15.065
It's gonna answer that question. Hopefully honor

548
00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:17.105
flows from honor.

549
00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:21.415
How do we ever get to this point?

550
00:30:21.565 --> 00:30:25.295
It's because honor flows from honor.

551
00:30:29.105 --> 00:30:30.595
Like when you pick up a dry sponge

552
00:30:30.615 --> 00:30:32.475
and squeeze it, that's pretty useless, right?

553
00:30:34.135 --> 00:30:35.955
We can't give what we don't have.

554
00:30:38.725 --> 00:30:42.155
So here's what I mean by that. Think back to

555
00:30:42.155 --> 00:30:43.355
that part of Philippians two.

556
00:30:43.355 --> 00:30:45.315
I read earlier how the church maintains unity.

557
00:30:45.455 --> 00:30:48.635
I'm gonna read it again. This is Philippians two.

558
00:30:48.635 --> 00:30:51.795
Verses three and four says, do nothing from selfish ambition

559
00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:53.635
or conceit, but in humility,

560
00:30:53.725 --> 00:30:55.995
count others more significant than yourselves.

561
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:58.955
Let each of you look not only to his own interests,

562
00:30:59.215 --> 00:31:01.635
but also to the interests of others.

563
00:31:02.965 --> 00:31:04.635
Again, that's the desired future.

564
00:31:04.775 --> 00:31:07.635
That's the picture painted of the way we should be.

565
00:31:08.665 --> 00:31:09.995
Well look at what happens next.

566
00:31:10.255 --> 00:31:14.395
In verse five, Have this mind

567
00:31:14.605 --> 00:31:18.235
among yourselves, which is yours in

568
00:31:18.575 --> 00:31:19.795
Christ Jesus.

569
00:31:22.995 --> 00:31:27.335
Did you see that? What he's saying there?

570
00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:33.035
He's like, think and act like I just described in verses

571
00:31:33.035 --> 00:31:37.015
three and four, humble self serving, others, looking

572
00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:38.055
to count others more significant.

573
00:31:38.235 --> 00:31:42.895
Do all of that. Verse five says,

574
00:31:43.045 --> 00:31:47.095
because you already have the mind to be able to do it.

575
00:31:50.215 --> 00:31:51.755
Now, verse five is so interesting

576
00:31:51.755 --> 00:31:54.435
because notice, it's like there's a command and a promise.

577
00:31:54.855 --> 00:31:57.035
He says, have this mind among yourselves.

578
00:31:57.575 --> 00:32:01.035
That's a command that basically he's saying

579
00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:02.155
think like Jesus.

580
00:32:04.635 --> 00:32:06.645
Well then you're thinking, well how? How can I do that?

581
00:32:06.965 --> 00:32:09.165
I then what does he finish with?

582
00:32:10.115 --> 00:32:12.045
Because you already have the mind of Christ.

583
00:32:13.215 --> 00:32:15.505
Have this mind in yourselves because you already have it.

584
00:32:16.805 --> 00:32:18.145
You can think like this.

585
00:32:18.285 --> 00:32:20.225
You can't act like what I just described,

586
00:32:20.295 --> 00:32:23.665
because you have the mind of Christ.

587
00:32:23.725 --> 00:32:25.785
Now, what he's saying is that if you are a believer,

588
00:32:26.005 --> 00:32:27.225
if you've turned from your sin

589
00:32:27.325 --> 00:32:30.305
and turned from yourself in Jesus for your salvation,

590
00:32:30.685 --> 00:32:33.545
you can now think like he thinks.

591
00:32:35.165 --> 00:32:36.265
You have the mind of Christ.

592
00:32:36.415 --> 00:32:41.005
Corinthians says, you, you can think

593
00:32:41.145 --> 00:32:42.245
and act like this.

594
00:32:42.305 --> 00:32:44.325
You can grow in your ability

595
00:32:44.585 --> 00:32:46.325
to understand what he wants you to do.

596
00:32:46.325 --> 00:32:47.765
It's what Romans 12, two said.

597
00:32:48.045 --> 00:32:50.885
Remember, you are not to be conformed to this world,

598
00:32:51.065 --> 00:32:53.885
but you're to be transformed by the renewal of your mind.

599
00:32:55.155 --> 00:32:57.325
That by testing you may discern what's the will of God,

600
00:32:57.595 --> 00:32:58.845
good, acceptable, and perfect.

601
00:33:00.785 --> 00:33:03.365
So again, you have the mind of Christ.

602
00:33:03.985 --> 00:33:07.605
Now you can grow in your renewal of

603
00:33:07.605 --> 00:33:09.165
that mind over time.

604
00:33:10.035 --> 00:33:13.885
That is how we begin to compete at out honoring one another.

605
00:33:16.665 --> 00:33:18.595
Because just stop and think for a second.

606
00:33:18.695 --> 00:33:23.355
How did Christ honor you? How did he honor people?

607
00:33:23.615 --> 00:33:25.755
He the mind of Christ is what we're talking about.

608
00:33:25.815 --> 00:33:27.395
So how did he do it?

609
00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:32.685
Well, he respected you enough

610
00:33:33.625 --> 00:33:36.485
and saw you as valuable enough

611
00:33:37.345 --> 00:33:41.205
to pay the highest price in order to redeem you.

612
00:33:44.425 --> 00:33:47.685
How did he do that? Well, Philippians two continues,

613
00:33:47.705 --> 00:33:49.125
verses six through eight,

614
00:33:49.125 --> 00:33:52.125
after five says, have this mind among yourselves,

615
00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:53.365
which is yours in Christ Jesus.

616
00:33:53.785 --> 00:33:57.925
Who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality

617
00:33:57.925 --> 00:34:00.245
with God a thing to be grasped or held onto.

618
00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:05.525
But he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,

619
00:34:06.415 --> 00:34:08.125
being born in the likeness of men

620
00:34:08.745 --> 00:34:10.165
and being found in human form.

621
00:34:10.505 --> 00:34:15.165
He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point

622
00:34:15.165 --> 00:34:17.565
of death, even death on a cross.

623
00:34:21.115 --> 00:34:25.305
Again, that was the value God placed on you.

624
00:34:27.575 --> 00:34:30.585
That was the price tag for your redemption.

625
00:34:32.435 --> 00:34:36.485
That was the honor he gave you by doing what he did.

626
00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:37.605
And there was no other way,

627
00:34:37.825 --> 00:34:41.165
no other sacrifice was sufficient to do what he did.

628
00:34:41.385 --> 00:34:45.525
He had to do it that way. That is honor.

629
00:34:46.625 --> 00:34:50.805
But hear me church, that then what Jesus did is our example

630
00:34:51.305 --> 00:34:53.405
and our motivation and our power

631
00:34:53.545 --> 00:34:57.125
to go about honoring one another as Christ has honored us.

632
00:34:59.325 --> 00:35:02.185
He humbled himself. He offered himself, he gave himself away

633
00:35:02.215 --> 00:35:03.945
because we're valuable to him.

634
00:35:04.175 --> 00:35:06.625
It's the same way we now can humble ourselves

635
00:35:06.845 --> 00:35:09.105
and serve one another and give ourselves away

636
00:35:09.105 --> 00:35:10.505
because we honor another.

637
00:35:12.525 --> 00:35:14.865
We lay aside. Just think about this, Jesus, what he did.

638
00:35:15.285 --> 00:35:20.185
Lay aside our privileges, our positions to serve others,

639
00:35:22.095 --> 00:35:24.895
counting them as more significant than ourselves,

640
00:35:27.845 --> 00:35:31.895
even dying to self in order to honor them.

641
00:35:34.205 --> 00:35:36.805
It's what Jesus did. It's

642
00:35:36.805 --> 00:35:38.085
what what we can then do for others.

643
00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:41.885
You see how that will create such an appealing, exciting,

644
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:44.685
sweet life-giving culture within a church.

645
00:35:47.675 --> 00:35:51.735
If all of us are doing that for one another, that is

646
00:35:52.755 --> 00:35:53.895
pretty incredible place

647
00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:55.455
that people would wanna be a part of.

648
00:36:00.745 --> 00:36:03.265
I didn't finish that section of Philippians two though,

649
00:36:06.255 --> 00:36:10.425
because to this point it might seem like we

650
00:36:10.425 --> 00:36:11.465
are the focus here.

651
00:36:13.605 --> 00:36:17.945
It might seem like Jesus did all that he did up

652
00:36:18.265 --> 00:36:19.625
to Philippians two, eight,

653
00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.225
and then he just fades into the background

654
00:36:24.975 --> 00:36:27.025
that in some way we don't need him anymore.

655
00:36:29.165 --> 00:36:30.855
Like what we can see in this.

656
00:36:30.915 --> 00:36:34.015
If we leave it here, it can start to puff us up a little bit

657
00:36:34.015 --> 00:36:35.535
that we don't really need Jesus.

658
00:36:35.595 --> 00:36:38.415
We just needed him to start this self-help cult.

659
00:36:38.635 --> 00:36:40.415
And then we can continue it on from here.

660
00:36:42.555 --> 00:36:46.845
That as long as we are enough, uh, honoring and encouraging

661
00:36:46.845 --> 00:36:48.165
and building each other up, man,

662
00:36:48.165 --> 00:36:49.205
we don't need Jesus anymore.

663
00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.785
Because if that's what it, what it is, if

664
00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:56.825
that's all it is, we don't need him.

665
00:36:56.885 --> 00:36:58.905
We can just make sure that we're being enough,

666
00:36:58.905 --> 00:37:00.265
honoring being enough, affirming

667
00:37:00.265 --> 00:37:01.265
and encouraging to each other.

668
00:37:01.455 --> 00:37:03.865
Yeah. Then we don't, okay, well

669
00:37:06.155 --> 00:37:07.625
let's finish Philippians two.

670
00:37:10.055 --> 00:37:11.695
'cause watch what happens after Jesus did

671
00:37:12.795 --> 00:37:14.495
in his incarnation, his perfect life,

672
00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:15.735
his sacrificial death on the cross.

673
00:37:15.735 --> 00:37:19.015
Watch what Jesus did and what happens.

674
00:37:19.645 --> 00:37:21.815
Philippians two verses nine through 11,

675
00:37:23.935 --> 00:37:26.145
therefore now again that's a,

676
00:37:26.225 --> 00:37:28.745
a really important word, links us back.

677
00:37:28.805 --> 00:37:33.625
It says, because of all that has just been said, all

678
00:37:33.625 --> 00:37:35.825
that Jesus did all that he's about all

679
00:37:35.825 --> 00:37:37.305
that he is, all of that.

680
00:37:37.575 --> 00:37:42.545
Therefore, God has highly exalted

681
00:37:42.545 --> 00:37:46.105
him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,

682
00:37:46.405 --> 00:37:47.825
so that at the name of Jesus,

683
00:37:47.995 --> 00:37:50.425
every niche should bow in heaven and on earth

684
00:37:50.425 --> 00:37:52.745
and under the earth and every tongue confess

685
00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:57.385
that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

686
00:37:58.965 --> 00:38:00.185
And so let me be clear.

687
00:38:01.475 --> 00:38:05.145
While it is important that all people are honored

688
00:38:05.455 --> 00:38:07.465
because they bear the image of God,

689
00:38:07.715 --> 00:38:10.745
there is only one name worthy of being worshiped.

690
00:38:12.045 --> 00:38:13.465
And that's the name of Jesus Christ.

691
00:38:14.695 --> 00:38:16.105
Like it's fine and important.

692
00:38:16.255 --> 00:38:18.585
It's commanded for us to honor each other,

693
00:38:18.885 --> 00:38:21.545
but we need to honor and praise and exalt

694
00:38:21.545 --> 00:38:25.145
and worship the one who this is all really about.

695
00:38:25.245 --> 00:38:28.175
That's Jesus, the God

696
00:38:28.175 --> 00:38:30.255
who humbled himself to live the perfect life.

697
00:38:30.255 --> 00:38:32.295
We couldn't live the God who died,

698
00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:35.725
the death we deserve the God who defeated the enemy of sin

699
00:38:35.725 --> 00:38:37.725
and death that we could never defeat on our own.

700
00:38:38.105 --> 00:38:41.165
That's why he is worthy of our honor.

701
00:38:41.225 --> 00:38:43.565
That's why he is worthy of our praise

702
00:38:43.825 --> 00:38:45.445
and He's worthy of our lives.

703
00:38:47.585 --> 00:38:51.005
And that's then how he's the power

704
00:38:51.425 --> 00:38:54.485
and motivation for us to turn around and honor one another.

705
00:38:55.075 --> 00:38:59.885
Like he's honored us. We desperately need him.

706
00:39:00.865 --> 00:39:03.085
We don't leave him behind so we can go honor each other

707
00:39:04.145 --> 00:39:05.165
and build each other up.

708
00:39:05.265 --> 00:39:09.605
We desperately need him to flow through us to honor others

709
00:39:09.825 --> 00:39:11.125
as he has honored us.

710
00:39:14.465 --> 00:39:15.525
And so it's a great place

711
00:39:15.525 --> 00:39:17.125
to be when people are honoring each other.

712
00:39:17.425 --> 00:39:20.605
Yes, but there's only one name worthy

713
00:39:21.585 --> 00:39:23.765
of our whole devotion, our whole lives.

714
00:39:24.835 --> 00:39:29.085
It's him. And so let's bow our heads together, if you would,

715
00:39:29.945 --> 00:39:32.765
and let's just reflect on that in His word

716
00:39:32.765 --> 00:39:33.765
and what he's done and

717
00:39:34.355 --> 00:39:36.565
what we've seen him speak and do today.

718
00:39:38.225 --> 00:39:42.805
Now, I'll just invite you to, to ask him a question.

719
00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:44.045
Simple.

720
00:39:48.705 --> 00:39:53.645
Say, God, I I want to be more stunned

721
00:39:53.865 --> 00:39:55.725
by what you have done for me.

722
00:39:58.905 --> 00:40:03.765
Can you help me? Like if this

723
00:40:03.765 --> 00:40:07.805
Philippians two picture of Jesus is true,

724
00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:11.445
we should be just dumbfounded by that.

725
00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:17.565
Amazed, stunned, overwhelmed by God

726
00:40:17.585 --> 00:40:18.445
who would do that

727
00:40:24.945 --> 00:40:27.285
for you, A sinner for me, a sinner.

728
00:40:27.545 --> 00:40:28.525
He would do that.

729
00:40:32.425 --> 00:40:35.605
Ask him to help just reawaken your heart

730
00:40:37.115 --> 00:40:38.365
towards those things today.

731
00:40:51.915 --> 00:40:56.015
And just in light of that, ask him to give you

732
00:40:56.895 --> 00:41:00.535
a renewed sense of how to honor others,

733
00:41:00.995 --> 00:41:02.655
to reorient your heart,

734
00:41:02.715 --> 00:41:05.975
to refocus your heart away from yourself, to get out

735
00:41:05.975 --> 00:41:10.695
of yourself and to think and consider others

736
00:41:16.685 --> 00:41:18.255
that your identity is secure in him.

737
00:41:18.995 --> 00:41:21.415
You don't have to posture, you don't have to position.

738
00:41:21.475 --> 00:41:24.495
You can just serve and fade into the background.

739
00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:29.495
Be unknown because you have a secure

740
00:41:30.055 --> 00:41:31.135
identity in him.

741
00:41:32.395 --> 00:41:35.085
Ask him to reorient your heart towards people like that.

742
00:41:43.565 --> 00:41:47.135
Lord, we need you. This is not natural to us.

743
00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.815
And so, Lord, we know it must be supernatural.

744
00:41:53.035 --> 00:41:57.095
You must do it. Pray you would in our hearts that that each

745
00:41:57.095 --> 00:42:00.135
of us would look around and look for ways to honor

746
00:42:00.235 --> 00:42:01.775
and ways to encourage

747
00:42:01.775 --> 00:42:03.335
and ways to celebrate each other,

748
00:42:05.075 --> 00:42:06.535
to outdo one another in that.

749
00:42:06.535 --> 00:42:08.095
Lord, I pray that would be culture here.

750
00:42:09.175 --> 00:42:11.775
I thank you that it already is in so many ways,

751
00:42:11.875 --> 00:42:15.895
but God may, may it just overflow out of here to

752
00:42:15.895 --> 00:42:18.335
where people around us can't help but see it.

753
00:42:25.315 --> 00:42:26.695
But that helps that that comes from,

754
00:42:26.805 --> 00:42:28.695
from seeing you first God as

755
00:42:28.715 --> 00:42:29.935
who you are and what you've done.

756
00:42:31.075 --> 00:42:32.495
So stun us with that reality.

757
00:42:33.995 --> 00:42:36.335
Awaken our affections for you more.

758
00:42:36.405 --> 00:42:40.655
Even as we sing, as we respond, as we live today,

759
00:42:40.675 --> 00:42:44.055
as we play volleyball, as we go to work, as we go to camp.

760
00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.975
Whatever it is, Lord, just stir our affections

761
00:42:47.035 --> 00:42:48.055
for you in those things.

762
00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:51.095
In Jesus' name, amen.

763
00:42:53.635 --> 00:42:56.455
And so we are gonna give an opportunity to sing in response

764
00:42:56.475 --> 00:42:59.535
to him in this moment here in a few seconds.

765
00:42:59.795 --> 00:43:03.855
But, but we also, we see the time

766
00:43:03.855 --> 00:43:06.495
of giving each week as that as well.

767
00:43:07.405 --> 00:43:10.775
It's not just collecting money, it's a sense

768
00:43:10.835 --> 00:43:12.415
of this is also worship.

769
00:43:12.645 --> 00:43:14.655
Worship's not just singing. This is also worship.

770
00:43:15.355 --> 00:43:18.775
And so whether it's in this moment, in the plates or online

771
00:43:18.915 --> 00:43:20.895
or in the boxes or during the week or

772
00:43:21.055 --> 00:43:23.975
whenever it is, it's, it's saying to God,

773
00:43:24.705 --> 00:43:25.815
which is what worship is.

774
00:43:25.845 --> 00:43:30.575
Same God, all, all, all of me is yours. I, I know nothing.

775
00:43:31.135 --> 00:43:33.615
I own nothing. This is all yours.

776
00:43:33.615 --> 00:43:35.775
And you're, you're giving me a chance to steward it.

777
00:43:35.795 --> 00:43:37.895
So I wanna steward it for your glory for others. Good.

778
00:43:37.895 --> 00:43:39.455
This is a way on by the way.

779
00:43:39.455 --> 00:43:42.335
This is a way to serve and to lift up,

780
00:43:42.385 --> 00:43:44.335
build others up just by giving.

781
00:43:46.485 --> 00:43:48.815
Just say this is for you, God. This is all yours.

782
00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:52.135
Anyway, I'm just gonna give it to you for your purposes.

783
00:43:52.395 --> 00:43:54.695
So I'm invite the ushers to come forward

784
00:43:54.755 --> 00:43:56.455
as we receive that now.

785
00:43:56.515 --> 00:43:57.855
But all the rest of us, if you are able,

786
00:43:57.855 --> 00:44:02.255
let's stand together and in our hearts respond

787
00:44:02.275 --> 00:44:06.095
to this God who's done all that He's done for us in honor.
