1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.800
So as we discussed last night.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.800
We were designed to be.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.800
connected on multiple levels

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
right in the two sessions that we had last time we

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.700
talked about.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
The design that we have to be connected emotionally

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.500
and physically and spiritually and

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.300
intellectually, right? We we

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.200
have that design but when life gets busy and

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.000
kind of can overwhelm us at times

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.200
disconnecting from

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.500
each other just happens. It's a it's a

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.400
slow fade. We don't intend to it just

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.400
overwhelms us and we can kind of

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.300
sink into ourselves we can do our alone time.

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.200
Those kinds of things we can sure do that and there's

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
nothing inherently wrong with that.

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.300
Right. It's just natural you have

19
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.300
children and you're pulled here pull there

20
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.100
and you have work and those kinds of things and it just

21
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.700
just naturally life just pulls you apart.

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.400
That's not a problem. That's not a

23
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
problem that happens with cancer signs. There's four teenage girls in my

24
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.200
house. We're kind of pulled away a lot

25
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.400
of times with this year for us.

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.400
It's been a challenging year for us and it's

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.600
just kind of this.

28
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.800
Slow fade now, it's not necessarily. It

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.000
has not necessarily been a problem because

30
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.500
when we notice it we share with

31
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.800
each other.

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.000
And in the sharing we just reconnect.

33
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.000
And we're just letting each other know. Hey, I'm still here.

34
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.400
I'm still here.

35
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.600
That's it. So normally.

36
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.100
When life gets busy and it kind

37
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.500
of pulls us apart. Normally we can just say hey, I'd

38
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
really like to spend some time with you and just come

39
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
back together and it's fine and on we go right we're

40
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.100
securely attached and we just reconnect with

41
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.400
each other.

42
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.600
but it's the moments that we

43
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.600
feel this disconnection

44
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.400
that when we're not able to

45
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.600
share it.

46
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.100
In a way, that's vulnerable.

47
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.600
And it's not received or understood in a

48
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.400
way. That's also vulnerable. That's when Trouble Comes.

49
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.600
that's when the

50
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.400
You know the the protests.

51
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.800
Start coming or if I try in a vulnerable way to connect

52
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.300
with you and early on this is what we do. We try to

53
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.200
connect with each other in some way. But when

54
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.200
that doesn't happen and then we Panic

55
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.600
right the alarm Bells go off then

56
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.300
we oh my goodness. Am I good enough for

57
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.000
you? Do you want to spend time with me can are

58
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.500
you accessible to me? Are you

59
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.200
responsive? Are you going to engage with me? If that's

60
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.900
begins to be a panic for us. This

61
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.200
is when the protest happens.

62
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.500
Right and it's not a stomping crying banging

63
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.300
that guy. It's not always that way. It's just

64
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.200
a little bit more of a drive for us

65
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.900
to connect.

66
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.400
and when that doesn't work now, we escalate that's

67
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.700
what we talked about in the what was happening to us last night what's

68
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.200
happened to us is we escalate it and when you

69
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.700
do that a few hundred thousand times

70
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.100
not even realizing it you begin to

71
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.000
Develop a very clear and predictable pattern. Like

72
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.500
I said driving home. You're lonely need

73
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.400
to connect but you know if I bring this up it's not going

74
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.200
to be accepted. So that's

75
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.500
this cycle. That's what we talked

76
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500
about last night.

77
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.300
So and it's in those moments really that the

78
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.400
enemy can intensify the attacks on.

79
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.300
It so this morning as we

80
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.200
seek to answer the final question. How do we reconnect?

81
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.200
I want to walk you back through the cycle pretty quickly

82
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.100
here and and I'm gonna use a case scenario kind

83
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.700
of to help you better understand

84
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.000
how it works because the

85
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.900
the biggest step a big

86
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.400
seven maybe not the biggest step a big step

87
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.900
to reconnecting is recognizing

88
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.500
this cycle at

89
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.600
work.

90
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.600
Right recognizing how it's working on us.

91
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.800
So I also want you to see just how fast it

92
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.200
can be just how fast right as I'm

93
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.200
working with couples and I'm talking to them and I'm asking them

94
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.200
kind of tell me a tell me tell me about your last week because

95
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.800
what I'm looking for is I'm looking for something to say. Oh, okay. Sounds

96
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.300
like man the sounds like the cycle came up for you

97
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.200
right here.

98
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.500
And it sounds like it kind of latched on to you right here and

99
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.400
they'll say well. Yeah, I did that well, and

100
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
what was that like for you? Well, then I did this. Oh no, but

101
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400
you missed a whole state. Hold on a second. Let me slow you down. What's when you

102
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.500
did this when when you did this what was happening for you? I'm

103
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.400
wanting them to really slow down and look below the

104
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.900
surface.

105
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.900
Pay attention to what's happening on the inside and that's what I'm hoping you're

106
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.300
doing as we're walking through

107
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.000
this and talking about this.

108
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.300
Is learning as you leave here. I want you to be able to pay attention even more

109
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.600
to What's Happening Here emotionally for us because what

110
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.500
happens for us dictates what we think and

111
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.700
do

112
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.900
right almost immediately.

113
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.300
So we must understand right? So

114
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.300
as we understand as we recognize this cycle, we must understand

115
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.400
just intellectually. We must understand

116
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.100
that we will never connect

117
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.300
the way we want to until

118
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.700
it's safe to do so.

119
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.100
Right, and it will never be safe for us to

120
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.100
do so until we realize what's happening.

121
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.300
Until we know the game. We're playing right the game that

122
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.600
we're playing that dance that we're dancing man. It's

123
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.300
awful dance. It's an it's an awful dance. It's a

124
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.200
it's a destructive dance. It's an awful game.

125
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.500
It's a game that seemingly changes the

126
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.300
rules on us, but it's it can be miserable for

127
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.900
us and it just puts a synonym is miserable place

128
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.400
where it can for sure.

129
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.700
And so this cycle is all about protection

130
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.600
this that's a key point. I want you to understand. This

131
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.100
cycle is all about you protecting yourself.

132
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.800
Right now there is an element deeply there's

133
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.500
an element to it of of protecting our

134
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.000
relationship.

135
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.800
Because if I'm protecting myself from the this feeling

136
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800
of not being good enough, but I can't share

137
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.000
with you. So I have to show it to you with anger irritation

138
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.500
or silence or something like that. What's really happening

139
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.200
for me? Is this question of disconnection of

140
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.300
of if I'm not good enough

141
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.900
for you.

142
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.600
You could find somebody who is.

143
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.200
So that's the this is the element of I'm trying

144
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.500
to save our relationship to not just protecting myself.

145
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.700
It is an element of protecting ourselves first, but

146
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.600
but there's always this core part that we

147
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.900
deal with as far as the the relationship goes. So

148
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.900
the problem is as because it's about protecting ourselves.

149
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.500
Then it puts our spouse in a place to have

150
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.400
to protect themselves right if I show up at your

151
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.000
house and I've got a gun

152
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.300
You're probably not just going to come right out and go. Hey, excuse

153
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.800
me. Can I help you?

154
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.300
You're probably not going to do that. Right? You're gonna want to come with a weapon.

155
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.300
You're gonna cut white Because You're Gonna Want to defend yourself.

156
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200
This is the issue is like your anger or your silence or

157
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.500
your criticism is just protection. It just doesn't

158
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.600
look like protection. It looks like a weapon.

159
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.100
And if you bring a weapon then he or

160
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.300
she's gonna have to defend themselves and

161
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.100
now you're both protecting each other or you're both

162
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.200
protecting yourselves from the other and in reality you're

163
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.100
trying to get closer together, but you're being pushed further apart. That's this is

164
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.900
this cycle when they protect themselves

165
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.700
from you and you protect yourself from them now,

166
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.400
we feel more alone than ever both sides. We

167
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.200
feel more alone. And this is what I'm Panic comes

168
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.900
up for us.

169
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.200
This cycle it's a never-ending and self-sustaining cycle.

170
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.200
It will feed itself.

171
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.800
Until we either recognize it and do

172
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.900
something about it, which is what we're talking about this morning or

173
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.700
until you're divorced.

174
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.600
Right because remember the enemy has one goal in

175
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.000
mind kill steal and destroy. Okay. So

176
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.200
looking at this cycle.

177
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.300
Let's go to this next sign looking at this cycle. Let's go back to those

178
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.400
core motions. If you have that cycle there in front of you. That's also helpful

179
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.800
as well. Looking at those look

180
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.400
at those core emotions there. And of course, I've only

181
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.500
listed a few here because these are these are the ones that I really pay

182
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.200
attention to and I realize that those are small, but I'm

183
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.300
hoping that everybody got a got a hand out.

184
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.600
There are many core emotions that get touched.

185
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.500
And it's important to understand what happens to us when

186
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.800
they do get touched.

187
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.100
Right. Obviously, we have the thoughts.

188
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.600
And then we're going to do or say something. This can

189
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.500
be especially important.

190
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.100
This can be especially difficult. Actually,

191
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.400
especially right

192
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.800
to pay attention identify. This is what I'm talking about.

193
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.600
This could be especially challenging for

194
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.200
those of the male gender on the funeral side

195
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.400
of 40. If you know what I mean, right? It's

196
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.100
a little more difficult for us mainly

197
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.100
because what I said last night we have been

198
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.700
trained to kind of disregard or distance ourselves from

199
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.700
those irrelevant or unnecessary emotions.

200
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.900
In a short and I say this all the time this and

201
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.600
primarily I'm speaking about me because I'm

202
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.700
52. I was

203
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.200
for the longest time and to

204
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.900
some degree still am emotionally retarded.

205
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.300
I need to learn I think most men kind of grow up and you

206
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.600
know, we learn in man school that these emotions are

207
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.700
irrelevant. And so we just grow up with not being

208
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.100
able to deal with them not knowing what to do with them. So it's

209
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.000
easy to distance ourselves and adapt and some way and be

210
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.200
The Logical reasonable one and those kinds of in pride ourselves

211
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.100
on that. So as we've been

212
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.300
trained to kind of stay away from those it that makes

213
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.600
it more challenging for us, but we desperately

214
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.500
need help to understand them. This is

215
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.200
why it's a big part of I think you the young man

216
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.600
over here you'd asked last night. Like is this a part of it identifying these

217
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.300
core emotions is helpful. Oh, this guy's got some

218
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.400
of those handouts. If you need the cycle in front of you, especially as

219
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.100
we kind of walk through that. Yeah right there to

220
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.200
you, right?

221
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.600
Okay, so so that brings me to the Second Step Right

222
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.600
recognizing this important recognizing that

223
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.700
the cycle is important recognizing how

224
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.400
it's working is important but the second step in reconnecting

225
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.700
is being able to identify and to communicate

226
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.700
those core emotions. We are

227
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.600
really good at thinking we

228
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.800
are really good at being intellectual. Like

229
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.100
I said, we pride ourselves on that but allowing

230
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.600
ourselves to actually feel the emotions

231
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.500
we feel is challenging and often

232
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.200
uncomfortable, right? This is why I mean

233
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.400
and you think about our culture

234
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.700
We are a culture of pain avoiders.

235
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.400
Right, we don't like pain which is

236
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.300
normal. It hurts. We don't like it and I'm

237
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.400
talking about physical pain. We don't like physical pain.

238
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.100
We especially don't like emotional pain. And so we

239
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.400
avoid that kind of we avoid

240
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.700
that that feeling so we don't allow ourselves to

241
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.100
sit in it and especially some of

242
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.400
those really vulnerable emotions of being

243
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.900
hurt or alone or unwanted or

244
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.300
rejected. We don't like sitting in

245
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.900
those so we get away from those for sure.

246
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.200
Myself personally, I don't know describing my

247
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.700
emotions when I'm feeling absolutely that's

248
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.800
that's what I'm talking about is for

249
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.200
me. We all feel them. That's what I want

250
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.500
you to get is we all feel them.

251
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.400
We just have a hard time knowing describing

252
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.500
what we feel.

253
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.300
This is what when the when you're the teenage

254
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.400
girls like or when we were all kids and all the girls would

255
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.600
go to the bathroom at the same time. They're talking about their feelings and they're we

256
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.200
don't do that.

257
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.300
We're not doing that right there. I'm

258
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.500
kidding. I don't know what they're talking about in.

259
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.200
there but

260
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.400
they right it's kind of the they're just they

261
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.100
just train each other that way right the kind of the universal the

262
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.700
kind of the the universal compassionate is

263
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.300
oh, right. They they women are

264
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.600
just so much better at that historically and not

265
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.400
all women because I've met in my practice plenty of

266
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.400
others that are very intellectual and want to

267
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.100
stay away from that as well.

268
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.200
But you're exactly right. The hardest part is really putting

269
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.400
a label to it and identifying

270
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.700
it and that's where

271
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.400
even asking hey and if

272
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.100
you and if you're feeling if you're in that camp.

273
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.400
And you are feeling something but you're not sure say that.

274
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.200
Tell your spouse you know, she may say hey what's happening for you? What's going

275
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.700
on? And you're like

276
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.200
something but I don't know.

277
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.400
I don't know what I'm feeling.

278
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.000
And and so then maybe trying to describe what it's like and

279
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.600
her helping you. They're really good at helping

280
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.400
us identify what these are so that

281
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.100
is a that's a big step.

282
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.100
So, like I said, we don't like to we don't like to be in it.

283
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.700
We don't like to feel those especially those those painful core

284
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.500
emotions. We like to stay away from those what's more

285
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.900
uncomfortable than actually feeling them is now

286
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.200
because it can be challenging if we don't know what

287
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.200
it is that we're sharing is actually to share those with each other.

288
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.500
That's that's where I know for me. The hardest

289
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.200
part is one. I don't want to look stupid, right? That's a big deal. I

290
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200
don't want to look stupid. And so

291
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.200
if I don't know what I'm feeling, but I know you're asking for

292
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.900
something you're going to get a deer in the headlights. Look.

293
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.300
Like I know something's happening for me, but

294
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.200
I don't know what it is. And so I just

295
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.200
shut it down or I walk away that's easy to do

296
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.900
that's protective, but it's disconnecting.

297
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.700
So so let me give you an example.

298
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.500
Of the cycle at work. I'm going to put up here. It's it's

299
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.900
a real example, but the names are the names

300
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.500
have been changed to protect the guilty here.

301
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.400
I guess in this kind of situation Corey

302
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.600
and April.

303
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.800
They've been married for 11 years in April's

304
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.600
more recently been concerned about the distance that

305
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.400
she feels between them. Their arguments have gotten

306
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.000
a little out of hand. This is what she said.

307
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.200
And they both recognize that something is wrong. This is what

308
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.300
this right in the quotes is what they're saying. Something is wrong.

309
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.900
It's not sure what it is. Probably like a lot of us.

310
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.500
They both believe they needed help for the last three or

311
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.200
four years, but they just put it off thinking. It's

312
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.300
going to be better. And in reality what I hear from a lot of couples I

313
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.100
used to you know, 10 15 years ago would hear that couples

314
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.900
would putting it off here like

315
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.400
three and four years a lot. But in reality

316
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.300
I've heard in the last 10 years. I've heard that we've waited four

317
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.200
five six eight years after they

318
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200
know they needed help to go get help.

319
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.100
So this is why I'm glad you're here. If you're in a

320
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.300
place where you need help a sign of a healthy individual is when you need help you

321
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.800
go get help.

322
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.200
And so if you need some help go get it. So it's kind of like them.

323
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.500
They just waited think it ought to be fine. We'll get through it. It's you

324
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.600
know, it's well, he's got something going on his life or she's

325
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.100
got something going on her life or whatever. We'll be fine. We'll get

326
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.300
through it, but they don't.

327
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.000
So they decided to come to therapy after April kind of

328
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.200
in a heated cut made a heated in a heat of a

329
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.500
moment made a comment that really kind of scared him and she

330
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.500
said something about her being done. I'm

331
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.100
done. I don't know how many times I've heard that in my office.

332
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.500
I'm done. I'm done with this.

333
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.300
And and so it's during our work together

334
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.300
what he States is all she does is criticize me.

335
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.600
It's pretty common. She's right. He just feels that and of

336
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.100
course that triggers her. No, it's not what I'm you know, but that's what

337
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.600
he's saying is he just feels criticized and she's States,

338
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.500
you know, everything I do upsets him. I can't do anything. He

339
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.500
just he gets upset and he walks away and

340
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.400
then then, you know as we

341
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.500
kind of get them calling down. She does say she loves him.

342
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.200
She loves him.

343
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.100
But she's at her Wit's End. She just doesn't know what to do. And so

344
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.300
you can kind of see kind of see that. You know, I've tried

345
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.400
to get to you. I've tried to try to try to knock knock you're not

346
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.700
coming. You're not showing up for me.

347
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.200
I'm done. I don't know what to do. I got to give up right

348
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.500
we feel like giving up at times.

349
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.000
and so

350
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.400
looking at this scenario kind of see it here the next

351
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.700
slide. Is that looking at this scenario the queue

352
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.400
there is this cue from April this

353
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.200
perceived distance that she

354
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.200
has and instantly right instantly.

355
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.900
She feels alone and isolated

356
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.000
and sad I'll give you I'll give you

357
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.700
an example of this just so you

358
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.500
can kind of see what I mean. Yeah, you know this summer has

359
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.700
been hot and dry and you know, there's times

360
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.500
in the afternoon and some of those really hot days there

361
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.400
in July, you stepped outside and blistering

362
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.400
heat and you just feel physically

363
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.300
on your skin and your face

364
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.200
and on your right you feel the heat right make sense.

365
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.300
You feel it and then immediately you'll have this thought.

366
00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.700
It's hot.

367
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.800
And then you'll say out loud. It's hot now how

368
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.600
that works is you walk outside US. Oh

369
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.100
so hot

370
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.700
And it seems like it's that fast. Well it

371
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.300
is but on the inside you have already felt

372
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.200
the heat you're nerve endings have processed into your

373
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.200
brain and you've you've interpreted that

374
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.500
as heat all that's hot on my skin you think

375
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.200
oh, it's hot and then you'll say it's so hot.

376
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.400
That fast that's how fast this distance can

377
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.200
happen right snake or stick.

378
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.200
remember

379
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:32.200
so

380
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.300
So she she senses or perceives this distance?

381
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.100
And she feels alone. She feels isolated and she

382
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.500
feels sad and because

383
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.500
This isn't the first time right the first

384
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.100
time she just felt a little.

385
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.300
Oh, I'm just a little lonely. It's not

386
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.400
a lot. It's not desperation. Lonely. It's just a little bit lonely

387
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.300
early on.

388
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.200
Right in year one or year two

389
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.200
or your feet three or whatever and so then at that

390
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.400
point, you know, she would move to him and it was easy. Hey, I'm really missing

391
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.000
you. Can we spend some time together? Can you want to go do something? You want to

392
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.100
go to a movie or you want to watch it show on TV or something? Like it's easy. Oh, yeah,

393
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.400
I'd love to do and so then I reconnect and that's easy or it's well, I

394
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.900
don't have time to that right now at some point it triggered for her right

395
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.100
that it was unable to and that sets off

396
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.000
a small alarm Bell.

397
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.300
And then they just keep going over the years as it

398
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.200
comes up. She begins to learn when I reach for him.

399
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.600
When I see this when I feel this distance.

400
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.700
The loneliness just reappears and it's more powerful and

401
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.500
more profound than it was the last time right because

402
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.400
it's going to escalate.

403
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.600
For them, so she instantly feels this immediately the

404
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.500
thought is yeah. This is just like all the other times. He

405
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.700
doesn't want to be with me. He never wants to spend time with me.

406
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.300
He's too busy for me. I'm not important for him.

407
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.400
I don't know what all the thoughts are very similar to something along those

408
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:55.700
lines.

409
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.300
And then she protects those core emotions with the

410
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.700
like an irritation right even a frustration

411
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.000
or for her. It's an irritation on this side, right? She

412
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.300
protects those and then in a critical manner,

413
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.800
she says what she's thinking.

414
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.800
You never want to spend time with me.

415
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.100
Well, seeing as that doesn't

416
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.500
sound very warm and cozy to him doesn't sound

417
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.500
very warm and inviting to him. It doesn't say. Oh, yeah, you

418
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.000
really are lonely and you really want me he immediately

419
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.400
feels inadequate right? So that's for the

420
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.700
Arrow coming back down it hits him in the belly you feel inadequate

421
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.100
and then his thought is

422
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.000
nothing I ever do is right.

423
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.400
I'm never going to be able to please her.

424
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.300
Just like that. It happens.

425
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.700
And then he covers up his feeling with frustration.

426
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.600
And he walks away.

427
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:47.600
right

428
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.700
Now her feeling is she feels abandoned next

429
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.700
slide add to it. Just compounding that

430
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.700
she's more alone more unwanted more

431
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.300
isolated now add to that

432
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.100
abandonment on top of all of those other things.

433
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.000
She's feeling the abandonment.

434
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:08.900
and

435
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.500
added to the course of the unwantedness not

436
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.000
being wanted.

437
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.100
Covers that up with anger because now she's got to be seen right.

438
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.300
I've got to be seen I got to make

439
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.100
myself bigger to be seen and to be

440
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:25.500
heard.

441
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.000
And so around they go again.

442
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.100
And you know until I'm not talking to you

443
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.600
shutting down and then she eventually just separates it.

444
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.000
But then In the Heat of one of these arguments, this

445
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.300
is where it comes up for her. I'm done.

446
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.200
I'm done with this.

447
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.300
so

448
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.800
Any of the sound familiar?

449
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.100
You don't have to nod you just in your own in your

450
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.100
brain. Does it sound familiar? Does it feel familiar?

451
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.600
As you're thinking about this.

452
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.900
This is where for me my heart breaks for them.

453
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.100
Because doing what I do.

454
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.100
I get to see I see it. I see it happening and

455
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.200
the sadness for me is they don't see it

456
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.600
happening yet. And I desperately want them to see

457
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.800
this. I desperately want you to see this.

458
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.300
Because there's something happening and always

459
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.400
have to point out to them if he's so awful if he

460
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.300
never wants to be beside you if she is trying to

461
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.300
ruin your life. Why in the world are they sitting here with you on

462
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.700
the couch in my office trying to figure out

463
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.700
how to make this thing work?

464
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.600
If they didn't care, they wouldn't be here. If you

465
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.800
didn't care you wouldn't be here.

466
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.400
tonight today this morning, whatever we're

467
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.000
Okay.

468
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.600
So it all happened all this happens to all of us at one time

469
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.800
or another right we go we all encounter this.

470
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.100
And it's simply like I said last night, it's the

471
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.400
outcome of this long-standing cycle. It's the product of this happening

472
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.400
to us and some of you for years and

473
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.300
years and years. I worked with couples that in there. They're

474
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.600
30s. I got a couple now they've been married. I think they've been married 40.

475
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.200
To for something like that. I want to say it's like 10 years

476
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.400
longer than me. So it's about that long for them and they've

477
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.500
been and as we're talking about it. They're like this this goes

478
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.500
back for us into the 1980s for

479
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.600
them. They remember how long this

480
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.200
has been happening for them and never any idea.

481
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.800
What was happening, so?

482
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.200
So recognizing the cycle at work and

483
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.300
recognizing that is is this force that

484
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.000
says don't be vulnerable.

485
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.200
don't

486
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.400
open up your heart don't share what's happening for

487
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.700
you. Don't do that for whatever reason don't

488
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.800
do that. That's scary. They're gonna think you're soft.

489
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.700
They're gonna think you're weak. They're gonna think you're needy

490
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.600
and dependent don't don't do that. Don't share it that Force.

491
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.900
Is the cycle at work and so recognizing this

492
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.100
is crucial the it's the

493
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.300
first it's the first huge step this identifying it

494
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.600
and then being able to communicate what's happening to each other

495
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.400
these core emotions. That's the next

496
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.000
big step the third big step is

497
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.300
that we must identify our position in

498
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.300
the cycle. So if you look

499
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.200
on your cycle the position is this is what we

500
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.100
do, right? This is what we do or this is what we say. It's

501
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.400
For us to know and to

502
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.900
understand how we respond.

503
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.600
when those core emotions get touched, right what

504
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.400
I do or what I say if I walk away or

505
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.400
if I get angry or my critical or whatever understanding

506
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.500
that position is crucial

507
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.400
the second piece of

508
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.700
this is even

509
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.400
more crucial and that is taking ownership

510
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.000
of what you do and you're

511
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.600
in those moments.

512
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.500
When you say something or do something when

513
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.200
you walk away taking ownership?

514
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.700
Of that position is crucial.

515
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.300
Because in that moment taking ownership of what you

516
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.700
do or say and the impact on your

517
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.800
spouse makes you safer.

518
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.100
Right often use an example of

519
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.200
my office like if if you walk in the door and I punch you

520
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.900
in the nose. Not only

521
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.200
not not only do you

522
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.100
feel the physical pain there?

523
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.000
And I need to recognize the the

524
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.300
physical pain and what I've

525
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.400
caused you but I also need to understand the impact

526
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.200
of that on you and the impact

527
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.200
of that not only is the physical pain you feel but now

528
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.300
the lack of trust that you have in me, right? I get it's a

529
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.700
dumb example, but you get the idea.

530
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.100
I have to understand the impact on you. And

531
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.100
so for us to take ownership makes us safer often

532
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.800
use the example.

533
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.500
I'm not a NASCAR guy at all. I don't know NASCAR and

534
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.100
Tony Stewart. Maybe I don't remember he I don't know if you

535
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.200
know if he's still alive or not. I have no idea but the idea think about

536
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.400
if you know a NASCAR guy or whatever think about this, let's say did

537
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.300
anybody have a 16 year old driver? Anybody have

538
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.500
a brand new or you got a 16 year old driver? Okay, right. Okay good. Someone

539
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.300
use him or hers an example. Let's say

540
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.700
let's say Dad they say

541
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.400
hey, let's go down to Texas Motor

542
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.400
Speedway and let's jump in one of those race cars and let me take you around the track

543
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.000
at 220 miles from an hour you in.

544
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.100
You with your teenager.

545
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.300
We not with your teenager.

546
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.300
Come on.

547
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.500
I got mine. No way not at 220

548
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.100
miles an hour not with them.

549
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.400
They're not they don't handle their vehicle there. They're not

550
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.200
gonna be able to handle the turns and it's going to be it's going

551
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.200
to end in a fiery crash. Right just a hundred percent. But let's

552
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.400
say, you know like 12 times. Let's say

553
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.800
I'm a 12 time NASCAR champion and I call you and go. Hey, I'm gonna

554
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.000
be in town. We're all friends. Why don't you

555
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.500
come down? Let's put you in the cart. Let's go around. Are you in then?

556
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.100
I'm in.

557
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.300
Man, I'm in why what is the difference?

558
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.800
I trust you to handle that vehicle that

559
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.600
vessel.

560
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.100
Going around that track 220 miles an hour.

561
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.000
You could use does that make sense? You can use I can

562
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.300
use an example of let's say about I've never let's say

563
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.300
I've never shot a gun before and I say hey, let's go shooting. Come on.

564
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:39.600
Let's go.

565
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.200
No, no, I'm not. I'm not I'm not going

566
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.500
you're not gonna come with me. But let's say I'm like

567
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:47.700
a

568
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.300
Champion shooter I'm a sniper

569
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.900
in the military whatever something like that, right, you know, you've experienced

570
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.200
and it's a hey let's go shooting. Oh, yeah, you're

571
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.500
in you want to go because you know, I'm safe

572
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.300
with that vessel.

573
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.500
This is what our vessel for showing what's

574
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.400
happening down here for us is what we do or say

575
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.700
and when we become safe with that because we've

576
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.300
acknowledged.

577
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.900
The impact of what I do and say on you it

578
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.000
makes me safer. Does that make sense? Can you

579
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.400
kind of kind of feel that?

580
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.000
is your position is your

581
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.200
position in the cycle one of anger or

582
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.700
aggression

583
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.000
is your position that you suppress these

584
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.800
emotions and is your position this super logical

585
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.200
and robotic type kind

586
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.200
of cold but but robotic is that your position

587
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.700
or do you freeze up and shut down?

588
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.700
Identifying your your response. What is

589
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.900
it that we that I typically do in those

590
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.400
moments and owning the fact that

591
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.300
what I do has an impact on you in your

592
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.100
gut.

593
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.700
right understanding that and owning that

594
00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.200
makes me immediately makes me safer for

595
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:09.400
them.

596
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.100
To be able to show up and to be present for

597
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.200
me.

598
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:15.700
Does that make sense?

599
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.100
Okay.

600
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.400
Now as we come to this the fourth step here.

601
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.200
This really is the most challenging and this is one that I'm

602
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.400
really going to try to.

603
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.000
Spend some time on.

604
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.600
It's the most challenging step.

605
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.800
to reconnecting

606
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.700
by far the most challenging step to reconnecting.

607
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.700
And so I want to show you a video that I

608
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.700
think kind of accurately depicts.

609
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.100
How challenging this is and kind

610
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.500
of what it's like to.

611
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.100
Move toward each other. Okay, so watch.

612
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.700
It's gone.

613
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.600
Go to pay he got to

614
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.400
play one. No wonder you.

615
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.300
Let her come to me.

616
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.600
I have crossed the Horizon to find

617
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:22.800
you.

618
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.600
I know your

619
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.200
name they have stolen the heart from inside you.

620
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.000
But this does not define you.

621
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.100
know

622
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.100
Who You Are

623
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.400
You truly are.

624
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:27.400
if

625
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.000
Man, there is so much.

626
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.600
in that

627
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.500
the fourth step

628
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.700
in

629
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.900
reconnecting with each other is to be able

630
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.400
to show up emotionally for

631
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.600
them

632
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.600
emotional presence

633
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.700
Is the key to love?

634
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.600
It's the critical step.

635
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:48.800
for us

636
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.500
if we're to be able to stop the enemy from destroying our

637
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:52.700
marriage.

638
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.000
So if you look at this.

639
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.400
in this video

640
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.100
to call

641
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.000
is the angry one, right?

642
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.600
her real name was to feedy but

643
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.600
you see she was lonely and isolated over there.

644
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.200
And safe, right she was safe from other people,

645
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.300
but she was also isolated from other people and they

646
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.100
were safe from her because of the water around her. She

647
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.300
couldn't go across that right? And so the little guy

648
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.200
I don't know his names a little demigod or something whatever they call him in

649
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.400
the in the show how people typically show up

650
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.200
for the angry one is like that right? Oh, right, they're

651
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.000
gonna whatever he was doing. He's like, I'm gonna fight you.

652
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.800
I'm gonna fight you back.

653
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.400
Right, and so I'm gonna throw this

654
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:44.900
Fireball here.

655
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.100
And then what Moana does?

656
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.500
is she's like, oh

657
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.100
they've stolen your heart.

658
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.000
It's not who you are.

659
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.500
And then she makes it safe for to feed

660
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.200
to cough to come to her and she

661
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.500
takes the steps.

662
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.200
Toward her right opens it up.

663
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.800
That's pretty vulnerable.

664
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.000
That's showing up.

665
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.600
And it's and it's being able to I just

666
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.200
imagine Moana being able to see the anger and go and

667
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.000
I know what that is. That's not who you are.

668
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.400
They've stolen the heart inside you.

669
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.300
And in a relationship I've stolen your heart.

670
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.300
And made you covered up with all that anger and made you

671
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.300
protect yourself that way and recognizing that I need

672
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.400
to step toward you.

673
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.200
As you come to me, even if you come to me in anger, I need

674
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.700
to be able to step towards you.

675
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.300
Vulnerably, right because there's no weapons

676
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.600
for her.

677
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.200
The other guy was going to fight her muscles and everything. She's like I'm

678
00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.400
I'm here.

679
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.200
And as he as she recognizes that

680
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.300
moana's safe, right

681
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.600
and then hears that's not who you are. Do you see the eyebrows?

682
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.600
Whoo, it's like immediately like that baby last

683
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:02.800
night. Oh,

684
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.400
except it's like wait a minute. Something's happening. What is this? But it

685
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.000
wasn't scary and then

686
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.000
she goes dark right cools off.

687
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.000
And then they touch and then she replaces her

688
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.200
heart. She's like I get you. I understand you I'm here

689
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.200
for you. I showed up for you and then look what

690
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:22.600
happened.

691
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.100
That is the transformation that happens in a relationship

692
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.000
when we show up for each other emotionally. That's

693
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.200
really challenging. So we're gonna talk about that. I'm kind of

694
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.600
walk you through how to do this.

695
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.100
Here in just a just a minute.

696
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.000
so to do this

697
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.000
it takes vulnerability.

698
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.300
Right took Moana being vulnerable to do that.

699
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.500
This is you and your spouse.

700
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.400
Vulnerability is not very high on your priority list at this

701
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.700
point protection is right because you've you've

702
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.200
been robbed of this.

703
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.900
That's what the enemy has done to you is none to

704
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.300
all of us. He's robbed us of our

705
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.500
vulnerability our ability to be soft and

706
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.300
tender and open and transparent with you. So we put

707
00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.700
on our fig leaves we cover up and protect ourselves.

708
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.300
So practically it looks like it looks

709
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.400
like you taking a step just like she did taking

710
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.700
a step and demonstrating verbally.

711
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.300
And understanding of what your spouse

712
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.500
is going through what they're doing or what they're

713
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.600
saying making sense of their anger.

714
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.300
To do that like I said last night if you if you

715
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.900
keep in mind that all Behavior makes sense in context

716
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.300
you've got to be able to make sense of

717
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.800
it. And so placing it in its proper context. Now's

718
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.600
like oh Moana I see the context there.

719
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.900
You've had your heart stolen you're angry

720
00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.100
and you isolated in your loan and you

721
00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.700
need connection. I'm gonna move towards you recognizing that

722
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.500
what you've been seeing or hearing from your spouse is

723
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.400
not that it's something else right? That's

724
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.400
the superhero super power that I

725
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.600
wanted you to I want you to have

726
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:12.800
practically

727
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.200
practically it means making sense of the

728
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.500
anger and seeing her exempt for

729
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.400
an example if she's angry makes seeing her

730
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.600
as attempting attempting to be significant in

731
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.000
your life.

732
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.400
It's making sense of his silence and seeing him

733
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.800
as scared to make a wrong move.

734
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.100
That's pretty typical for guys. We don't want to make a wrong

735
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:37.400
move.

736
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.200
In this the scenario, it's seeing April's

737
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.600
criticism of Corey.

738
00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.600
As her being desperate for him to come and

739
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.100
show her how important she is to him.

740
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.900
And it's seen Cory walking away.

741
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:54.600
as being

742
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.200
afraid he'll never be good enough for

743
00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:58.300
her.

744
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.100
So this kind of presence is very challenging.

745
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.000
Mainly because stepping toward our spouse.

746
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.400
means understanding

747
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.200
Kind of what's happening for them or at least seeking to

748
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:15.600
understand?

749
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.800
What they're feeling despite our senses telling them it's dangerous.

750
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.700
Right. Oh, it's there's this dangerous. This is bad territory

751
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.300
for me. Scary territory for me. I don't want to move into that moving toward

752
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.500
them anyway, and seeking to understand what's happening for

753
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.300
them. Even if you don't know and even if you don't know yourself, what's happening

754
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.200
and you say I don't know. I don't know. What's happening here

755
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.200
for me. I don't know what I'm feeling. I don't know this.

756
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.600
But I'm feeling something. Can you help me understand? What's happening

757
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.500
moving toward each other that way.

758
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.800
Okay, so can does it make sense?

759
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.200
What I'm saying about this being a vulnerable position to

760
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.600
take it's so

761
00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.500
easy with our friends.

762
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.200
It's so easy with our friends to understand like it's so easy.

763
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.100
You know if your spouse is or if your friend is

764
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.800
telling you you know, the two of you you guys are out and she says

765
00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.200
to you. My husband just doesn't

766
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.200
want to spend any time to me kind of using your example. He's always working on his car.

767
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.000
He said money spending time for me and she's gonna be

768
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.100
able to look, you know, I know that so awful.

769
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.100
Right and you've like, yes it is and you just

770
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.000
feel heard and understood.

771
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.600
You're not to fix anything. You just have to understand it that's

772
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600
showing up.

773
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.300
Emotionally you can do that with your friends. You can do that with family you do

774
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.200
that, you know a lot of some family maybe unless you're

775
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.500
anyway, so you can do that for a

776
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.600
lot of people it's just more challenging with your spouse because our

777
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.800
friends are not attachment figures for us.

778
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.900
Our spouse is

779
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.900
it's the one designed for us.

780
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.300
so I hope it makes sense that this is a vulnerable position

781
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.000
to

782
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.400
It's like Moana facing taka in

783
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.200
the video many of you have probably felt like that. Like you've

784
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.000
probably seen like the person like this person you married. I don't

785
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.000
know who you are anymore. I'm gonna call you another name because that is

786
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.000
scary for me.

787
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.400
Our loneliness or our fear our pain comes out as anger.

788
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.300
And that's terrifying.

789
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.600
But when we show up emotionally for them when we

790
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.200
see their anger as something protective.

791
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200
rather than dangerous

792
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.200
If they can let their guard down.

793
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.800
They don't have to now they don't have to be defensive because you show

794
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.200
up as their teammate.

795
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.200
You show up as their helper you show up

796
00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.500
as their protector.

797
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.900
And they're better able to let their guard down the big problem with this

798
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.900
is because our anger has been so scary or

799
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.600
our distance has been so lonely

800
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.200
for us.

801
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.700
Moving toward them is terrifying and

802
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.100
it takes incredible courage.

803
00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.700
right, it takes incredible courage, so

804
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.200
So then this next exercise this is

805
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.200
where I'm going to walk you through this really slowly because I

806
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.500
want to I want you to kind of experience.

807
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.500
with a with a

808
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.900
with the kind of a vignette here with a

809
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.800
statement that I hope one. I

810
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.400
don't want it to cause a fight but I

811
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.700
want you to be able to kind of get an experience. So this is what we typically do.

812
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.400
This is how I would typically respond if

813
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.300
you were to say something like that for me, this is how it typically respond.

814
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.400
So I want you to be able to have this experience.

815
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.700
and then

816
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.400
With each other kind of a normal what you might see as a

817
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.700
normal experience and then I want you to have an experience over

818
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.800
here of showing up for each

819
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.000
other.

820
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.200
And a vulnerable way.

821
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.800
Right. So this was a little challenging for

822
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.100
me for sure to try to put this together because I do want

823
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.100
you to get both sides mainly because I want you to

824
00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.700
experience this so I'm gonna start with

825
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.400
the ladies

826
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.600
And what I have you kind of choose a statement here, you're too

827
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.200
focused on the kids activities, you're gone every weekend to this

828
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.400
tournament or that whatever it may be or you can do the

829
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.200
other one. All you want to do is play those stupid video games. You're never around when

830
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.200
I need you just pick one of those that you think's gonna win you in Academy

831
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.100
Award and and try to and try to

832
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.200
say that right. This may be long outside of your your kids

833
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.500
may be long gone or whatever. You may never have

834
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.300
played a video game in your life. I don't know just kind

835
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.100
of pick a pick a statement that you think

836
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.100
that you can kind of role play and I get it's always challenging to do that.

837
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.000
But I want you to do that and then

838
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.600
Then husbands, I want you to be able to say.

839
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.300
That can what what's the typical response for you?

840
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.600
What might you say or do? Okay, so so ladies

841
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.900
I want you to

842
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.700
make this statement.

843
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.100
to them

844
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.600
and then as soon as it gets quiet, then I'm gonna ask the

845
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.300
guys to respond to that. Okay, so take

846
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.000
however long it takes you to say that statement to each other

847
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:04.800
and do that.

848
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.500
Okay, you got that got no

849
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.600
and I get it. Yes his little challenging even little silly

850
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:20.700
but

851
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.900
Now now guys, I'm wondering how you

852
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.000
would typically respond to something

853
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.200
like that. Like how does it make

854
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.200
you what does the feeling that's coming up?

855
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:33.100
right

856
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.400
And if you're by yourself, imagine that being told

857
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.100
you and how would that feeling come up for you?

858
00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.100
You have that.

859
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.300
How would you tell your spouse how you would typically respond or you

860
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.900
may have to ask them? How would I typically respond if you don't know how would

861
00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.500
you typically respond?

862
00:44:59.200 --> 00:44:59.400
Okay.

863
00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.400
So now you have your kind of this your typical response.

864
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.000
Now man, I want you to have an opportunity.

865
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.000
To be able to show up emotionally.

866
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.300
For your for her by validating what you're hearing from her.

867
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.400
So let me give you an example, but I'm not going to use one of these. I want to use a different example

868
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.700
so that you don't steal anything. I say.

869
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.600
So ladies, let's say you say to your husband. You're spending

870
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.000
too much money on golf clubs.

871
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.400
Not that that's personal or anything, right? Not

872
00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.200
that not that that's for or on

873
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.900
your anything golf related for me. You're spending

874
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.500
too much money.

875
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.900
husband you respond with

876
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.300
because you know, I'm feeling this right I'm feeling

877
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.200
this inside this. Oh, I've done something wrong. I'm not

878
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.900
a good husband. I'm a failure. I've made

879
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.300
a mistake. I've heard her feelings something all

880
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.700
this is going on for me, right? It's happening on the inside.

881
00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.500
But I feel this Force to defend myself. That's

882
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.500
the cycle. And so I move toward her

883
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.400
and I say help me understand what you're feeling.

884
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.400
When you say that.

885
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.600
Right. So ladies

886
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.500
Say this your statement again.

887
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.800
To them whatever it was that you said and then

888
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.600
husbands I want you to be able to ask.

889
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.700
Help me understand how you're feeling when you

890
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.800
say that. Okay? Okay do that.

891
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:50.500
Okay.

892
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.800
It's you said the same statement.

893
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.500
Or you said the first statement and then it's a

894
00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.700
here's how we typically respond for that. I would ignore that.

895
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.400
Or I would go do something else or I would

896
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.600
get angry and I would get defensive. That's my typical response to

897
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.400
you which would kind of throw us

898
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:09.900
into the cycle.

899
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.900
And then being able to understand how you're feeling in that moment defensive

900
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.800
attack.

901
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.300
Inadequate, whatever it may be for you feeling that.

902
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.700
Second one is okay. You say the same statement, but now you're kind

903
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.900
of pushing against that typical response right that

904
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.400
Force that's saying that's the

905
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.100
enemy saying remember that feeling is coming

906
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.300
up now, but you kind of you're stepping outside of this

907
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:41.200
cycle and you're saying help me understand what's happening

908
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.500
for you.

909
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.800
Right now, right what is going on for you?

910
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.100
Okay, so in in the scenario that I said.

911
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.100
She says to me, I'm worried. I was like, you

912
00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.900
know help me understand how you feel. When you tell me that I'm spending too much money.

913
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.200
On golf stuff. I'm worried about the

914
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.400
finances because I'm not making my quote as

915
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:02.800
it work.

916
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.100
context

917
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.600
that's happening for her in showing up

918
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.000
for her.

919
00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.800
I would say something like it makes sense to me that you're worried

920
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.900
because of your situation at work.

921
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.500
Right because what I didn't get before was the worry the

922
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.900
core emotion, I didn't get that.

923
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.300
I got criticism. You're spending too much money at

924
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.800
work. Right? Does that make sense?

925
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.200
Okay.

926
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:29.700
so

927
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.400
Men, you kind of heard that core

928
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:33.800
emotion.

929
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.100
You and and you tell her that you

930
00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.200
understand it that makes sense to you. Right? Does it

931
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.000
make sense to you that she felt the way

932
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.100
she felt I'm assuming you shared that she shared

933
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:50.000
with you that core emotion. Does that make sense to you? If it

934
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.300
if it makes sense to you tell her?

935
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:53.900
Can you tell her?

936
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.200
How that feeling whatever scenario you

937
00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:57.500
chose.

938
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.600
That it makes sense to you.

939
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.500
That's a big piece. Can you do that real quick?

940
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.900
Make sense to me that you're feeling that way.

941
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.500
having that

942
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.400
experience of saying it makes sense

943
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:18.700
to me.

944
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.100
Now that's you showing up for them.

945
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:23.800
emotionally

946
00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.700
It's vulnerably you are not defending

947
00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:28.900
it.

948
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.800
You're saying I can see how when I spend that

949
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.200
money. That scares you.

950
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.300
That makes sense to me that you would feel worried about

951
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.000
that. Okay. All right. Now I'm going to

952
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.000
do the same thing with the guys.

953
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.800
Gonna just reverse roles guys. Here's two more scenarios for

954
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.400
you. You're always too late at the office. You

955
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.300
always stay too late at the office. I'm the one here taking care of everything.

956
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.400
Or all you do is criticize and complained you you ever

957
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.700
think that maybe you're not perfect either.

958
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.900
So I want you to pick one of those guys.

959
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.500
I want you to share that.

960
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.100
with her

961
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.700
Okay, pick one of those do that now.

962
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.000
Okay, good. You said that Now ladies?

963
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.700
Pay attention how you're feeling with that?

964
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.200
And tell him this is how this is what

965
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:34.100
happens to me. This is my this would be my typical response to

966
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.200
something along that line telling me whether this

967
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.400
is defensiveness or whatever is coming up.

968
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.800
Just hurt or whatever from that attack. And then how

969
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.100
would you typically respond tell him how you would kind of

970
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.200
typically respond to that?

971
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.400
Okay, so now ladies I want you to have an opportunity to

972
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.900
show up.

973
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.100
for him

974
00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.200
by validating what he's saying? So for example

975
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.600
husbands, you say you never want to have sex.

976
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.500
Because I know that's never come up in your relationship before

977
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.300
so it's a perfectly rare example wife you

978
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.600
respond with help me understand.

979
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.200
How how you feel when you say that? So whatever statement you

980
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:27.900
said guys?

981
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.900
Say ask her how she feels.

982
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.000
when or

983
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.200
Sorry, you know what? I mean?

984
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.400
Ladies asking him how he's feeling when he

985
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.800
says that to you.

986
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.600
Only share guys only share that core emotion that

987
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:46.900
comes up.

988
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.700
okay, so in my scenario is

989
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.000
I say I feel unwanted.

990
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.600
When we're not having sex and I worry I'm not good enough for you.

991
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.600
And showing up for them.

992
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.600
You would say something like I can understand that you feel unwanted when

993
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.800
we're not having sex and that you would worry that you're

994
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.600
not good enough for me.

995
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.500
That makes sense to me. So ladies, you've heard this core

996
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.300
motion from him. He shared this with you. This is what's coming

997
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:31.600
up for him.

998
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.000
You tell him that you understand it that it makes sense to you.

999
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.300
Right. Does that make sense to you using your scenario? Tell him?

1000
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.100
That what you heard that that it makes

1001
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:41.600
sense to you.

1002
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.300
So a lot of times when we're trying to

1003
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.700
you know, I hear a lot of couples and and and the office.

1004
00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.100
Oh, yes.

1005
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.900
So you say help me understand?

1006
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.500
Right three words. It'll save your life.

1007
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.000
Help me understand. I want it to make

1008
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.300
sense, right the idea is if it

1009
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.300
doesn't make sense to you say that doesn't make sense,

1010
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.300
but I really want to understand it.

1011
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.600
Move toward him with this. I don't

1012
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.400
know right because there's a guy said here. Sometimes I can't label

1013
00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.100
that's it, or I'm trying to explain it. And I don't know that it's coming out,

1014
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:31.800
right?

1015
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.400
I've been there.

1016
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.300
And to be able to say listen, I don't understand

1017
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.100
that. I really want to can you help me understand? Can you

1018
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.200
help me make sense of this?

1019
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.300
Because a lot if we find the right context

1020
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.100
Then we can we can make sense of it.

1021
00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.700
Right. Everything makes sense in context.

1022
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.100
Right. I look back at how often use the example of

1023
00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:58.700
9/11.

1024
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.100
We all look at that and go when what a vicious attack.

1025
00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.500
If you can make sense of it, I'm not

1026
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.700
saying that we have to agree with what's happening in our

1027
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.200
relationship. But if you can make sense of it,

1028
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.600
right that moves you toward understanding I can

1029
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.900
make sense of that in context.

1030
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.600
in context of 2100 years

1031
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.600
Right of Muslims feeling that way I can see that I can

1032
00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.100
see what would happen. It doesn't I don't have to agree with

1033
00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.900
it. I don't have to like it. I hate it, but

1034
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.400
I understand it. This is where we relationship. Right?

1035
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.400
And the reality is I mean look at Democrats

1036
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.600
and Republicans for crying out loud. It's the same cycle on

1037
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.600
a larger scale.

1038
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.600
Right, they're both trying to do something, right? It

1039
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.800
just doesn't look like it from the other side.

1040
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.300
So this reason I think a marriage and family therapist like Jeff back

1041
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.100
there or whatever would make a really good president.

1042
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.800
So, okay.

1043
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.400
So how does it feel to be validated? How does

1044
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.400
it feel to to be to get

1045
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.200
gotten or to feel felt?

1046
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.000
How's it feel?

1047
00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.800
Feels relieving, right? It feels safe. It

1048
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.700
feels secure. I got somebody on my team.

1049
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.300
I got somebody who gets me.

1050
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.500
Somebody who understands me.

1051
00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.700
Understanding is crucial.

1052
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.100
And I want to say at this point some people are going to

1053
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.100
kind of worry. Well, we have this problem. How do we solve that? Here's the

1054
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.900
deal. You are the expert in your problem, not me.

1055
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.000
What keeps you from solving that problem is understanding what's

1056
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.900
happening for each other?

1057
00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.400
I have a couple that I've worked I've been working with them for

1058
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400
probably a year now.

1059
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.400
And they've been married about

1060
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.300
12 13 years or so, and he

1061
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.400
wanted another child.

1062
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.700
Because they're probably 14 years because they're

1063
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.500
they're daughter is about 12

1064
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.800
years old.

1065
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.500
And he's wanting another child.

1066
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.400
And she already has two she has one from a previous relationship. And

1067
00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.900
and so she's I don't want anymore children.

1068
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.600
And so as I've been working with them and they come because

1069
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.300
then they'll argue about this and he's wanting another child. What happens

1070
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.500
for him? Is he throws himself into the soccer

1071
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.200
and being a great soccer dad and

1072
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.100
being a great soccer coach because he's good at that. He's good

1073
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.400
at connecting with his daughter and

1074
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.600
being a good coach. He's adequate he's good enough for

1075
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:33.800
her.

1076
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.300
Right, so he throws himself into that.

1077
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.600
Well, how do you think the wife feels?

1078
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.100
lonely

1079
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.900
unwanted unimportant

1080
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.300
all of those. Yes.

1081
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.700
So do you think she wants to have another child?

1082
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.400
No, absolutely not because what will that

1083
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.800
do in her mind that just says that'll give him all these

1084
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.300
many more years of being without me. I don't want to live that

1085
00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:59.500
many more years being lonely.

1086
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.700
And so how's it feel being him?

1087
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.900
Criticized never be good enough all of

1088
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.300
those things because out of her loneliness.

1089
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:16.000
Kind of like April in the scenario out of her loneliness. She's critical.

1090
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.200
You never want to spend time with me. You're always throwing yourself into the

1091
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:19.400
kids.

1092
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.000
You're going to this Tournament of that every other weekend.

1093
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.500
Whatever, right so he feels good. So he

1094
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.300
wants another child so he can have something that he's good at in his

1095
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.600
mind. He's not a good husband. He's an inadequate.

1096
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.100
Husband, he's a failure as a husband. So he wants another kid because he's good at

1097
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:35.300
that.

1098
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.400
Something that makes him feel good. So as we've been doing this work for

1099
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:39.500
them.

1100
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.500
They've been recognizing and they've been able to show up. It makes

1101
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.200
sense to her. She says it makes sense to me that you

1102
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.400
would want another child because you don't feel good enough to

1103
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.400
me. You feel like you can never do anything good enough for me

1104
00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.600
in my eyes or you know

1105
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.400
And he's like it makes sense to me that you would

1106
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.400
not want to have another child because you already feel lonely

1107
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.200
without me.

1108
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.100
Why would you want to spend all of these years?

1109
00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.500
All 18 more years lonely.

1110
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.100
That makes sense.

1111
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.700
Does that make sense to you how that's working, you know

1112
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:16.400
where they are now.

1113
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:20.300
Not pregnant not pregnant, you know where they

1114
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:20.400
are now.

1115
00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:21.400
She's like

1116
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.300
I'd love to have another child with you.

1117
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:26.500
And he said to her.

1118
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:29.700
I have you.

1119
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.500
I have that kind of what Jeff was saying about the lady putting her

1120
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.000
ring on this is what happens.

1121
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.300
He wanted another child to protect him. She doesn't want another

1122
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.400
child to protect her now. She wants a child to protect him

1123
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.200
and he doesn't want a child to protect her. Does that make sense?

1124
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.500
That's what the cycle is doing to us.

1125
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.000
That's what it's doing to us. That's how it's destroying us.

1126
00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.000
So I completely got off. This is again why I have to have paper in front of me.

1127
00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.400
I want you to be able to hear the difference in the responses. Our first response

1128
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.200
our typical response. Is this kind of

1129
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.500
staying away from each other?

1130
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.500
Taking a defensive stance.

1131
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.100
Focusing on protecting ourselves. And the second

1132
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.300
is you being focused on the other you being all about her

1133
00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.000
you're being all about him and their feelings.

1134
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.400
The first one takes you headlong into the cycle

1135
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.800
the second one allows you to step outside of

1136
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.000
it.

1137
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:32.300
And the second one has the ability to soften

1138
00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.700
the other.

1139
00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.000
to cough

1140
00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.600
It softens when I have a teammate when

1141
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.700
I have somebody who gets me man.

1142
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.400
If somebody who shows me that I'm loved and shows me that I'm important.

1143
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.100
I can do anything.

1144
00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.100
right 12 disciples Matthew 28

1145
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.300
Right, they'll die for him because he's with them.

1146
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.400
So I hope you're seeing this like,

1147
00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.200
okay. Sorry, I got one more side. I didn't show you this one.

1148
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.600
It's an important point.

1149
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.700
The second one here is a very challenging position.

1150
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.400
We'll say that before I get to this next slide second

1151
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.100
one. Here's an incredibly different position because

1152
01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.500
it takes you being vulnerable to be

1153
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.600
emotionally present.

1154
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:24.100
All the while fighting off that sense of being attacked. That's why

1155
01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.600
it's vulnerable. It's vulnerable to share. Yes. It's also vulnerable

1156
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.400
to get it.

1157
01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.400
To understand it I often liken it to confessing to a

1158
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.100
crime that you didn't commit.

1159
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.300
Or at least that you didn't intend to commit.

1160
01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.400
Saying I get it. It makes sense to me.

1161
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.200
So and being that many of you have kind of lived this cycle already

1162
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.300
to the live this point

1163
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.300
to this point in your life with without any knowledge of

1164
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:48.800
the cycle.

1165
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.100
The outcome has made it necessary for you to avoid that's why I

1166
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.100
kind of stepping out and moving toward them. You would only do that. If you

1167
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.100
have like this full suit of armor on and all I'm asking you

1168
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.800
is to recognize they're not your enemy.

1169
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.500
Move toward them and understand what's happening

1170
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.500
Moana moving toward to kah,

1171
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.600
you're not the enemy.

1172
01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.300
I'm not going to be afraid of your anger anymore.

1173
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.400
I'm not afraid of your distance anymore. It

1174
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.200
makes sense to me.

1175
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.200
So so at an important point for you

1176
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.500
to understand is this go to this next slide there. I

1177
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:24.800
think we

1178
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.200
have that

1179
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.300
if you're the angry or aggressive one.

1180
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.600
You must understand the damage your anger has

1181
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.000
done.

1182
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.400
To your spouse and how it's kept them from coming towards you

1183
01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.500
to offer what you need.

1184
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.100
I guess we don't have.

1185
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.200
The maybe that one's not up there. Maybe I I may

1186
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.300
have I may have added that and forgot to

1187
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.500
tell you my fault.

1188
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.400
So I'll say it again. If you're the angry one or you're the aggressive

1189
01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.400
one. You must understand the damage your anger has

1190
01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.900
done to your spouse.

1191
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:01.700
Yes.

1192
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.200
Yeah, this is where it's it's first make sense of

1193
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.200
it. It understand Hey listen,

1194
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.500
I I don't know what's happened. It's hard for me to understand and at

1195
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.100
some point listen it may be this is where I

1196
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:28.500
may need some if I'm if we're in a place and I just don't understand it

1197
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.400
is where I mean go seek some help. I I really

1198
01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.100
need to understand it. The good news is putting ourselves

1199
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.100
in a position in a vulnerable place to try to

1200
01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:37.800
seek to understand.

1201
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.300
One is calming for us and calming for them. And then

1202
01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.400
when we're calm, we're more likely to be able to verbalize something

1203
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.700
even more deep for

1204
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.700
us because it could be something it it what

1205
01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.500
we refer to as a block. There is

1206
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.200
something there's this block for me to be able to say to you what I

1207
01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.400
want you to get.

1208
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.300
Because it's really vulnerable too vulnerable for

1209
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.100
me to share with you.

1210
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.300
So and we can talk about later and I'll even give you my email if you want to email me

1211
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.300
and then we can kind of do that back and forth to try to help a little bit because that

1212
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.200
is challenging. It's just an outcome of the cycle that

1213
01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.500
creates a place where I don't understand what you're doing.

1214
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.900
So we can kind of talk about that a little bit more.

1215
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.400
But we really must understand the damage that

1216
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.400
we've done to our spouse.

1217
01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.700
And how it's kept them from coming toward toward a

1218
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.300
toward us or toward you to offer what

1219
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.100
you need. So I totally understand that anger or

1220
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.400
the distance or whatever is is an attempt

1221
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.200
to be heard. What you need to understand is divisive. It's

1222
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.800
not connecting.

1223
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.400
If this is true for you, and you're recognizing that

1224
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.300
you're the angry one, I'm praying you'll tell

1225
01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:52.600
your spouse that you get it that how scary your

1226
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.300
anger must be for them. Right in order to try

1227
01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.100
to help them feel safer with you and tell them that you

1228
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.200
want them to know what's really happening for you.

1229
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200
So I hope you're seeing.

1230
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.100
The cycle here as your your enemy.

1231
01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.700
It really does seek to turn us.

1232
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.200
from lovers into enemies

1233
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.400
And so this this kind of brings me back full circle.

1234
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.800
This brings us all full circle.

1235
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.100
Back to the Garden where the enemy first showed up

1236
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.000
in our marriage.

1237
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.800
if you remember back to Genesis 3, right we talked about Genesis 2:18

1238
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.800
to 28 if you remember back to Genesis 3

1239
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.200
After listen, after listening to the enemy and then

1240
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.000
sinning disobeying and sinning.

1241
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.100
God came to them.

1242
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.600
And they were hiding remember.

1243
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.400
And he says I heard you.

1244
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.900
He said where are you who he knows where they are, right, of course.

1245
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.900
He says I was I was hiding.

1246
01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.400
Because I was naked and I was afraid and that's why who

1247
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.200
told you that you were naked right? Remember how defensive Adam

1248
01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.000
became in that moment.

1249
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.200
When God when I got asked where they were who told you you were

1250
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.300
naked how defensive when God asked him and he told me he was naked.

1251
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.500
Adam said that woman you gave to

1252
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.400
be with me.

1253
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.700
That woman you gave me to be with me. She gave

1254
01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.300
it to me and I ate.

1255
01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.600
This was the beginning of conflict.

1256
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.000
In the garden and I think Satan learned in that moment.

1257
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.300
A very powerful tool. This is how he can get in

1258
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:29.600
between us.

1259
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.600
This is how he can destroy the connection that we have.

1260
01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.900
if we don't realize

1261
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500
the work he's doing to destroy us.

1262
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.000
We're doomed to stay trapped in it.

1263
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.400
And if we never get out of it.

1264
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.600
we're always going to be fighting each other

1265
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.300
to try to get to it to try to get to this love

1266
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.200
that we once have we're going to try to achieve this love

1267
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.600
that we

1268
01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.800
started off with so many years ago.

1269
01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.300
Well forever be fighting for the incredible marriage.

1270
01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.400
that we desire

1271
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:10.100
We're always going to be fighting for that the last thing love that

1272
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.900
we hope to share.

1273
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.800
the warm and intimate peaceful

1274
01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.300
Connecting love that we were supposed to have. This is

1275
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.800
what the enemy is trying to destroy us from it's this

1276
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.700
warm and peaceful.

1277
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.300
Intimate love that. God gave us to enjoy.

1278
01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.800
until death to his part

1279
01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.100
not until this cycle tears us

1280
01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.100
apart. So this kind of love.

1281
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.500
Is what I want you I want to show you this video.

1282
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.200
And I'm not going to set it up for you, and I'm not going to come back up after

1283
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:43.700
it's over.

1284
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.200
My Hope Is that it's it gets

1285
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.800
My hope is that it inspires you.

1286
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.200
My hope is that it helps you see this is

1287
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.000
the kind of love.

1288
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.500
That I want for you and this is the kind of love that God

1289
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.100
wants for you.

1290
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.600
But this is the kind of love that the enemy wants to destroy.

1291
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:03.700
Okay.

1292
01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.200
I want to

1293
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.600
fall in love at 85.

1294
01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:13.300
Go on shuffleboard dates and dance to Hip

1295
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.200
Hop from 95.

1296
01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.400
We'd Rock matching tracksuits and rope gold

1297
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.000
chains.

1298
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.100
We'd look like Run DMC but in their old age.

1299
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.800
We'd take aerobics classes and whereby focal

1300
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.700
glasses and eat at IHOP and hold hands

1301
01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.300
at Sunday masses and when it comes to the bedroom.

1302
01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.500
Well, nothing much would happen the bedroom because we're 85.

1303
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.400
but we would still be down to take a walk or take a driver sit

1304
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.900
and talk or have a drink watch the passage by ask each

1305
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.300
other why and how and who and where and

1306
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.300
when and then we'd laugh and cry again about the people we

1307
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.000
I would touch her withered skin.

1308
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.800
And comment on how thin it is to keep in something infinite.

1309
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.100
And she would smile sweet and blush and tell me that I think

1310
01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:58.700
too much.

1311
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.900
She's right. I think too much.

1312
01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:02.800
It's always been a problem.

1313
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.300
But then again, that's how I made my green like the Goblin.

1314
01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.800
When I was in my twenties, I was eating Top Ramen

1315
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.500
counting up my pennies saving up to go food shopping,

1316
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500
but now I'm 85.

1317
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.600
And somehow I feel more alive.

1318
01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.300
I turn my hearing aid up and bumped Jurassic 5.

1319
01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.600
And when it comes to the bedroom.

1320
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:25.600
well, hopefully

1321
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.700
every once in a while.

1322
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.200
She lets me knock her boots into the floor patterns of

1323
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.400
our bedposts then hold her head close like death

1324
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.500
isn't chasing us.

1325
01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.800
Planning on erasing us and replacing us with better

1326
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.200
versions of us reshaping us

1327
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.800
remaking us then recreating us with new identities

1328
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.400
so we can make new memories hush little

1329
01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.300
baby learn to walk and talk and think and

1330
01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.600
lie and feel and fight and love and die and

1331
01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.200
never get the answers why she tips to

1332
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.200
join of grass and wheatgrass and we get high.

1333
01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:02.100
Her hair is silver as the moon in Miami

1334
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:02.600
sky.

1335
01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.400
We still pop Hills, but it's not the Xanax

1336
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:06.600
anymore.

1337
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.500
Whenever we can't sleep we listen to the ocean floor.

1338
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.500
She got a sound of the CCD for me from the Brookstone store and

1339
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.000
ever since I've been snoring like a

1340
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.700
Like a really good metaphor for snoring. Sorry I

1341
01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.800
go blank sometimes.

1342
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.900
What I'm 85.

1343
01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.300
I'm not complaining. I'm just happy that I'm still alive and happy

1344
01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.300
that I have my better half by my side

1345
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.500
Super Flash. He doesn't look a day over 65.

1346
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.400
When I first saw I was totally in

1347
01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:38.900
awe.

1348
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.400
She was classical so I was like Yo Yo

1349
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:42.500
Ma.

1350
01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.900
And that was all it took.

1351
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.400
A single look and I was shook I fell for

1352
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.600
like some loose shingles from our Spanish roof.

1353
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.300
And I'm a lover till she loses every last root and has

1354
01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.800
to glue Dentures to her gums to chew solid food.

1355
01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:57.900
Oh.

1356
01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.900
Now that's real love, dude.

1357
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.000
That's some push comes to shove love.

1358
01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.400
Not when it's convenient, love.

1359
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.200
hospital bed love

1360
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.400
Feed her ice chips love.

1361
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.100
Never leave the room.

1362
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.500
sleeping in the chair

1363
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.200
pray to up above love.

1364
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.100
Have to pull the plug.

1365
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.100
Miss her in my bones love.

1366
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.500
Everything about her love die within

1367
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.500
a month love can't live without her love.

1368
01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:38.400
love

1369
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.600
The only reason that we are a lie.

1370
01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.800
And none of us should have to wait until 85.
