1
00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:17.085
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:27.845
Well, grace and peace to you church,

7
00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:29.005
it's great to see you.

8
00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.445
As always. If you're new to our church, uh,

9
00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.085
we are thankful you'd be here.

10
00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:35.325
We'd love to meet you, uh, just to let us know

11
00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:39.685
how we can serve you as well as uh, include you

12
00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:41.165
and connect you as best we can here.

13
00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.085
Also, if you've been here at our church

14
00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:45.205
for 60 years, we love you too.

15
00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.365
We're grateful that you're here as well.

16
00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:51.365
Now, it may be hard to think about, uh, it is

17
00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:53.525
for me at times, but,

18
00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:57.085
but when was the last time you were truly overwhelmed?

19
00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:01.605
And I'm not saying like that day that you were busy,

20
00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:07.625
but like where you were truly overwhelmed, where

21
00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.465
like you, you feel in over your head.

22
00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:15.305
There's no way out where a situation

23
00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:16.665
feels pretty hopeless.

24
00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:21.745
Maybe you've been there before.

25
00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:26.065
I have, and I know many of you have.

26
00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:29.705
It's pretty disorienting, isn't it?

27
00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:34.185
It feels like you just don't even know which way is up

28
00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:35.865
and where to go.

29
00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.785
But here's one of the, here's one

30
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.945
of the most painful parts about those times though.

31
00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:46.065
Those kind of emotions

32
00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:48.225
and those kind of feelings are often the ones

33
00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:50.385
that we hide the most at church,

34
00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:52.395
Right?

35
00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:54.585
Like we, we walk in

36
00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:56.745
and we say, well, everything's all together.

37
00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:58.465
I gotta put on the face, I gotta make sure

38
00:01:58.465 --> 00:01:59.785
everybody thinks everything's okay.

39
00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:05.625
But that's why I love the Psalms so much

40
00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:09.185
Because Our tendency is to stuff those things

41
00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:10.385
and put on a brave face.

42
00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:15.305
But the Psalms are honest and raw.

43
00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:22.825
They give us permission to pour out our true feelings

44
00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:26.465
to the Lord even then to others

45
00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:30.345
because we've seen examples of how it's been done.

46
00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:37.825
In fact, today we'll see one of the people

47
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:42.065
that we portray as like a hero, strong guy in the faith,

48
00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:46.905
somebody who we look at as a tough guy.

49
00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:53.985
We'll see him show his vulnerable side in this psalm today.

50
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.145
And we're gonna just pick up the next Psalm in order

51
00:02:56.205 --> 00:02:58.065
as we've done Psalm 69.

52
00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:01.485
And what we're gonna see King David do today is he's gonna

53
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:04.845
show us behind the curtain of a life

54
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.285
that's really hard at the time

55
00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:13.685
and struggle, pain, what it feels like

56
00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:16.485
to be overwhelmed with grief, to question God,

57
00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:18.965
to even feel like God's abandoned you.

58
00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:24.565
We'll see it yet my prayer at the same time

59
00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:29.245
is that we also see the God that he points

60
00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:30.965
to in the middle of it.

61
00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:37.285
So God, we do ask you for that, for you to help us see that

62
00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:44.165
as we process and think about true feelings in life

63
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:45.725
and what that means.

64
00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:47.725
I ask you, Lord, to teach us today,

65
00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:49.445
it's gotta be your spirit teaching us,

66
00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:52.685
your spirit leading us, opening our hearts

67
00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:57.205
and our eyes to understand and see what you want us to know.

68
00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:00.245
It's gotta be your work. God do this

69
00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:03.925
and I pray you would awaken things in us today

70
00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:07.885
that maybe we've stuffed, hidden denied

71
00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:13.005
and you would lead us to you

72
00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:15.165
and heal us today.

73
00:04:15.225 --> 00:04:18.645
God, in Jesus' name. Amen.

74
00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.285
So if you're not there already, if you would turn

75
00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:24.325
with me in God's word to Psalm 69,

76
00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:30.405
about in the middle you find the Psalm, Psalms 69.

77
00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:35.525
Now there's a principle of biblical interpretation we

78
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:36.645
call typology.

79
00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:40.685
Uh, you'll see the word how it's spelled typology.

80
00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:45.845
Now it's related to prophecy that predicts the future,

81
00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:48.325
which you see that in the Old Testament

82
00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:49.525
a lot, even in the New Testament.

83
00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:53.365
But it's unique in that it involves, uh,

84
00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:56.045
events or persons

85
00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:59.845
or even phrases that in a way

86
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:04.845
in the Old Testament prefigured events around Christ.

87
00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:08.925
So lemme give you an example maybe help you understand.

88
00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.525
So Jonah in the Old Testament, he spent three days

89
00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:14.525
in the belly of the fish

90
00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:18.005
and then when the fish spit him out on the shore

91
00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:19.045
where he was supposed to go,

92
00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:22.325
in a sense he was resurrected from the dead.

93
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:26.525
You might say, well, Jesus picks that same language up

94
00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:30.325
and says, that's kind of like what happened when I was dead

95
00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:33.285
and then raised on the third day, right?

96
00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:37.405
So Jonah is a type of Christ in that sense.

97
00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:40.365
It's even explicit in Romans five 14,

98
00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.405
the Apostle Paul calls Adam the first

99
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:43.605
man in the garden, right?

100
00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:48.565
A type of the one who was to come Christ.

101
00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:54.125
So aspects of Adam's life aligned with Jesus's life

102
00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:55.525
to teach us something.

103
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:57.845
So we look at Adam, we can study some things

104
00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:01.565
and it teaches us one of the most common types

105
00:06:02.305 --> 00:06:04.525
of Christ, some of the Old Testament.

106
00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:07.045
Prefiguring Christ is King David

107
00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:10.405
and you know King David, the boy with the sling,

108
00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:14.125
the greatest king that Israel ever knew, the one

109
00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.445
who wrote many of the psalms that we are studying

110
00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:18.965
through over these decades in this book, right?

111
00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:22.565
In fact, this fall we're gonna continue the study

112
00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:23.685
of David in a different way.

113
00:06:23.685 --> 00:06:24.925
We're gonna look at his kingship

114
00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:27.365
and Saul's kingship in the book

115
00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:29.205
of one Samuel start that in August.

116
00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:30.965
So look ahead towards those things.

117
00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:34.605
But what we're gonna see today in Psalm 69 is this Psalm

118
00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:40.365
presents David's experience as, as the typical servant

119
00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:43.045
who's trying to follow the Lord

120
00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:48.325
that he's in a sense the typical servant you might say,

121
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.405
where he's foreshadowing something

122
00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:52.725
to come in Christ who's the greater king?

123
00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.685
That this king is great, the greatest Israel ever knew,

124
00:06:55.905 --> 00:06:58.085
but he's, he's still less than

125
00:06:58.105 --> 00:07:00.405
and he's foreshadowing something to come

126
00:07:00.945 --> 00:07:03.005
in the greatest king Jesus.

127
00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:06.285
So we're gonna see a lot of things about what it means

128
00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:08.925
to be typical, the type here.

129
00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:10.885
But first we're gonna look behind the curtain

130
00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:15.005
of David's life, just verses one through 12 here.

131
00:07:15.105 --> 00:07:19.365
See the struggle again, he's writing this

132
00:07:19.365 --> 00:07:21.365
to the choir master according to lilies,

133
00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:22.885
which is probably some melody line

134
00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:24.285
that they were using at the time.

135
00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:28.205
David wrote this. It says, save me, oh God,

136
00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.485
for the waters have come up to my neck.

137
00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:35.085
I sink in deep mire where there is no foothold.

138
00:07:35.515 --> 00:07:38.885
I've come into deep waters, the flood sweeps over me.

139
00:07:39.985 --> 00:07:41.885
I'm weary with my crying out.

140
00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:44.925
My throat is parched, my eyes grow, dim

141
00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:46.485
with waiting for my God.

142
00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:50.925
More in number than the hairs of my head are those

143
00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:52.605
who hate me without cause.

144
00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.605
Mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me

145
00:07:56.605 --> 00:07:59.965
with lies what I did not steal.

146
00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:01.085
Must I now restore?

147
00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:03.485
Oh God, you know my flia,

148
00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:05.285
the wrongs I've done are not hidden from you.

149
00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:09.365
Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me,

150
00:08:10.145 --> 00:08:11.285
oh Lord, God of hosts.

151
00:08:11.945 --> 00:08:13.645
Let not those who seek you be brought

152
00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:14.685
to dishonor through me.

153
00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:17.565
Oh God of Israel. For it is for your sake

154
00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:18.845
that I have born reproach.

155
00:08:19.035 --> 00:08:20.885
That dishonor has covered my face.

156
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.405
I've become a stranger to my brothers, an alien

157
00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:27.725
to my mother's sons for zeal,

158
00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:29.605
for your house has consumed me.

159
00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:31.925
And the reproaches of those

160
00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:34.125
who reproach you have fallen on me.

161
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.845
And when I wept and humbled my soul with fasting,

162
00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:39.205
it became my reproach.

163
00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:43.005
When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a by word

164
00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:44.765
to them, meaning they made fun of me for it.

165
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.405
I am the talk of those who sit in the gate

166
00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:50.925
and the drunkards make songs about me.

167
00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:58.245
That's the struggle. Now,

168
00:08:58.245 --> 00:09:01.965
when we say David is the typical servant, I mean again,

169
00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:05.765
he can be seen as a type of Christ looking forward

170
00:09:05.905 --> 00:09:08.325
to something, but also as the typical servant,

171
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.845
we could see David as a representation of all servants

172
00:09:12.305 --> 00:09:15.725
of Christ of the Lord in a sense He stands in

173
00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:17.725
for all of us.

174
00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:20.805
And so what I did here is from Psalm 69,

175
00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:25.725
picked out just five truths that typify the experience

176
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:27.365
of a faithful servant of the Lord.

177
00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:33.085
Like what's a servant going to experience, encounter,

178
00:09:34.515 --> 00:09:37.405
feel as they follow the Lord?

179
00:09:37.405 --> 00:09:38.845
There's probably more here you could find,

180
00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:40.845
but I'm just gonna do five today.

181
00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:44.685
So here's the first one. David wrote about it

182
00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:45.805
in verse nine here.

183
00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:50.445
He said He was consumed by zeal for God's house,

184
00:09:53.035 --> 00:09:54.125
servant of the Lord.

185
00:09:54.425 --> 00:09:58.645
He was consumed by zeal for God's house.

186
00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.485
Zeal is a word that means passion, devotion

187
00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:05.125
gonna be zealous for a lot of things.

188
00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:08.005
God is even described as zealous in the book

189
00:10:08.005 --> 00:10:10.245
of Isaiah chapter nine.

190
00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:14.485
He brings about the Messiah's light giving kingship, right?

191
00:10:14.505 --> 00:10:16.965
The the typical Christmas passage child is

192
00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:18.085
given, son is given, right?

193
00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:22.085
Like that's what he's doing is he's zealously bringing about

194
00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:24.085
his reign, his rule.

195
00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:27.445
So zeal can be a good thing.

196
00:10:28.165 --> 00:10:29.485
Zeal can show that we're not lazy.

197
00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:36.165
But did you see David was mourning and crying

198
00:10:36.425 --> 00:10:41.045
and fasting because of his zeal for God's house.

199
00:10:41.425 --> 00:10:43.685
But what it led to was he was getting persecuted for it.

200
00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.905
People were criticizing him, were coming after him

201
00:10:48.905 --> 00:10:50.585
because he was doing that.

202
00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:52.345
I love, I found this quote from Spurgeon.

203
00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:56.785
He said, zeal for God is so little understood

204
00:10:56.885 --> 00:11:01.505
by men of the world that it always draws down opposition

205
00:11:02.135 --> 00:11:04.305
upon those who are filled with zeal.

206
00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:07.445
They are sure to be check this out.

207
00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:10.205
They're sure to be accused of sinister motives

208
00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:15.845
or of hypocrisy or of being out of their senses.

209
00:11:19.035 --> 00:11:21.205
Like we look at some people like man, they are radical

210
00:11:21.425 --> 00:11:25.565
for Jesus and we kind of think they're a little crazy.

211
00:11:27.415 --> 00:11:30.435
But that's part of it is that zeal can be misunderstood

212
00:11:30.535 --> 00:11:31.715
by people who don't have it.

213
00:11:34.365 --> 00:11:35.915
Which in fact leads to the next point.

214
00:11:35.915 --> 00:11:37.875
David is the typical servant here, right?

215
00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:40.395
And so he's scorned by others for his faith

216
00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:44.275
because of his faith.

217
00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.875
He was being scorned all over those 12 verses I read

218
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:49.915
just a second ago, right?

219
00:11:50.185 --> 00:11:54.605
Innumerable people hated him without cause they were trying

220
00:11:54.865 --> 00:11:55.925
to destroy him.

221
00:11:55.955 --> 00:11:58.965
They were lying about him. They were falsely accusing him.

222
00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:00.645
They were gossiping about him.

223
00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:02.805
Even his family pushed him away

224
00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:06.805
All the way down to verse 12.

225
00:12:06.865 --> 00:12:09.605
He says, the drunkards make songs about me.

226
00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:12.325
If you've ever heard a drunk guy sing, you know

227
00:12:12.325 --> 00:12:13.525
how low David feels, right?

228
00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:18.765
I won't imitate that. I'm not gonna try. Okay,

229
00:12:20.705 --> 00:12:21.705
But That's not even it.

230
00:12:24.185 --> 00:12:28.685
It says in verse 20, reproaches have broken my heart so

231
00:12:28.685 --> 00:12:29.885
that I'm in despair.

232
00:12:30.645 --> 00:12:33.965
I looked for pity, but there was none for comforters.

233
00:12:34.225 --> 00:12:38.605
But I found none like he feels so alone.

234
00:12:39.865 --> 00:12:44.085
In verse 21, they gave me poison for food, for my thirst.

235
00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:46.965
They gave me sour wine to drink.

236
00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:51.925
People even trying to poison him like David is as low

237
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.475
as you can go in this moment.

238
00:12:56.695 --> 00:12:58.195
But don't forget it was all

239
00:12:58.195 --> 00:12:59.395
because he was trying

240
00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:02.395
to serve the Lord that all this came on him.

241
00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.885
It was because he was trying to be faithful.

242
00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:09.565
He was zealous for God's house and he was scorned for it.

243
00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:12.405
People came after him.

244
00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:17.285
Now it's easy to, to kind of

245
00:13:17.955 --> 00:13:21.245
project onto these characters things that weren't true.

246
00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:24.445
We'll see that this fall with Saul

247
00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:27.405
and David that we can see both differently.

248
00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:30.405
But before you think David's perfect,

249
00:13:31.935 --> 00:13:36.445
completely innocent in all of it, look again at verse five,

250
00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:42.525
he said, oh God, you know my folly, my foolishness,

251
00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:46.005
the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.

252
00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:50.325
See, David came humbly to the Lord knowing

253
00:13:51.155 --> 00:13:53.645
that he had actually sinned at some point against God.

254
00:13:54.665 --> 00:13:57.525
He wasn't coming saying, God, I am completely blameless.

255
00:13:58.825 --> 00:14:00.565
Now, he might not have done much of anything

256
00:14:00.755 --> 00:14:04.085
that would've caused what he's feeling to these other people

257
00:14:04.465 --> 00:14:05.645
who were attacking him.

258
00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:07.525
He might not have any guilt there,

259
00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:08.965
but he knew that the God

260
00:14:08.965 --> 00:14:11.325
of the universe could see into his selfish heart.

261
00:14:13.985 --> 00:14:15.925
Now, God, you know, you know my folly.

262
00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:19.285
You know that I'm, I'm wicked still in here.

263
00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:21.205
Even though you've redeemed me, I'm still.

264
00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:27.565
And so what that means, as the typical servant said,

265
00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:29.765
David was disciplined for his sins.

266
00:14:31.435 --> 00:14:35.285
Whether that was true here, like was all of this

267
00:14:36.085 --> 00:14:37.525
directly resulting from his sin?

268
00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:40.645
Probably not. But he knew

269
00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:44.645
because of his sins against God, he was due

270
00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:49.535
and did deserve some discipline, just reality.

271
00:14:51.385 --> 00:14:52.845
So he agreed with the Lord on that,

272
00:14:55.455 --> 00:14:57.445
which is really all that confession is.

273
00:14:57.505 --> 00:15:00.445
Did you know that like when you confess sin,

274
00:15:00.445 --> 00:15:02.805
you're not telling God something he doesn't already know.

275
00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:06.725
You gotta reveal it to him somehow.

276
00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:08.525
Like no, he already knows.

277
00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:11.965
So confession is merely agreeing with God

278
00:15:12.155 --> 00:15:13.445
that you did what you did.

279
00:15:16.025 --> 00:15:17.045
And listen, the fact

280
00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:20.125
that God already knows should grease the

281
00:15:20.215 --> 00:15:21.245
skids of confession.

282
00:15:24.225 --> 00:15:26.525
You shouldn't be afraid of taking it to him

283
00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:29.605
because he already knows it and it's just then on you.

284
00:15:29.905 --> 00:15:32.765
And the burden is lifted as you confess your sins.

285
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.045
And he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins

286
00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:38.445
and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

287
00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:44.045
But what we do know whether, whether David's suffering

288
00:15:44.045 --> 00:15:47.285
or our suffering is due to our own sin, which is true.

289
00:15:47.305 --> 00:15:50.085
It happens, right? Or whether it's just from unjust

290
00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:51.245
attacks from other people.

291
00:15:51.745 --> 00:15:56.325
Either way, Romans A says God works for the good of those

292
00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:57.885
who love him and are called according to his purpose.

293
00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:01.125
That's right. So he's gonna turn even the unjust suffering

294
00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.485
into something for his glory, for our good.

295
00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:08.645
But I want you to see a key to this.

296
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:11.645
Notice something else here.

297
00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:16.805
David also knew where to turn in his struggle.

298
00:16:18.385 --> 00:16:20.995
He's feeling the pressure. He's feeling the abandonment.

299
00:16:21.045 --> 00:16:24.355
Where do I turn when I felt the sting of my sin?

300
00:16:24.475 --> 00:16:28.395
Where did I turn when I felt the attacks from others?

301
00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:31.435
Where did I turn? Look at what David did

302
00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:33.315
as the exemplary servant.

303
00:16:35.775 --> 00:16:38.555
He depended on God for his deliverance.

304
00:16:41.305 --> 00:16:43.635
Typical servant example.

305
00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:47.035
Deliverance was from God alone.

306
00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:51.915
What's the first thing out of his mouth in verse one?

307
00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:55.025
Save me. Oh God.

308
00:16:58.925 --> 00:17:03.145
And then feel again the desperation verses one

309
00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:05.105
through three, save me.

310
00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:07.905
Oh God, for the waters have come up to my neck,

311
00:17:07.905 --> 00:17:09.865
meaning he's about to go under all the way

312
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.665
I sink in deep mire, which is like quicksand.

313
00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:16.945
There is no foothold. I can't get out.

314
00:17:17.065 --> 00:17:20.705
I have come into deep waters. The flood sweeps over me.

315
00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:23.385
He's just like all of that's over the top.

316
00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:25.345
I I'm weary with crying out.

317
00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.825
My throat is parched,

318
00:17:27.365 --> 00:17:29.305
my eyes grow dim, meaning I grow tired.

319
00:17:29.525 --> 00:17:32.825
I'm weak with waiting for my God.

320
00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:35.585
Many of us read that

321
00:17:37.365 --> 00:17:39.705
and maybe even right now you're like, that's

322
00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:40.705
Me.

323
00:17:42.435 --> 00:17:45.825
Where you can recall a time in your life where

324
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.445
feel like you're underwater, like you're just spinning out

325
00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:54.165
of control, just exhausted from the grief of waiting

326
00:17:54.545 --> 00:17:57.005
and waiting and waiting on God.

327
00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:02.845
But again, where did God turn or where did David turn?

328
00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.045
He'd said, save me.

329
00:18:04.045 --> 00:18:08.045
Oh God, save me.

330
00:18:08.995 --> 00:18:10.485
Like if you're drowning

331
00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:13.725
and you know the lifeguard's right there, you're gonna reach

332
00:18:13.785 --> 00:18:14.885
for the lifeguard, right?

333
00:18:16.655 --> 00:18:20.545
Like you know where to turn who can save you.

334
00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:22.945
David knew where to turn,

335
00:18:26.145 --> 00:18:28.285
but people, they were piling on him

336
00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:31.165
and he felt like there was no way out.

337
00:18:31.665 --> 00:18:35.805
I'm drowning. Look at his cry. Look at verse 13.

338
00:18:37.415 --> 00:18:38.685
Start here and we're gonna read

339
00:18:38.705 --> 00:18:41.445
and just listen to his desperate cry here.

340
00:18:45.215 --> 00:18:49.315
But as for me, Like all these people have said all these

341
00:18:49.315 --> 00:18:50.795
things, they're doing all these things for me.

342
00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:54.675
As for me, my prayer is to you, oh Lord,

343
00:18:55.775 --> 00:18:58.355
at an acceptable time, oh God, in the abundance

344
00:18:58.455 --> 00:18:59.835
of your steadfast love,

345
00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.595
answer me in your saving faithfulness.

346
00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:05.955
Deliver me from sinking in the mire, right?

347
00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:07.875
Listen for the language that he repeats,

348
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.635
deliver me from sinking in the mire.

349
00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.675
Let me be delivered from my enemies

350
00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.275
and from the deep waters.

351
00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:17.875
Let not the flood sweep over me or the deep swallow me up

352
00:19:17.975 --> 00:19:20.155
or the pit close its mouth over me.

353
00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:26.095
Answer me, oh Lord, for your steadfast love is good,

354
00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:29.135
according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.

355
00:19:30.325 --> 00:19:32.215
Hide, not your face from your servant.

356
00:19:32.355 --> 00:19:35.575
For I'm in distress, make haste to answer me.

357
00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:38.815
Draw near to my soul. Redeem me.

358
00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:41.895
Ransom me because of my enemies.

359
00:19:43.595 --> 00:19:47.695
See, David never forgot the character of God.

360
00:19:49.235 --> 00:19:52.935
He never forgot that Yahweh that he knew that he loved.

361
00:19:53.035 --> 00:19:57.055
He never forgot him. In fact, he remembered

362
00:19:57.075 --> 00:19:58.175
as the language shows us

363
00:19:58.175 --> 00:20:02.335
what God told Moses all the way back in Exodus 34,

364
00:20:02.915 --> 00:20:06.335
the Lord a God, merciful

365
00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:11.295
and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love

366
00:20:11.515 --> 00:20:14.655
and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands,

367
00:20:14.995 --> 00:20:17.175
for giving iniquity and transgression and sin.

368
00:20:17.395 --> 00:20:19.735
But who will no by no means clear the guilty,

369
00:20:20.815 --> 00:20:22.295
visiting the iniquity, the fathers on the children,

370
00:20:22.395 --> 00:20:23.615
the children's children, the third

371
00:20:23.615 --> 00:20:27.575
and fourth generation, he knew the character of God,

372
00:20:27.575 --> 00:20:30.335
that God Yahweh is a God of salvation.

373
00:20:30.635 --> 00:20:32.655
He knew he's a God of deliverance

374
00:20:32.675 --> 00:20:34.535
and he knew that God was actually near

375
00:20:34.555 --> 00:20:36.895
to him even if he didn't feel like it.

376
00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:44.425
David leaned on his faith on

377
00:20:44.425 --> 00:20:47.285
what he knew to be true over what he felt.

378
00:20:52.315 --> 00:20:54.375
Now we'll see in a moment that David did pray

379
00:20:54.525 --> 00:20:57.255
that God would judge the enemies attacking him.

380
00:20:58.385 --> 00:21:00.655
David did know that God would come through for him

381
00:21:01.075 --> 00:21:04.495
as his child, but David also knew

382
00:21:04.495 --> 00:21:05.695
that it wasn't just for him.

383
00:21:07.815 --> 00:21:08.985
Like I can get kind of selfish.

384
00:21:09.205 --> 00:21:11.305
God save me, deliver me all about me.

385
00:21:11.915 --> 00:21:14.265
David said, no, no, actually there's more to it.

386
00:21:16.085 --> 00:21:18.835
David said the deliverance God that you that I'm asking you

387
00:21:18.835 --> 00:21:20.075
for God give me deliverance.

388
00:21:20.075 --> 00:21:22.995
What I'm asking you for is not only for me, it's also

389
00:21:23.855 --> 00:21:25.395
to bless your people.

390
00:21:25.655 --> 00:21:30.595
God. Psalm 69, starting in verse 29,

391
00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:32.235
he's getting towards the end.

392
00:21:32.235 --> 00:21:36.315
Look at what he says. It says,

393
00:21:36.315 --> 00:21:37.955
but I'm afflicted and in pain.

394
00:21:38.455 --> 00:21:41.475
Let your salvation, oh God, set me on high.

395
00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:45.795
Now that sounds prideful, like show off God through my life.

396
00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:49.035
Notice I will praise the name of God with a song.

397
00:21:49.185 --> 00:21:50.835
I'll magnify him with thanksgiving.

398
00:21:51.385 --> 00:21:53.515
This will please the Lord more than an ox

399
00:21:53.535 --> 00:21:55.795
or a bull with horns and hoofs.

400
00:21:56.545 --> 00:21:58.875
Meaning the sacrifices you can do physically. No, no.

401
00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:01.555
My heart is what he wants. When the humble look at this,

402
00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.795
when the humble see it, they will be glad

403
00:22:05.495 --> 00:22:06.755
you who seek God.

404
00:22:06.895 --> 00:22:08.715
Let your hearts revive.

405
00:22:09.015 --> 00:22:10.715
For the Lord hears the needy

406
00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:14.795
and does not despise his own people who are prisoners.

407
00:22:16.975 --> 00:22:21.155
See, it takes maturity to be able to clinging

408
00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:24.155
to those promises even when you're in pain.

409
00:22:28.775 --> 00:22:32.285
But it's not impossible. See that?

410
00:22:32.425 --> 00:22:34.605
You hear that and you're like, there's no way how,

411
00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:36.445
how I suffering so deep.

412
00:22:36.465 --> 00:22:40.805
How could I do that? It only takes a mustard seed of faith.

413
00:22:41.025 --> 00:22:42.805
It only takes the faith of a child.

414
00:22:43.135 --> 00:22:46.445
Jesus says Because a child,

415
00:22:46.445 --> 00:22:48.085
what does a child say? Father, I trust

416
00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:49.085
You.

417
00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:52.645
That's it. Because it's not about the strength

418
00:22:52.665 --> 00:22:55.445
of your faith, it's about the object of your faith.

419
00:22:56.915 --> 00:22:59.885
It's who you're placing your faith in. That's the strength.

420
00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:06.855
And what we see here then is that your testimony

421
00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:11.535
through suffering blesses others deeply.

422
00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:16.615
Right? The humble will see it and be glad.

423
00:23:17.555 --> 00:23:20.855
That's a residual effect of God working in you.

424
00:23:21.765 --> 00:23:23.055
That other people are blessed.

425
00:23:24.565 --> 00:23:27.395
David was not just about himself, he was about others.

426
00:23:27.775 --> 00:23:30.155
But ultimately what we see David searching for,

427
00:23:31.615 --> 00:23:32.675
yes, he wanted deliverance.

428
00:23:32.675 --> 00:23:33.715
Yes, he wanted others to be blessed.

429
00:23:33.715 --> 00:23:36.555
But notice what he was looking to God for.

430
00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:42.675
He was looking to God for his joy. That was it.

431
00:23:42.865 --> 00:23:45.285
That was the main part of this.

432
00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:51.485
Verse three says, he was waiting for his God.

433
00:23:51.485 --> 00:23:54.085
Waiting for what? For joy

434
00:23:56.425 --> 00:23:57.685
in the Meyer, in the flood.

435
00:23:57.685 --> 00:23:59.805
He didn't feel joy. What is he waiting for? He wants joy.

436
00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:03.765
That's why he was consumed with zeal for God's house

437
00:24:03.765 --> 00:24:06.005
because he knew that's where joy was found.

438
00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:09.685
He knew God is faithful.

439
00:24:09.685 --> 00:24:12.685
He knew God would provide everything he ever needed.

440
00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.365
And like verse 16 says,

441
00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:17.325
he knew God's steadfast love is good.

442
00:24:17.675 --> 00:24:20.445
It's satisfying, it's joy inducing

443
00:24:21.555 --> 00:24:23.885
when you see God's covenant love for you,

444
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:27.845
yet here's what he was looking for.

445
00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:32.485
Ultimately that joy to be made complete,

446
00:24:34.235 --> 00:24:38.925
that joy to be made complete in the future when

447
00:24:38.925 --> 00:24:39.925
what we see at the very end

448
00:24:39.925 --> 00:24:42.205
of this psalm would actually come to pass.

449
00:24:42.485 --> 00:24:43.525
Starting in verse 34.

450
00:24:45.265 --> 00:24:49.285
He says, let heaven and earth praise God, the seas

451
00:24:49.345 --> 00:24:53.285
and everything that moves in them for God will save Zion.

452
00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:56.805
That's Jerusalem the hill and build up the cities of Judah.

453
00:24:57.065 --> 00:24:59.885
And people shall dwell there and possess it.

454
00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:02.685
The offspring of his servants shall inherit it

455
00:25:02.785 --> 00:25:06.765
and those who love his name shall dwell in it.

456
00:25:07.905 --> 00:25:12.205
See, that's why David was looking to God for his joy.

457
00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:17.245
'cause he's looking for a joy that cannot be fulfilled here.

458
00:25:17.565 --> 00:25:21.485
And now he's looking for that eternal

459
00:25:22.185 --> 00:25:24.085
joy found in the new heavens

460
00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:26.605
and new earth found when Zion is complete,

461
00:25:26.675 --> 00:25:29.925
when the eternal Zion actually comes to pass one day

462
00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:33.205
and all that God has ordained to happen will be finished

463
00:25:37.465 --> 00:25:41.125
and David knows which we should know.

464
00:25:43.005 --> 00:25:46.405
A future hope like that is

465
00:25:46.405 --> 00:25:48.165
what sustains you through the suffering.

466
00:25:48.165 --> 00:25:52.565
Even today, faith

467
00:25:52.715 --> 00:25:55.165
that God will finish the task

468
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.925
Ask Sustains you today.

469
00:26:01.825 --> 00:26:05.045
And so again, what we see in David is this type ideal

470
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:06.365
type of a servant.

471
00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:08.725
A template of what someone

472
00:26:08.745 --> 00:26:09.925
who followed the Lord would look like.

473
00:26:10.395 --> 00:26:13.725
He's not the only one. Jeremiah is another example.

474
00:26:14.925 --> 00:26:16.205
Jeremiah longed for the temple.

475
00:26:16.505 --> 00:26:18.125
He was cast off for his faith.

476
00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:19.885
He looked to the Lord for joy

477
00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.565
and deliverance while in exile.

478
00:26:22.085 --> 00:26:26.405
Jeremiah is a type of Christ. We see the pattern in Moses.

479
00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:30.365
Moses longed for God's presence in the tabernacle.

480
00:26:32.225 --> 00:26:34.285
He looked to God for deliverance from Egypt.

481
00:26:34.285 --> 00:26:38.565
Even listen to Hebrews 11 says, choosing rather

482
00:26:38.565 --> 00:26:40.645
to be mistreated with the people of God than

483
00:26:40.645 --> 00:26:42.485
to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.

484
00:26:43.065 --> 00:26:44.205
He considered the reproach

485
00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:46.605
of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt.

486
00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:49.045
For he was looking to the reward.

487
00:26:49.105 --> 00:26:50.725
That's the typical servant.

488
00:26:50.825 --> 00:26:54.125
We see David's pattern, it's shown up even in Moses,

489
00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:58.285
but we see it in ourselves too, don't we?

490
00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:03.285
Like if David is portrayed as the exemplary servant,

491
00:27:06.155 --> 00:27:09.045
then shouldn't there be some similarities in the way we live

492
00:27:09.065 --> 00:27:10.525
our lives as we serve the Lord?

493
00:27:14.535 --> 00:27:19.475
So what does that mean? It

494
00:27:19.475 --> 00:27:22.955
means we ought to be consumed by zeal for God's house too

495
00:27:26.155 --> 00:27:29.475
Ultimately for God's people, God's house.

496
00:27:29.775 --> 00:27:34.275
Now his presence to spend time with him

497
00:27:34.705 --> 00:27:36.795
because not only is he near to us, he's

498
00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:38.435
inside us as believers.

499
00:27:40.185 --> 00:27:42.715
What a gift. We get to have the zeal

500
00:27:43.935 --> 00:27:45.835
for God's house to be with him.

501
00:27:47.575 --> 00:27:50.275
That's what the servant of the Lord would be about.

502
00:27:52.855 --> 00:27:55.875
It means we should experience persecution for our faith.

503
00:27:58.425 --> 00:28:00.835
That that if we're truly living out

504
00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:04.035
what following Christ entails, Jesus said, trouble's coming.

505
00:28:07.305 --> 00:28:11.805
So are we experiencing that maybe we're not living

506
00:28:13.105 --> 00:28:14.925
as faithfully as we could.

507
00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:18.525
It also means we must submit ourselves to the Lord

508
00:28:18.985 --> 00:28:20.685
for his loving discipline in our lives.

509
00:28:20.885 --> 00:28:21.925
'cause none of us are perfect yet.

510
00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:24.765
So as a servant of the Lord, they get disciplined.

511
00:28:25.665 --> 00:28:30.005
That's us. It means we ought

512
00:28:30.005 --> 00:28:32.605
to be dependent on God for deliverance from the things

513
00:28:32.605 --> 00:28:33.605
that we face in our lives,

514
00:28:35.075 --> 00:28:37.845
that we shouldn't trust our own intelligence

515
00:28:38.105 --> 00:28:40.605
or our own resources or our own creativity.

516
00:28:40.665 --> 00:28:42.685
To get out of situations, we need to say, God,

517
00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:45.045
you got this, and trust him.

518
00:28:48.865 --> 00:28:51.485
And it means like David here at the end, we must be looking

519
00:28:51.485 --> 00:28:55.925
to heaven for our true joy to have a measure

520
00:28:56.065 --> 00:28:59.845
of the joy of the Lord both today and for eternity.

521
00:28:59.845 --> 00:29:04.285
That we are satisfied in Him alone, not in here what we see.

522
00:29:06.825 --> 00:29:08.645
So there's a measure of David being a typical servant.

523
00:29:08.745 --> 00:29:10.005
We can learn from that.

524
00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:13.725
But here's the thing about David, Jeremiah, Moses,

525
00:29:13.905 --> 00:29:17.845
all those Old Testament servants, all of each of us today

526
00:29:18.105 --> 00:29:21.405
as well, every one of us, every one of them is a

527
00:29:21.995 --> 00:29:24.365
limited imperfect servant.

528
00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:29.065
Yes, setting a good example at times,

529
00:29:30.325 --> 00:29:31.985
but we're all still tainted.

530
00:29:36.255 --> 00:29:39.235
And so there's, there's one that we have yet to talk about.

531
00:29:39.915 --> 00:29:42.005
A servant of the Lord

532
00:29:43.905 --> 00:29:46.595
Who is the perfect servant whose

533
00:29:46.595 --> 00:29:47.595
Name is Christ.

534
00:29:49.735 --> 00:29:50.995
Yes, David's a great example.

535
00:29:52.145 --> 00:29:53.715
He's the typical servant,

536
00:29:54.895 --> 00:29:57.875
but the one to whom all those others were pointing,

537
00:29:58.585 --> 00:30:02.075
including you and me, is the perfect servant,

538
00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:03.645
Jesus Christ.

539
00:30:06.145 --> 00:30:07.845
See, like we did last week, we can look

540
00:30:07.865 --> 00:30:12.485
to the New Testament to see how it uses this psalm

541
00:30:12.705 --> 00:30:15.085
to help us understand even

542
00:30:15.085 --> 00:30:16.645
what we're reading here in Psalm 69

543
00:30:16.665 --> 00:30:19.205
and thankfully Psalm 69 is one

544
00:30:19.205 --> 00:30:21.285
of the most quoted in the New Testament.

545
00:30:22.755 --> 00:30:25.245
Only Psalm 22 has more quotations.

546
00:30:26.105 --> 00:30:27.125
So what does that mean for us?

547
00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:30.885
Well, it means that Psalm 69 portrays David,

548
00:30:32.305 --> 00:30:36.805
his experience as a type to foreshadow the greater son

549
00:30:37.115 --> 00:30:40.005
that he was going to have what he would endure.

550
00:30:41.195 --> 00:30:43.845
David's the type. And so the way the New Testament uses it

551
00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:48.445
is that that Jesus would endure who's often referred to

552
00:30:48.445 --> 00:30:49.965
by the way, as the Son of David,

553
00:30:52.115 --> 00:30:54.565
what Jesus would endure is actually something

554
00:30:55.435 --> 00:30:57.365
that we can learn from David's

555
00:30:57.365 --> 00:30:58.645
experience and see how it works.

556
00:30:58.705 --> 00:30:59.765
We can also see Jesus,

557
00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.445
how he would exemplify the perfect servant of God

558
00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:03.805
that David was limited in doing.

559
00:31:04.755 --> 00:31:07.565
This is why we must read our Bibles as a whole

560
00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:11.255
and here's how Jesus, at least four ways,

561
00:31:11.515 --> 00:31:14.215
how he shows him himself to be the perfect servant

562
00:31:14.675 --> 00:31:15.695
of God for us.

563
00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:20.055
First it's in how Christ was perfect at obeying the Father.

564
00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:26.065
How he obeyed his father.

565
00:31:28.485 --> 00:31:32.865
See John 18 or John 8 29 says, Jesus says,

566
00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:35.385
I always do the things that are pleasing to him.

567
00:31:38.255 --> 00:31:41.025
Hebrews four 15, he was tempted in every way as we are.

568
00:31:41.045 --> 00:31:45.345
Yet he never sinned. He perfectly obeyed the Father.

569
00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:48.545
Plus there's this, this is where we see the, the connection.

570
00:31:49.765 --> 00:31:52.105
You remember the line in Psalm six nine, David said,

571
00:31:52.145 --> 00:31:53.985
I was consumed by zeal for God's house.

572
00:31:54.965 --> 00:31:57.905
Listen to this scene in John chapter two in the New

573
00:31:58.105 --> 00:32:01.825
Testament it says, the Passover of the Jews was at hand

574
00:32:01.845 --> 00:32:03.385
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

575
00:32:03.885 --> 00:32:06.465
In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep

576
00:32:06.465 --> 00:32:08.505
and pigeons, the money changers sitting there

577
00:32:08.685 --> 00:32:09.825
and making a whip.

578
00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:11.665
I love this picture of Jesus, right?

579
00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:13.985
He's not just sitting on a rock conditioned hair like he

580
00:32:13.985 --> 00:32:15.425
makes a whip of cords

581
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:19.345
and he drove them all outta the temple with the sheep

582
00:32:19.345 --> 00:32:22.025
and oxen and he poured out the coins of the money changers

583
00:32:22.025 --> 00:32:23.505
and overturned their tables

584
00:32:25.085 --> 00:32:26.665
and he told those who sold the pigeons,

585
00:32:26.665 --> 00:32:27.705
take these things away.

586
00:32:28.085 --> 00:32:31.025
Do not make my father's house a house of trade.

587
00:32:32.485 --> 00:32:35.865
But listen, his disciples remembered that it was written,

588
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:38.785
zeal for your house will consume me.

589
00:32:41.425 --> 00:32:46.125
And where did they get that? Psalm 69. Right?

590
00:32:46.595 --> 00:32:47.605
They tied it together.

591
00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:50.125
What Jesus just did in the temple is

592
00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:51.885
what David felt in Psalm 69.

593
00:32:52.145 --> 00:32:56.935
But the, the part that David never saw was that zeal

594
00:32:56.955 --> 00:33:00.415
for God's house would actually consume Jesus

595
00:33:02.045 --> 00:33:04.535
because later those same religious leaders would

596
00:33:04.535 --> 00:33:05.615
come for him and kill him.

597
00:33:05.635 --> 00:33:08.955
That's right. That's the difference.

598
00:33:10.095 --> 00:33:13.435
The perfect servant obeying the Father even unto death.

599
00:33:15.855 --> 00:33:17.435
That's first. We also see Christ

600
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.155
as our perfect servant in carrying our reproach.

601
00:33:22.985 --> 00:33:25.995
This is how Jesus exemplifies a perfect servant.

602
00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:28.355
Remember how David, he struggled

603
00:33:29.425 --> 00:33:30.915
with the scorn of God's enemies.

604
00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:33.515
They were piling it on him. He was suffering for his faith.

605
00:33:33.615 --> 00:33:36.555
We saw it. Psalm 69, verse nine.

606
00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:40.195
He says, the reproaches of those who reproach you,

607
00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:42.675
God have fallen on me.

608
00:33:44.985 --> 00:33:48.625
Well, listen, the Apostle Paul in the New Testament, listen

609
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:51.625
to how he adapts that and applies it to Jesus.

610
00:33:51.845 --> 00:33:56.065
Romans 15, let each of us please his neighbor for his good

611
00:33:56.085 --> 00:33:59.025
to build him up for Christ, did not please himself,

612
00:33:59.325 --> 00:34:01.905
but as it is written, the reproaches of those

613
00:34:01.925 --> 00:34:03.585
who reproached you fell on me.

614
00:34:06.095 --> 00:34:09.545
Where'd he get that? He got it from Psalm 69.

615
00:34:11.255 --> 00:34:13.785
Because remember, Jesus didn't have to die.

616
00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:16.705
Jesus didn't have to have the reproaches fall in him.

617
00:34:16.705 --> 00:34:18.505
He was sinless. He was perfect.

618
00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:21.065
He did not deserve any reproach.

619
00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:25.145
But not only did he take the unjust ones directed at him

620
00:34:25.295 --> 00:34:29.225
like David did, Jesus also took the just ones

621
00:34:29.455 --> 00:34:31.785
that we deserved and he took it on himself.

622
00:34:34.085 --> 00:34:36.225
The reproaches of those who approach you fall on me.

623
00:34:36.605 --> 00:34:39.385
Not only that, I'm taking all the reproaches

624
00:34:39.855 --> 00:34:41.825
that everyone else deserves.

625
00:34:41.825 --> 00:34:43.345
Second Corinthians 5 21.

626
00:34:43.365 --> 00:34:47.625
For our sake, he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so

627
00:34:47.625 --> 00:34:50.025
that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

628
00:34:50.365 --> 00:34:54.225
That's exactly, He took the punishment.

629
00:34:54.485 --> 00:34:57.065
We deserved the judgment.

630
00:34:57.365 --> 00:34:59.705
The reproaches due us so

631
00:34:59.705 --> 00:35:01.545
that we could be free from all of that.

632
00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:07.105
That's what Philippians chapter two says, one

633
00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.865
of the most famous passages about Jesus.

634
00:35:09.045 --> 00:35:10.945
He says, though he was in the form of God,

635
00:35:11.165 --> 00:35:14.145
he did not count equality with God a thing to be held onto,

636
00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:18.265
but he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,

637
00:35:19.995 --> 00:35:22.865
being born in the likeness of men being found in human form.

638
00:35:22.865 --> 00:35:27.345
He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point

639
00:35:27.345 --> 00:35:29.745
of death, even death on a cross.

640
00:35:32.245 --> 00:35:36.865
He served you. He served me by suffering our reproach so

641
00:35:36.865 --> 00:35:41.285
that if we put our faith in him, he takes away our reproach.

642
00:35:41.285 --> 00:35:43.565
We don't have to carry our reproaches anymore.

643
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.045
They are all on him.

644
00:35:45.185 --> 00:35:48.405
Now, that's good news,

645
00:35:51.665 --> 00:35:52.925
but there's another major difference here.

646
00:35:54.905 --> 00:35:57.165
Christ, the perfect servant, David, the typical servant

647
00:35:58.585 --> 00:36:00.365
in David's prayer in Psalm 69.

648
00:36:00.365 --> 00:36:01.445
You can go read this all later.

649
00:36:01.585 --> 00:36:04.805
He, he prays curses on his enemies.

650
00:36:06.645 --> 00:36:09.285
I mean, it's things like the middle section of Psalm 69.

651
00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:11.405
Let their table before them become a snare.

652
00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:12.605
Let their eyes be dark

653
00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:14.645
and pour out your indignation upon them.

654
00:36:15.145 --> 00:36:18.365
May there can't be a desolation. Add to them punishment.

655
00:36:19.225 --> 00:36:21.045
Be blotted outta the book of the living.

656
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:23.885
Those are known as imprecatory prayers.

657
00:36:26.525 --> 00:36:27.545
But what do we do with that?

658
00:36:29.575 --> 00:36:31.785
Like are we free to pray that stuff?

659
00:36:31.785 --> 00:36:32.785
Because some of you're like, I'm thinking

660
00:36:32.785 --> 00:36:33.825
that right now about that guy.

661
00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:36.425
Like, no. Are we?

662
00:36:36.805 --> 00:36:38.345
Are we supposed to pray those kind of things?

663
00:36:39.735 --> 00:36:41.865
Well, this is again where the New Testament helps us

664
00:36:44.065 --> 00:36:47.195
because both Acts one with Judas

665
00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:49.595
and Romans 11 with Israel,

666
00:36:50.345 --> 00:36:54.075
they both quote this part of Psalm 69.

667
00:36:57.265 --> 00:37:02.205
And in both instances, the author uses it against those

668
00:37:02.305 --> 00:37:05.565
who are attacking God, not attacking him.

669
00:37:09.945 --> 00:37:13.755
That it's a a judgment thing that God, you are going

670
00:37:13.755 --> 00:37:15.795
to bring final judgment on your enemies.

671
00:37:15.855 --> 00:37:18.435
That's right. Not God.

672
00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:20.475
Take care of this guy who's making me mad.

673
00:37:22.025 --> 00:37:25.915
It's God. You'll bring justice. Vengeance is God's.

674
00:37:27.215 --> 00:37:28.995
That's why they're quoting it.

675
00:37:30.015 --> 00:37:32.115
Not only that, so that limits us.

676
00:37:32.115 --> 00:37:33.035
But not only that, do you remember how

677
00:37:33.035 --> 00:37:34.155
Jesus handled his enemies?

678
00:37:36.945 --> 00:37:39.755
Like how did Jesus handle those who were coming at him,

679
00:37:39.755 --> 00:37:41.955
those who opposed him as the perfect servant?

680
00:37:42.095 --> 00:37:45.955
He was focused on loving his enemies. Remember that?

681
00:37:47.585 --> 00:37:50.675
Like that's what he taught us in Matthew five.

682
00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.755
He says, love your enemies, those who persecute you.

683
00:37:55.135 --> 00:37:58.035
But even on the cross,

684
00:38:00.095 --> 00:38:04.115
he is literally getting attacked, getting made fun

685
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:07.435
of getting nailed, getting to the cross, getting killed.

686
00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:09.035
He's dying on it.

687
00:38:09.255 --> 00:38:10.755
All of this, he's feeling

688
00:38:10.865 --> 00:38:15.135
this and what did he say?

689
00:38:15.445 --> 00:38:18.535
Like he had just received sour wine.

690
00:38:19.845 --> 00:38:23.775
Like David in Psalm 69, he just received sour.

691
00:38:23.845 --> 00:38:28.285
What did he say on the cross

692
00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:32.125
about his enemies, about those crucifying?

693
00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:37.125
Father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing.

694
00:38:39.225 --> 00:38:42.325
He had every right in that moment to call down curses

695
00:38:43.145 --> 00:38:48.045
and not just like words curses from heaven to wipe them out.

696
00:38:50.035 --> 00:38:54.005
Instead, he said, no, I'm laughing them.

697
00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:57.205
And listen, that's what Jesus did for you

698
00:38:57.345 --> 00:38:58.765
and me as his enemies.

699
00:39:00.225 --> 00:39:04.725
He took the cross. So why can't we do that for others?

700
00:39:06.475 --> 00:39:09.815
We precursors or we love them like Jesus loved us.

701
00:39:14.075 --> 00:39:16.095
And listen, Jesus, this perfect

702
00:39:16.605 --> 00:39:19.495
servant, he did all that.

703
00:39:19.495 --> 00:39:22.415
He did. Obeyed the father, carried our reproach, loved us.

704
00:39:22.755 --> 00:39:26.695
He did it because his mission was securing our eternity.

705
00:39:29.115 --> 00:39:31.375
The perfect servant securing our eternity.

706
00:39:31.545 --> 00:39:34.695
David, the typical servant, was looking ahead to eternity.

707
00:39:34.795 --> 00:39:37.575
Christ, the perfect servant was securing our eternity.

708
00:39:40.315 --> 00:39:41.935
That's the Psalm 69.

709
00:39:41.935 --> 00:39:43.935
The end of it showed us David was looking to God

710
00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:47.095
for his eternal joy, and Christ has secured it for us.

711
00:39:47.205 --> 00:39:48.295
What has he secured?

712
00:39:48.355 --> 00:39:51.575
He secured praised from every nation, every creature.

713
00:39:51.795 --> 00:39:54.735
He secured a permanent dwelling place in the new

714
00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:56.055
eternal Zion.

715
00:39:56.195 --> 00:39:59.015
And it says, for those who love his name,

716
00:40:01.675 --> 00:40:05.695
that's what we've seen today, that those

717
00:40:05.755 --> 00:40:07.175
who love his name

718
00:40:10.685 --> 00:40:13.385
are those who are consumed by zeal for his house.

719
00:40:15.595 --> 00:40:18.585
Those who are willing to face persecution for their faith

720
00:40:22.095 --> 00:40:26.945
with boldness, they are those who look to him

721
00:40:27.205 --> 00:40:30.625
for deliverance and for joy,

722
00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:35.905
and they seek to obey him with everything they are.

723
00:40:35.935 --> 00:40:38.185
Even to the extent of loving your enemies,

724
00:40:40.775 --> 00:40:44.805
those who love his name, do those kinds of things

725
00:40:44.835 --> 00:40:47.645
that David typified, that Jesus perfected.

726
00:40:48.065 --> 00:40:49.125
Why do they do those things?

727
00:40:49.235 --> 00:40:52.485
Because he has carried our reproach

728
00:40:52.665 --> 00:40:54.925
and he has secured our eternity.

729
00:40:57.425 --> 00:41:02.165
That's why we worship the son of David, the perfect

730
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:03.845
suffering servant.

731
00:41:05.265 --> 00:41:06.725
That's why we worship him.
