WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:19.435
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:23.555
Yes, this means it is the final sermon in this incredible

3
00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.115
series we've been walking through over the last few months.

4
00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:29.795
Uh, really closing the entire narrative of first

5
00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.355
and second Samuel, the story of David.

6
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:36.035
As we've watched this journey play out over the last few

7
00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:39.555
months and even a over a year ago, we started First Samuel

8
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.235
Plus, as you can tell, because

9
00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:44.195
of the decorations we're moving into the Christmas season.

10
00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:45.915
And so, uh, next week

11
00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:48.275
I did not anticipate that was gonna get claps.

12
00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:51.355
So, okay, so, uh, it's great. I love Christmas two.

13
00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:55.915
Um, next week we are starting a new series through, uh,

14
00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:57.515
Luke one and two.

15
00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:01.555
So we're gonna actually just take the story of this king

16
00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:02.875
that we've been looking for.

17
00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:06.835
The promised one, he actually showed up.

18
00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:09.835
And so that's this promise to presence idea.

19
00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:12.795
What's the actual story of how that happened?

20
00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.035
The not some unique spin on Christmas.

21
00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:17.755
We're just taking the literal story

22
00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:19.795
and explaining what happened.

23
00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:22.995
You'll also want to get the daily email

24
00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:24.155
that goes alongside it.

25
00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:25.435
There'll be a QR code.

26
00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.195
You can see that you might, uh, go ahead

27
00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:29.395
and scan that if you want, uh,

28
00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:31.075
from December one through December 24.

29
00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:33.835
We'll be a daily email helping you read

30
00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:36.955
through the advent season of, of what, who is God,

31
00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:40.635
who is Jesus that we're looking at in Luke one

32
00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.435
and two, Aaron Ferguson, one of our elders went ahead

33
00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:44.995
and, uh, put that together for us.

34
00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:46.595
And so you can grab that

35
00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:48.355
and if you are already on the list from last

36
00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:49.915
year, you're on a list still.

37
00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:53.355
But, uh, if you want a new fresh take on Christmas,

38
00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:54.475
go ahead and take a look at that.

39
00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:59.155
But like I said, today we are finishing our journey really,

40
00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:04.075
uh, through all that we've seen God do in David's life

41
00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:06.995
and, and in Israel in that season of time, he saw

42
00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:09.035
how the first king Saul, he had died

43
00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:11.715
and then David ascends to the throne, kinda rises

44
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.235
to the throne and all

45
00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:15.075
that God's blessings brought with that.

46
00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:16.995
There was a covenant that God made with David,

47
00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:20.115
and it really just an incredible spiritual,

48
00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:22.675
powerful moment in David's life, season of life.

49
00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.475
The rise to the throne was that.

50
00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:28.155
But we also saw how David, just like Saul had done,

51
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:31.075
he ventured into sin, got in trouble,

52
00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:32.835
especially Bathsheba and Uriah.

53
00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:34.715
There was some mess there, of course, how much

54
00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:37.955
that cost him, cost his family, cost his nation.

55
00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:42.035
So there was a rise and there was a fall.

56
00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:43.515
He was covered by grace.

57
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:45.675
We've seen that over and over again, covered by grace.

58
00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:49.355
But there were consequences for his sin.

59
00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:52.465
Well, sadly, here at the end

60
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:56.025
of David's life here at Second Samuel chapter

61
00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:57.825
24, it happens again.

62
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:04.475
And there is a great cost to what David does.

63
00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:10.265
And so my hope today is to again, point to God's character,

64
00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:13.345
to his holiness, to his righteousness of his justice,

65
00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:19.055
but also to to point to the nature of his grace.

66
00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:23.485
That yes, consequences of sin are there

67
00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:24.805
and and they will be there.

68
00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:30.645
But God, how he, how he provides forgiveness for those

69
00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:35.485
who humbly return to him hope we can all walk away

70
00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:39.005
with that kind of idea as we go towards him.

71
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:40.165
Let's pray towards that now.

72
00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:43.565
Lord, thank you for the opportunity to be here

73
00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:46.125
studying your word, worshiping you, responding

74
00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.925
to you being in fellowship and community together.

75
00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:51.885
We pray, God, that you in your glory would

76
00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:53.605
shine brightly today.

77
00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:56.805
That it's not my words, it's not anything I've come up with.

78
00:03:56.955 --> 00:04:00.365
It's you by your spirit, speaking through your word,

79
00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:04.035
applying it to each of our lives uniquely and

80
00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:07.115
and showing us what we need to learn and remember and obey

81
00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.995
and receive as well today.

82
00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:16.275
Do that for your glory and our good. In Jesus' name, amen.

83
00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:21.435
And so as we turn to Second Samuel chapter 24,

84
00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:23.715
we're gonna look first at verse one down

85
00:04:23.715 --> 00:04:24.955
through the first part of verse 10,

86
00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:27.155
and you'll see where we're going with this.

87
00:04:28.495 --> 00:04:32.475
Second Samuel 24 verse one, to start again,

88
00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:36.635
the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel

89
00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:40.475
and he incited David against them saying,

90
00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:42.395
go number Israel and Judah.

91
00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.235
So the king said to Joab, the commander of the army who was

92
00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:48.275
with him, go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan

93
00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:49.675
to be Sheba and number the people

94
00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:51.755
that I may know, the number of the people.

95
00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:55.435
But Joab said to the king, may the Lord your God add

96
00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:57.035
to the people a hundred times as many

97
00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:58.835
as they are while the eyes of my Lord,

98
00:04:58.855 --> 00:04:59.915
the kings still see it,

99
00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:03.435
but why does my Lord the king delight in this thing?

100
00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.865
But the king's word prevailed against

101
00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:08.025
Joab and the commanders of the army.

102
00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:10.305
So Joab and the commanders

103
00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:12.025
of the Army went out from the presence of the king

104
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.105
to number the people of Israel.

105
00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:17.465
They crossed the Jordan began from rower, from the city

106
00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:18.825
that's in the middle of the valley toward

107
00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:20.065
Gad and onto Jayer.

108
00:05:20.065 --> 00:05:22.025
Then they came to Gilead, to Kadesh

109
00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:23.825
and land of Hitite came to Dan.

110
00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:26.505
From Dan. They went to Seiden from the fortress of Tyre

111
00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:27.905
and to all the cities, the HIEs

112
00:05:27.905 --> 00:05:28.945
and the Canaanites, they went out

113
00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.225
to the Neba Judah at Be Sheva.

114
00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:32.785
I went through that really quickly.

115
00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:34.825
Those are just a bunch of cities scattered all

116
00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:36.065
over the land.

117
00:05:36.115 --> 00:05:37.305
North, south, east, west.

118
00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:38.425
They went everywhere,

119
00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:43.245
all over the land counting people, verse eight.

120
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:46.725
So when they had gone through all the land, they came

121
00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:49.365
to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days.

122
00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:52.725
And Joab gave the sum of the numbering

123
00:05:52.725 --> 00:05:53.805
of the people to the king.

124
00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:58.565
In Israel. There were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword

125
00:05:59.335 --> 00:06:03.875
and the men of Judah were 500,000, verse 10.

126
00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.995
But David's heart struck him

127
00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:09.235
after he had numbered the people.

128
00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.455
We'll come back and finish that here in a second,

129
00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:17.455
but let's just first start examining what's going on here.

130
00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:20.975
Now, there's a lot of debates actually about this passage,

131
00:06:23.345 --> 00:06:27.605
and it revolves around verse one where it says that God

132
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:29.165
incited David.

133
00:06:31.465 --> 00:06:36.085
So the question is, did God cause David to sin like this?

134
00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:39.555
Well, that can't be true

135
00:06:39.555 --> 00:06:44.435
because we see in James one 13, the New Testament says this,

136
00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:48.675
let no one say when he's tempted, I'm being tempted by God.

137
00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:50.835
For God cannot be tempted with evil,

138
00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:53.715
and he himself tempts no one.

139
00:06:56.295 --> 00:06:57.435
So what was happening here?

140
00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:01.525
Well, notice at the beginning of verse one,

141
00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:02.605
we've gotta read carefully.

142
00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:05.085
The beginning of verse one said, the anger

143
00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:09.895
of the Lord was kindled against Israel already,

144
00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:11.695
like before anything with David,

145
00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:14.015
before anything with this census, it was already

146
00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:17.495
the anger the Lord was incited against kindled against

147
00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:19.735
Israel, which means that David, himself

148
00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:22.655
or entire nation was already sinning.

149
00:07:23.565 --> 00:07:27.975
Something was already disobedient to God.

150
00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:33.535
God was just using what was happening next, what happened in

151
00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:36.215
what we read to expose it

152
00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.775
and to discipline his people.

153
00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:44.855
There's a complicating factor here that causes the question

154
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.135
because there's a parallel passage

155
00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:49.935
to this actually in one Chronicles 21, where it

156
00:07:50.535 --> 00:07:52.175
specifically says it was Satan

157
00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:55.335
who incited David to number the people.

158
00:07:56.515 --> 00:07:58.335
And so is that a contradiction like the Bible

159
00:07:58.365 --> 00:07:59.575
just, oh, well, there's the proof.

160
00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:00.735
The Bible can't be trusted

161
00:08:00.735 --> 00:08:02.735
because it says here and here, and it's different.

162
00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:08.055
Actually, what I believe is going on here is that sometimes

163
00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:12.415
God sovereignly permits Satan to act

164
00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:15.935
in order to accomplish God's purposes.

165
00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:20.165
You can see it back in Genesis 50 verse 20, Joseph

166
00:08:20.715 --> 00:08:22.125
sold into slavery by his brothers.

167
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.845
That would've been Satan's temptation,

168
00:08:23.845 --> 00:08:25.765
but it ended up that what you intended for evil,

169
00:08:25.825 --> 00:08:27.285
God intended for good, that many

170
00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:28.365
people would be kept alive, right?

171
00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:31.325
So it was God's allowing something so

172
00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:33.485
that this would come about his purpose.

173
00:08:34.475 --> 00:08:36.965
It's the same thing I believe is happening here.

174
00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:38.565
God does that all the time.

175
00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:43.645
God uses Satan's efforts in various ways,

176
00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:46.285
like to refine or to discipline

177
00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:50.805
or to purify disobedient believers.

178
00:08:52.035 --> 00:08:53.595
I believe that's what's happening here.

179
00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:56.325
God allowed Satan to tempt David,

180
00:08:57.395 --> 00:08:59.185
kinda like Job in a way.

181
00:08:59.795 --> 00:09:01.585
Satan goes to God, can I do this to him?

182
00:09:01.585 --> 00:09:04.105
And God's like, okay, God allowed Satan

183
00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:07.435
to tempt David and David gave in.

184
00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:09.235
David was fully responsible for giving in

185
00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:11.075
and sinning in this way.

186
00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:17.015
And so what was the problem that God wanted

187
00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.695
to expose in David using this mechanism?

188
00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.665
Well, I believe most likely it was pride,

189
00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.585
trusting in himself his own strength.

190
00:09:30.605 --> 00:09:33.385
He was wanting to make sure his army was strong enough,

191
00:09:34.935 --> 00:09:36.515
and it kind of feels noble

192
00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:38.235
because his, he's at the end of his life,

193
00:09:38.295 --> 00:09:41.475
and so his son Solomon is about to take over as the king.

194
00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:43.395
And so you can imagine David even saying, well,

195
00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:46.475
I wanna make sure my son has enough military strength

196
00:09:46.735 --> 00:09:48.675
to be able to project to the world

197
00:09:48.825 --> 00:09:51.235
that we're okay as the transition happens.

198
00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:52.995
I wanna make sure Solomon's got what he needs.

199
00:09:53.815 --> 00:09:55.515
We need to count and make sure.

200
00:09:59.035 --> 00:10:01.405
Well, that's still pride

201
00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:05.365
because all of that language is about trusting in something

202
00:10:05.455 --> 00:10:08.205
other than the one who protects them.

203
00:10:10.035 --> 00:10:11.925
It's trusting in your own strength.

204
00:10:11.925 --> 00:10:13.725
And so the pride in David or,

205
00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:15.645
or maybe he was actually just saying, man,

206
00:10:15.805 --> 00:10:16.885
I wanna know how many people I have.

207
00:10:16.925 --> 00:10:18.005
I wanna see how great I am.

208
00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:21.445
That's all pride led to this kind of sin.

209
00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.925
So clearly David, at the end

210
00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:27.325
of his life needed further refining.

211
00:10:31.675 --> 00:10:33.375
And don't forget what I said at the right

212
00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.375
before that, David was at the end of his life here.

213
00:10:38.475 --> 00:10:41.575
He had followed Yahweh for decades.

214
00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:46.355
He was called a man after God's own heart.

215
00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:50.515
He wrote half the Psalms that we have in our Bibles today.

216
00:10:50.855 --> 00:10:54.875
He was this spiritual giant, yet he was not

217
00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:58.315
beyond the reach of devastating sin.

218
00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:04.015
Maybe he was trusting in himself,

219
00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:07.695
maybe he was leaning on his past, whatever it was,

220
00:11:07.755 --> 00:11:11.735
he was failing to press forward in his relationship

221
00:11:11.885 --> 00:11:16.745
with God, and it got him in serious

222
00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:18.185
trouble again.

223
00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:23.825
It led him to have to repent again.

224
00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:30.155
I don't know, I'm trying to put myself in David's shoes.

225
00:11:30.165 --> 00:11:34.515
Maybe he even felt immune to the things

226
00:11:34.515 --> 00:11:36.755
that tripped him up when he was younger in his life.

227
00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:38.115
It's like, I got that beat.

228
00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:40.235
I don't have to worry about that anymore. I can handle it.

229
00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:41.915
And maybe he felt immune,

230
00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:43.435
like I don't have to worry about it.

231
00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:46.725
Now here, here's the point.

232
00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:51.915
My hope, like when I face temptation,

233
00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:55.335
when you face temptation,

234
00:11:57.275 --> 00:11:59.815
my hope cannot be, should not be.

235
00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:02.415
My hope is not in myself.

236
00:12:04.225 --> 00:12:08.335
It's in Christ alone. Like when you face temptation.

237
00:12:09.045 --> 00:12:12.415
When I face temptation, our only hope for victory,

238
00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:14.775
our only hope to overcome it, our only hope

239
00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:17.495
to beat it is not in ourselves in any way.

240
00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:19.135
It's not in anything in us.

241
00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:23.375
Our hope is in Christ.

242
00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:28.825
Do not think that

243
00:12:28.825 --> 00:12:31.825
because you followed the Lord for many years

244
00:12:34.075 --> 00:12:35.975
or, or because that you have this heart

245
00:12:35.975 --> 00:12:38.295
after God like David did, and you love Jesus

246
00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:41.735
and you, you look like you do or or don't think that just

247
00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:43.335
because you are here right now

248
00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:45.055
and you go to church most often

249
00:12:45.315 --> 00:12:46.935
and you're those kind of people, right?

250
00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:50.535
Don't think that somehow you are immune to sin.

251
00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:57.815
The moment we trust in our own spiritual resume,

252
00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:04.275
the moment we count our victories over things in the past,

253
00:13:04.465 --> 00:13:06.875
instead of casting ourselves upon Christ,

254
00:13:07.055 --> 00:13:09.675
that's the moment we are ripe for tripping up.

255
00:13:12.845 --> 00:13:15.525
I love this verse. We always memorize verse 13

256
00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:19.085
of one Corinthians 10, but, but listen to verse 12.

257
00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:24.605
Let anyone who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.

258
00:13:27.805 --> 00:13:30.895
Like, if I think I've got it together, I'm doing okay.

259
00:13:31.275 --> 00:13:34.055
I'm right there. I've, I've got it all figured out.

260
00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:40.255
Be afraid because that's the time.

261
00:13:40.485 --> 00:13:42.455
Most likely you're gonna fall,

262
00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:47.925
stay alert again, David needed,

263
00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:50.925
and God wanted to expose the pride

264
00:13:51.475 --> 00:13:54.245
lurking in David's heart and hear me.

265
00:13:54.305 --> 00:13:56.805
He wants to expose the pride lurking in your heart.

266
00:13:57.105 --> 00:14:01.705
And in my heart, he exalts those

267
00:14:01.705 --> 00:14:06.055
who are humble and he humbles those who exalt themselves.

268
00:14:09.235 --> 00:14:10.535
So here's what all this means for us.

269
00:14:10.635 --> 00:14:14.295
It means we must flee self-confidence.

270
00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:18.225
And I don't say that in a way like the world says,

271
00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:20.225
be confident in yourself and all these things, okay?

272
00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:24.105
What I'm talking about here is fleeing the self-confidence

273
00:14:24.105 --> 00:14:26.625
that your strength you think is in your

274
00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:28.385
own spiritual track record.

275
00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:30.505
My strength is in my track record,

276
00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:32.785
but it's not that my strength is not in

277
00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:36.065
that my strength is in finished work for me.

278
00:14:41.405 --> 00:14:45.745
The battle against sin is never over until you die

279
00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:47.105
or until Jesus comes back.

280
00:14:47.895 --> 00:14:50.785
It's a day by day moment by moment struggle against

281
00:14:51.435 --> 00:14:53.085
this enemy we have.

282
00:14:53.345 --> 00:14:57.045
And so we have to stand in the victory that he has already.

283
00:14:57.145 --> 00:14:59.245
Christ has already won for us.

284
00:14:59.745 --> 00:15:02.205
All the battles that you think you've conquered,

285
00:15:02.425 --> 00:15:03.685
you can't rest in those.

286
00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:04.885
You can't trust those

287
00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:07.725
because they will not last in that moment.

288
00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:12.715
If you're not leaning on Christ, they can help you.

289
00:15:12.715 --> 00:15:13.795
They can build a foundation,

290
00:15:13.815 --> 00:15:15.955
but they can't last if you're not in the

291
00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:17.275
moment resting in Christ.

292
00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:23.845
And I'm gonna be honest, this is, this is what I've noticed

293
00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:28.095
as I get to sit with this all week, I,

294
00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:29.735
I've recognized that this is something

295
00:15:29.755 --> 00:15:30.855
I'm especially prone to.

296
00:15:33.405 --> 00:15:34.565
I can look back in my life

297
00:15:34.565 --> 00:15:37.525
and I can see a lot of God's spiritual blessings in me.

298
00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:40.165
I can see that I've preached a lot of sermons.

299
00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:41.965
I've studied the Bible a long time.

300
00:15:41.995 --> 00:15:43.365
I've read a lot of books. I've got

301
00:15:43.365 --> 00:15:44.445
two degrees from seminary.

302
00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:46.885
I've got this stuff. I all of these things, these,

303
00:15:47.075 --> 00:15:51.165
this resume and in those really good things, hear me,

304
00:15:51.545 --> 00:15:53.205
it can make it really easy

305
00:15:53.345 --> 00:15:55.885
to coast in my relationship with God.

306
00:16:01.005 --> 00:16:05.655
Like there's enough past investment in here that is

307
00:16:05.755 --> 00:16:07.095
so easy for me

308
00:16:07.095 --> 00:16:08.655
to just make it look like I've got

309
00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:09.775
it all together spiritually.

310
00:16:12.095 --> 00:16:15.345
Like I can manufacture enough, I can pull enough of this out

311
00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:16.945
and I can say, well, here's how this works.

312
00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:19.545
And I can sound good, look like I know how to do that

313
00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:23.425
because I've got decades of this process built into me.

314
00:16:23.845 --> 00:16:25.905
The problem with that, think about

315
00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:27.785
what happens when water gets

316
00:16:27.985 --> 00:16:32.985
stagnant, right?

317
00:16:33.805 --> 00:16:36.745
It gets nasty. It becomes a hazard.

318
00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:41.865
When water stops moving, it becomes a breeding ground

319
00:16:41.925 --> 00:16:44.625
for mosquitoes, for bacteria.

320
00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.505
It becomes something you would never want to be a part of.

321
00:16:47.605 --> 00:16:52.145
It grows algae. It gets disgusting because it's not moving.

322
00:16:54.985 --> 00:16:59.605
But think about flowing, clear, fresh water.

323
00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:05.095
It's appealing because it's moving.

324
00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:08.855
It doesn't grow the same level of grossness

325
00:17:08.855 --> 00:17:13.295
because it's moving, it's active, it's circulating,

326
00:17:13.395 --> 00:17:14.495
it stays fresh.

327
00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:22.475
Listen, we must not trust in ourselves

328
00:17:22.735 --> 00:17:26.395
or our past victories or our spiritual efforts.

329
00:17:26.655 --> 00:17:31.275
We must be constantly pushing forward into our relationship

330
00:17:31.545 --> 00:17:35.555
with Christ into his words, the living water

331
00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:36.915
that he promises.

332
00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:40.715
The fountain that never stops flowing,

333
00:17:40.865 --> 00:17:44.115
that never will be unsatisfying to us.

334
00:17:47.485 --> 00:17:49.145
That's the only way we'll stay growing

335
00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:50.605
in our relationship with God.

336
00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:52.805
That's the only way we'll stay vigilant against the

337
00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.765
temptation that is constantly coming our way.

338
00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.565
And so we're gonna remind ourselves a couple times today

339
00:18:02.565 --> 00:18:05.885
of the truths that I believe God brought outta this passage.

340
00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.805
And the way we're gonna remind ourselves is we're all gonna

341
00:18:08.805 --> 00:18:11.165
read out loud that point together.

342
00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:14.645
You'll notice all three points are written in first person.

343
00:18:15.555 --> 00:18:17.005
Like you will be saying that

344
00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:19.165
as if you're the one saying it, right?

345
00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:21.045
'cause you are saying it. That was confusing.

346
00:18:21.465 --> 00:18:25.565
But you'll say it from the heart.

347
00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:29.015
And and there's something about saying it and hearing it

348
00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:30.495
and reading it all together.

349
00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:33.815
It just burns it deeper into our conscience.

350
00:18:35.475 --> 00:18:37.175
So we're gonna put the point on the screen

351
00:18:37.235 --> 00:18:39.095
and we're all gonna read it out loud together.

352
00:18:39.095 --> 00:18:40.655
We're gonna do that with all the points today.

353
00:18:40.715 --> 00:18:41.895
But this one's the first.

354
00:18:42.195 --> 00:18:44.975
And so just read it, reminding yourself

355
00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:50.505
and those around you of, of this truth today.

356
00:18:53.285 --> 00:18:57.505
My hope, when tempted is not in myself.

357
00:18:58.215 --> 00:19:02.865
It's in Christ believe that,

358
00:19:04.575 --> 00:19:09.505
live that well,

359
00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:13.065
sadly, what we've learned throughout second Samuel is

360
00:19:13.065 --> 00:19:15.825
that like, you know, we're covered spiritually.

361
00:19:15.885 --> 00:19:18.785
We, we've talked about the gospel a lot during this series.

362
00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:21.945
The consequences though of sin are often very great.

363
00:19:25.545 --> 00:19:29.995
And so I want you to see the results Of David's sin here.

364
00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.955
Look at verse 10 down through verse 17.

365
00:19:37.475 --> 00:19:38.695
But David's heart struck him

366
00:19:38.695 --> 00:19:40.935
after he had numbered the people, meaning he felt convicted.

367
00:19:42.075 --> 00:19:44.895
And David said to the Lord, I have sinned greatly in

368
00:19:44.895 --> 00:19:47.405
what I've done, but now, oh Lord,

369
00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:49.245
please take away the iniquity of your servant

370
00:19:49.305 --> 00:19:51.085
for I've done very foolishly.

371
00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:54.685
And when David arose in the morning, the word

372
00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:59.165
of the Lord came to the prophet God, David seer saying, go

373
00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:00.925
and say to David, dust says the Lord.

374
00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:05.325
Three things I offer you, choose one of them

375
00:20:05.435 --> 00:20:06.485
that I may do it to you.

376
00:20:07.835 --> 00:20:09.455
So God came to David and told him

377
00:20:09.455 --> 00:20:12.855
and said to him, shall three years of famine come

378
00:20:12.855 --> 00:20:13.855
to you in their land?

379
00:20:15.165 --> 00:20:17.305
Or will you flee three months

380
00:20:17.305 --> 00:20:19.025
before your foes while they pursue you?

381
00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:24.305
Or shall there be three days pestilence or plague

382
00:20:24.305 --> 00:20:25.825
or infection in your land?

383
00:20:27.765 --> 00:20:30.385
Now consider and decide what answer I shall return

384
00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:31.825
to him who sent me.

385
00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:36.745
Then David said to God, I'm in great distress.

386
00:20:38.475 --> 00:20:40.175
Let us fall into the hand of the Lord

387
00:20:40.515 --> 00:20:41.975
for his mercy is great,

388
00:20:42.755 --> 00:20:44.695
but let me not fall into the hand of man.

389
00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:50.365
So, so the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning

390
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:51.485
until the appointed time,

391
00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:55.165
and there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba,

392
00:20:55.235 --> 00:20:57.165
70,000 men.

393
00:20:59.845 --> 00:21:02.145
And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem

394
00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:05.305
to destroy it, the Lord relented from the calamity

395
00:21:05.325 --> 00:21:07.505
and said to the angel who was working, destruction

396
00:21:07.505 --> 00:21:10.905
among the people, it's enough now stay your hand.

397
00:21:10.925 --> 00:21:13.505
And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor

398
00:21:13.765 --> 00:21:15.225
of Una, the jebusite.

399
00:21:16.645 --> 00:21:18.495
Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the

400
00:21:18.495 --> 00:21:19.575
angel who was striking the people.

401
00:21:19.595 --> 00:21:22.895
And he said, behold, I have sinned and I've done wickedly,

402
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.095
but these sheep, what have they done?

403
00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:28.785
Please let your hand be against me

404
00:21:29.085 --> 00:21:30.385
and against my father's house.

405
00:21:34.535 --> 00:21:36.235
And so again, think about what just happened.

406
00:21:36.235 --> 00:21:40.155
David sinned by pridefully numbering the soldiers,

407
00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:42.515
and God disciplined him.

408
00:21:43.255 --> 00:21:44.875
And surprisingly, this is wild.

409
00:21:44.895 --> 00:21:48.075
It it, I don't know if it ever has happened any other time,

410
00:21:48.175 --> 00:21:52.275
but God let David choose which consequence he was gonna get.

411
00:21:53.935 --> 00:21:57.555
He gave him three options, said, which one would you prefer?

412
00:21:57.855 --> 00:22:00.915
And all bad, but which one would you prefer?

413
00:22:00.935 --> 00:22:03.195
And David felt the pain of his sin in his heart.

414
00:22:03.195 --> 00:22:05.715
And he said in verse 14, let us fall into the hands

415
00:22:05.915 --> 00:22:07.595
of the Lord for his mercy is great.

416
00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:09.955
Don't let us fall into the hands of men.

417
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:12.195
Meaning, I don't wanna be chased around.

418
00:22:12.235 --> 00:22:13.555
I don't wanna be in battle anymore.

419
00:22:14.415 --> 00:22:16.595
God, I I'm just giving myself to you.

420
00:22:17.455 --> 00:22:19.035
And we'll come back to that again later.

421
00:22:19.095 --> 00:22:22.715
But notice here, he chose that his mercy is great.

422
00:22:22.735 --> 00:22:25.035
He chose that. He says, I believe God's merciful.

423
00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:29.715
But notice that even in the hands of this merciful God,

424
00:22:29.885 --> 00:22:33.435
there was a deep pain experienced both by David

425
00:22:34.295 --> 00:22:35.355
and by the people.

426
00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:41.145
You think back to David's sin, with Bathsheba.

427
00:22:41.145 --> 00:22:45.785
With Uriah, that whole thing there, that cost five lives,

428
00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:53.525
this sin driven by pride and self-reliance.

429
00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:56.445
It costs 70,000 lives.

430
00:22:59.235 --> 00:23:01.125
Like let that number pierce your soul.

431
00:23:04.895 --> 00:23:07.785
70,000 fathers sons, brothers,

432
00:23:09.885 --> 00:23:13.745
all dead because a godly man gave in to temptation.

433
00:23:17.385 --> 00:23:19.005
And I know some of you're sitting there thinking like

434
00:23:19.005 --> 00:23:20.005
that doesn't, that's not fair.

435
00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:26.065
What do those guys do? 70,000 families wrecked by this.

436
00:23:26.065 --> 00:23:27.705
Like what? And it's hard, I know.

437
00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:29.305
But don't let the enemy deceive you

438
00:23:29.305 --> 00:23:30.665
or distract you in this moment.

439
00:23:30.965 --> 00:23:34.705
The reality is our sins are never private.

440
00:23:39.395 --> 00:23:42.295
You think about throwing a rock into a pond, right?

441
00:23:42.515 --> 00:23:46.405
The ripples go out all the way to the edges of the pond.

442
00:23:52.225 --> 00:23:53.795
Well, it seems here in verse 17

443
00:23:53.795 --> 00:23:55.315
that David finally recognized the

444
00:23:55.315 --> 00:23:56.435
horror of what he had done.

445
00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:58.875
He'd saw this effect and he said, I've sinned.

446
00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:01.075
I've done wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done?

447
00:24:01.705 --> 00:24:04.195
This is part of the agony of repentance.

448
00:24:07.305 --> 00:24:09.805
You recognize what you've done and you turn from it

449
00:24:09.805 --> 00:24:10.805
and you turn back to God.

450
00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:14.965
But part of the pain of it is recognizing that our sin

451
00:24:15.635 --> 00:24:17.725
doesn't just wound us.

452
00:24:19.855 --> 00:24:22.595
It affects others. It hurts others. It wounds others.

453
00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:23.875
It grieves God.

454
00:24:24.135 --> 00:24:28.155
It brings about destruction in our world and in our lives

455
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.195
and our families.

456
00:24:29.215 --> 00:24:32.355
Our sin is never just about us.

457
00:24:35.885 --> 00:24:37.785
That's the point we need to be reminded of today.

458
00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:41.265
Friends like so clearly this does so strongly, this does.

459
00:24:41.415 --> 00:24:45.945
It's that sin will cost me more than I could ever imagine.

460
00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:49.945
I mean, this has been a summary of the entire book.

461
00:24:49.945 --> 00:24:53.945
In many ways, sin will cost you far more

462
00:24:55.415 --> 00:24:56.505
than you can ever imagine.

463
00:25:02.325 --> 00:25:06.955
David could not have imagined what his sin against Bathsheba

464
00:25:07.055 --> 00:25:10.555
and Uriah would bring about in his family and in his nation.

465
00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:17.785
There's no way he could have foreseen the high cost

466
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:20.225
of boasting about his army size.

467
00:25:26.185 --> 00:25:27.475
It's probably the same for you, isn't it?

468
00:25:30.085 --> 00:25:31.655
Like you look back at your life

469
00:25:34.085 --> 00:25:38.025
and you see the carnage of the choices you've made and sin

470
00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:41.785
and you've, you've seen the effects of sin in your life

471
00:25:41.805 --> 00:25:42.905
and in those around you.

472
00:25:42.925 --> 00:25:44.585
And listen, you look back on those things

473
00:25:44.605 --> 00:25:45.985
and if you see that pain

474
00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:49.385
and sorrow, I'm guessing that you would go back

475
00:25:49.645 --> 00:25:51.825
and wouldn't do the same thing again, right?

476
00:25:55.855 --> 00:25:58.025
Like if you had a choice, if you could see it,

477
00:25:58.085 --> 00:26:02.745
my guess is if you'd have known what comes from that sin,

478
00:26:02.775 --> 00:26:04.985
that thought, that action, whatever it was,

479
00:26:05.165 --> 00:26:06.585
you probably wouldn't have done it.

480
00:26:11.145 --> 00:26:15.845
But here, man, here we discover one of the enemy's

481
00:26:16.355 --> 00:26:18.085
main attacks against us.

482
00:26:20.775 --> 00:26:22.565
Let's put ourselves back on the front end

483
00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:23.725
before we've sinned.

484
00:26:23.775 --> 00:26:27.825
We're in the fog of temptation. Like we, we all feel that.

485
00:26:27.825 --> 00:26:28.825
We all know what that feels like.

486
00:26:28.825 --> 00:26:31.265
You're in the fog of temptation. It's hard to see anything.

487
00:26:31.605 --> 00:26:33.985
All you know is this temptation's coming your way.

488
00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:38.665
And he, the enemy, makes it hard to see

489
00:26:38.895 --> 00:26:41.825
that there will be any consequences on the other side

490
00:26:41.825 --> 00:26:44.665
of doing that thing, right?

491
00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:47.225
He makes it seem, I'm just give you a couple examples.

492
00:26:47.365 --> 00:26:49.625
He makes it seem like, man, you're, you're fine.

493
00:26:49.695 --> 00:26:51.305
This isn't gonna hurt anyone else.

494
00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:52.945
Let me just give you some examples.

495
00:26:57.315 --> 00:27:00.095
He lies to you and gets you to believe that

496
00:27:00.095 --> 00:27:01.335
what you're doing, you're just chatting with

497
00:27:01.335 --> 00:27:03.015
that woman online, it's not a big deal.

498
00:27:03.015 --> 00:27:05.815
Nobody's gonna find out until it destroys your family.

499
00:27:11.315 --> 00:27:15.945
You, He, he gets you to rationalize that purchase

500
00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:18.345
or to go into debt like that because you deserve it or

501
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:21.425
because God wants you to enjoy life failing

502
00:27:21.525 --> 00:27:25.545
to acknowledge the growing financial bondage

503
00:27:25.575 --> 00:27:26.945
that will limit generosity

504
00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.385
and cause undue stress in your life.

505
00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:32.425
'cause you, you needed it. You deserve it.

506
00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:39.615
He deceives you into thinking that it's just a few drinks

507
00:27:42.335 --> 00:27:45.525
until you get behind the wheel and end up in prison.

508
00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:48.245
Or worse, you end someone's life.

509
00:27:52.885 --> 00:27:55.785
He dangles that a in front of you

510
00:27:57.605 --> 00:28:00.415
that you would get if you just cheat like everybody else is.

511
00:28:03.985 --> 00:28:06.245
But you fail to see the, the cost that could be

512
00:28:06.245 --> 00:28:08.605
of losing a scholarship or getting kicked outta school.

513
00:28:14.185 --> 00:28:17.085
You, you think it's just a few videos or I'm just scrolling

514
00:28:17.105 --> 00:28:19.565
and I'm just kind of relaxing a little bit.

515
00:28:19.585 --> 00:28:20.685
But you fail to realize

516
00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:25.645
how it is desensitizing your conscience, feeding discontent

517
00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:28.925
and stealing time from deeper relationships.

518
00:28:33.455 --> 00:28:36.665
Like this is why church, this is why we must be vigilant

519
00:28:36.775 --> 00:28:39.625
because the devil and the world

520
00:28:39.805 --> 00:28:42.825
and even your flesh are constantly working

521
00:28:43.205 --> 00:28:47.425
to pull you away from God, shoving

522
00:28:47.975 --> 00:28:50.865
sins, potential effects under the rug, getting you

523
00:28:51.045 --> 00:28:52.545
to not look at those.

524
00:28:52.835 --> 00:28:54.745
Don't worry about it. Just feed your flesh right now.

525
00:28:54.815 --> 00:28:57.225
Just satisfy that desire right now. That's what you need.

526
00:28:57.275 --> 00:28:59.225
Don't worry about that. That's not really gonna happen.

527
00:28:59.645 --> 00:29:01.625
It is all a lie.

528
00:29:02.395 --> 00:29:03.745
Again, if you were able

529
00:29:03.845 --> 00:29:06.665
to see the consequences on the other side of

530
00:29:06.665 --> 00:29:10.065
what you're choosing to do in the moment, you would much

531
00:29:10.575 --> 00:29:12.225
less likely do that.

532
00:29:12.225 --> 00:29:16.945
Same thing. If I knew the cost

533
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.385
of what I'm about to do

534
00:29:18.685 --> 00:29:21.065
and I could see the effect on the other side,

535
00:29:21.345 --> 00:29:24.145
I would be a lot less likely to do what I'm about to do.

536
00:29:25.875 --> 00:29:28.285
It's not the only reason we don't sin, right?

537
00:29:28.345 --> 00:29:31.045
Our first priority is that we love God enough.

538
00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:33.045
But this is a really good barrier too.

539
00:29:34.425 --> 00:29:37.805
It helps us down the road to holiness.

540
00:29:39.765 --> 00:29:42.165
And so similar to, we did the first one.

541
00:29:43.195 --> 00:29:45.845
This is another truth. We need to keep pounding

542
00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:50.245
into our souls to learn it, to remember it, to live by it.

543
00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:51.325
We have to remember this.

544
00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:53.605
So we're gonna read this one out loud as well.

545
00:29:54.795 --> 00:29:58.485
Read it again with the idea to teach yourself.

546
00:29:58.505 --> 00:30:02.245
Remind yourself of these truths. Here's the second point.

547
00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:07.645
Sin will cost me more than I could ever imagine.

548
00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:11.675
Remember that.

549
00:30:16.535 --> 00:30:18.475
Now we come to the end of Second Samuel

550
00:30:18.575 --> 00:30:21.835
and May, it feels pretty tragic, doesn't it?

551
00:30:23.925 --> 00:30:28.315
In many ways it is. But I wanna see

552
00:30:29.025 --> 00:30:30.075
just a couple things.

553
00:30:30.085 --> 00:30:31.915
David said here in this passage,

554
00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:40.115
he was convicted in his heart over

555
00:30:40.115 --> 00:30:41.595
what he'd done in verse 10.

556
00:30:41.615 --> 00:30:44.915
He said, I've sinned greatly in what I've done.

557
00:30:45.985 --> 00:30:47.915
Take away the iniquity of your servant.

558
00:30:48.385 --> 00:30:52.235
I've acted foolishly. He's recognizing, man, I'm off.

559
00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:54.435
I I didn't do this. I blew it.

560
00:30:55.705 --> 00:30:58.495
Verse 14, he calls upon the great mercy of God, verse

561
00:30:59.135 --> 00:31:00.295
17, I've sinned.

562
00:31:00.295 --> 00:31:03.415
I've done wickedly. Let your hand be against me, not them.

563
00:31:03.415 --> 00:31:05.935
Like I should take ownership. I am owning this.

564
00:31:06.215 --> 00:31:07.415
I messed up God.

565
00:31:10.555 --> 00:31:11.895
And then watch what he does next.

566
00:31:11.895 --> 00:31:14.695
This is verses 18 through the very end of the chapter.

567
00:31:14.745 --> 00:31:18.495
Watch this. And Gad came that day to David

568
00:31:18.555 --> 00:31:20.895
and said to him, go up, raise Antar

569
00:31:21.075 --> 00:31:25.095
to the Lord on the threshing floor of Aruna, the Jebusite.

570
00:31:25.095 --> 00:31:27.575
We had already seen that a few verses earlier.

571
00:31:29.275 --> 00:31:32.015
So David went up at God's word as the Lord commanded.

572
00:31:33.155 --> 00:31:34.885
When Aruna looked down, he saw the king

573
00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:36.125
and his servants coming on toward him.

574
00:31:36.305 --> 00:31:38.605
And Aruna went out and paid homage to the king with his face

575
00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:42.005
to the ground and said, why is my Lord the king?

576
00:31:42.005 --> 00:31:45.245
Come to his servant. And David said,

577
00:31:45.345 --> 00:31:47.605
to buy the threshing floor from you in order

578
00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:48.885
to build an altar to the Lord

579
00:31:49.155 --> 00:31:51.805
that the plague may be averted from the people.

580
00:31:54.035 --> 00:31:55.085
Then Aruna said to David,

581
00:31:55.145 --> 00:31:56.965
let my Lord the king take an offer up.

582
00:31:56.965 --> 00:31:58.045
What seems good to him?

583
00:31:58.145 --> 00:31:59.765
Here's the oxen for the burnt offering.

584
00:31:59.765 --> 00:32:02.205
The threshing sludges, the yolks of the oxen for the wood.

585
00:32:02.465 --> 00:32:04.645
All this una gives to the king.

586
00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:08.645
Una said to the king, may the Lord your God accept you.

587
00:32:08.825 --> 00:32:13.725
But the king said to Una, no, but I will buy it from you.

588
00:32:14.425 --> 00:32:16.965
And for a price I love this.

589
00:32:17.245 --> 00:32:20.165
I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God,

590
00:32:20.165 --> 00:32:21.325
that cost me nothing.

591
00:32:23.695 --> 00:32:25.195
So David bought the threshing floor

592
00:32:25.195 --> 00:32:27.155
and the oxen for 50 shekels of silver.

593
00:32:27.495 --> 00:32:29.675
And David built there analar to the Lord

594
00:32:29.695 --> 00:32:32.275
and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

595
00:32:32.495 --> 00:32:34.915
And the Lord responded to the plea for the land,

596
00:32:35.135 --> 00:32:38.195
and the plague was averted from Israel.

597
00:32:41.675 --> 00:32:44.975
As dark as this conclusion has been,

598
00:32:45.725 --> 00:32:49.415
this is the breathtaking grace that shines through it.

599
00:32:51.575 --> 00:32:55.965
Watch this. David had learned

600
00:32:56.855 --> 00:32:59.765
where to run when he failed.

601
00:33:01.635 --> 00:33:04.615
He had learned he shouldn't run to military strength.

602
00:33:04.915 --> 00:33:07.495
He shouldn't run to political alliances.

603
00:33:07.635 --> 00:33:09.095
He shouldn't run to try

604
00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:12.615
to cover up his sin like he did the first time with Uriah.

605
00:33:12.835 --> 00:33:15.495
He shouldn't try to run to any of those things.

606
00:33:15.675 --> 00:33:20.055
He had learned he he should throw himself on

607
00:33:20.055 --> 00:33:21.095
the mercy of God.

608
00:33:24.255 --> 00:33:28.635
And so what he does here, he, he builds an altar. Why?

609
00:33:29.015 --> 00:33:32.875
To stay the hand of God's judgment against his people

610
00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:36.315
to stop it, to say, there's gotta be a way

611
00:33:36.415 --> 00:33:37.515
for this not to continue.

612
00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:38.835
Because it was continuing

613
00:33:38.905 --> 00:33:41.315
that angel was standing there with the judgment.

614
00:33:41.535 --> 00:33:42.995
He was doing the work.

615
00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:45.595
And David's like, we gotta stop this somehow.

616
00:33:47.335 --> 00:33:50.515
So he built an altar, he offered sacrifices,

617
00:33:50.655 --> 00:33:53.755
and he turned back to God in repentance and worship.

618
00:33:54.695 --> 00:33:58.995
And what happened? God stopped.

619
00:33:59.805 --> 00:34:01.795
Those two things were happening concurrently.

620
00:34:01.795 --> 00:34:06.195
What God said to the angel, he said, at the same time, David

621
00:34:06.895 --> 00:34:08.515
was doing what he was doing with the altar,

622
00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:15.005
and this is why we can't skim over the details in the

623
00:34:15.005 --> 00:34:18.885
Bible, this threshing floor.

624
00:34:18.885 --> 00:34:20.085
It's like, well, okay, what in the world?

625
00:34:20.085 --> 00:34:24.605
Why is this matter? Well, this threshing floor

626
00:34:24.605 --> 00:34:29.415
of Aruna, the place where judgment stopped

627
00:34:32.435 --> 00:34:36.645
a few chapters later became the site of the temple.

628
00:34:39.605 --> 00:34:41.585
It was the very location that Solomon,

629
00:34:41.585 --> 00:34:45.025
a few years later built the temple on

630
00:34:45.055 --> 00:34:46.945
that very spot.

631
00:34:47.165 --> 00:34:51.025
It became the place where God would meet

632
00:34:51.295 --> 00:34:54.425
with his people for centuries to come.

633
00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:59.025
The place where sacrifices were made to cover people's sin.

634
00:34:59.285 --> 00:35:03.825
So even in the discipline that's happening in two Samuel 24,

635
00:35:04.405 --> 00:35:09.105
God was working redemption, even in the judgment.

636
00:35:10.055 --> 00:35:11.585
He's preparing the way for grace,

637
00:35:14.235 --> 00:35:16.325
that threshing floor became holy ground

638
00:35:16.325 --> 00:35:20.245
because David met God there in brokenness, in faith.

639
00:35:20.545 --> 00:35:24.725
And the offerings given were what covered David's sin.

640
00:35:24.985 --> 00:35:28.485
The place of judgment became the place

641
00:35:28.975 --> 00:35:30.405
mercy came from.

642
00:35:33.595 --> 00:35:34.855
You see some parallels here.

643
00:35:38.675 --> 00:35:43.385
David knew Mercy was available if he came to Yahweh,

644
00:35:43.385 --> 00:35:45.345
if he came to God.

645
00:35:45.685 --> 00:35:46.985
The same truth for us.

646
00:35:47.435 --> 00:35:52.305
Mercy is available for us if we return to Christ.

647
00:35:56.645 --> 00:36:01.475
Mercy is available if I return to Christ.

648
00:36:02.955 --> 00:36:05.095
Here's how all this parallels for us today.

649
00:36:08.225 --> 00:36:12.965
Christian, Listen, you are going to sin.

650
00:36:14.765 --> 00:36:16.705
We shouldn't want to. We shouldn't try to,

651
00:36:17.045 --> 00:36:20.265
but you are going to, until Jesus comes back

652
00:36:20.445 --> 00:36:24.665
or until you die, at some point you are going to sin again.

653
00:36:26.205 --> 00:36:30.425
And so when you do, don't run from him.

654
00:36:31.765 --> 00:36:35.855
Run to him. Don't run away from God. Run to him. Why?

655
00:36:35.855 --> 00:36:37.935
Because his mercies are so great.

656
00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:39.975
You can fall on the mercies of God

657
00:36:39.975 --> 00:36:43.255
because you know Christ has born the judgment

658
00:36:43.485 --> 00:36:45.215
that you deserve for your sin.

659
00:36:45.395 --> 00:36:49.735
He has become the sufficient offering to cover all

660
00:36:50.035 --> 00:36:51.575
of your sin.

661
00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:53.575
That's the reality of that threshing floor.

662
00:36:53.635 --> 00:36:55.295
Be becoming the place of mercy.

663
00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:58.215
The reality here is that the plague

664
00:36:58.435 --> 00:37:00.655
of spiritual death was coming for you.

665
00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:05.645
The judgment of God is on you and me.

666
00:37:05.775 --> 00:37:07.005
Apart from any intervention,

667
00:37:07.305 --> 00:37:09.565
we are sinners deserving of God's wrath.

668
00:37:09.825 --> 00:37:12.885
The plague of spiritual death was coming for you.

669
00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:17.845
Yet the spiritual beauty is that the shed blood of Christ is

670
00:37:17.845 --> 00:37:20.525
what cleanses you from all of that sin.

671
00:37:20.785 --> 00:37:23.605
The judgment has been taken for you.

672
00:37:23.825 --> 00:37:25.765
And so it wasn't a threshing floor anymore.

673
00:37:25.945 --> 00:37:28.165
It was a hill with a cross planted on it

674
00:37:28.175 --> 00:37:30.405
where the judgment became the place

675
00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:32.085
of mercy for you and for me.

676
00:37:34.505 --> 00:37:36.965
That's why you don't have to run away from him anymore.

677
00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:39.805
You can run to him when you sin.

678
00:37:41.205 --> 00:37:44.145
You can repent, you can worship and you can watch.

679
00:37:44.525 --> 00:37:46.345
As God transforms the place

680
00:37:46.565 --> 00:37:50.825
of your failure into the very place where his presence meets

681
00:37:51.015 --> 00:37:55.995
with you, you become

682
00:37:55.995 --> 00:38:00.265
his temple where the sacrifices have already been paid

683
00:38:00.325 --> 00:38:04.305
by Jesus' blood and his presence fills you just like he

684
00:38:04.305 --> 00:38:09.095
filled the temple back then judgment becomes mercy.

685
00:38:12.095 --> 00:38:13.995
So I invite the worship leaders to come back out now and,

686
00:38:14.055 --> 00:38:17.635
and, and we're gonna repeat that point in worship.

687
00:38:18.725 --> 00:38:21.915
We're gonna repeat that same point, that third point

688
00:38:21.915 --> 00:38:25.595
with a spirit of joy and humility and gratitude

689
00:38:25.895 --> 00:38:29.395
and awe with this idea of all that we've seen,

690
00:38:29.395 --> 00:38:30.515
the judgment turning to mercy.

691
00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:34.595
We've seen it. And let's remind ourselves, remind each other

692
00:38:34.775 --> 00:38:35.805
of that truth.

693
00:38:36.025 --> 00:38:37.885
So here we go. It's gonna be up on the screen.

694
00:38:37.985 --> 00:38:40.485
You'll see it. Mercy is available.

695
00:38:40.865 --> 00:38:43.445
If I return to Christ, we can do better than that.

696
00:38:43.735 --> 00:38:47.765
Mercy is available if I return to Christ.

697
00:38:48.255 --> 00:38:49.765
Let's believe that. Let's say it again.

698
00:38:50.055 --> 00:38:54.845
Mercy is available if I return to Christ.

699
00:38:55.145 --> 00:38:59.805
That's for you. That's for you, friend.

700
00:39:02.755 --> 00:39:04.795
I don't know what you've done. He does.

701
00:39:09.825 --> 00:39:10.445
And you know what?

702
00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:19.125
He paid for it. He's provided for it.

703
00:39:21.105 --> 00:39:23.165
And so the invitation today is to run to him.

704
00:39:24.875 --> 00:39:26.125
Mercy's available. If I return

705
00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:27.485
to Christ, it's available for you.

706
00:39:27.705 --> 00:39:29.805
Return to him. Run to him like David.

707
00:39:30.345 --> 00:39:34.245
Run to the mercy seat. Run to the altar of Christ.

708
00:39:37.825 --> 00:39:39.485
The very definition of mercy

709
00:39:39.585 --> 00:39:41.725
and grace is that you don't deserve it.

710
00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:45.085
So don't feel like you're too far gone. Don't feel like you.

711
00:39:45.345 --> 00:39:47.725
You can't earn it because you can't earn it.

712
00:39:49.585 --> 00:39:53.405
He earned it for you. That's the beauty of the gospel.

713
00:39:56.315 --> 00:40:00.285
It's hope Mercy is available if I return to Christ.

714
00:40:00.305 --> 00:40:02.365
And so we're gonna have our prayer partners along the

715
00:40:02.365 --> 00:40:03.405
walls in this room.

716
00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:05.325
If you need to talk to someone, if you're in that place

717
00:40:05.325 --> 00:40:07.205
and you're like, I, I don't know what to do with this,

718
00:40:07.385 --> 00:40:10.085
and you're so broken and you just tears, it's okay.

719
00:40:11.555 --> 00:40:12.765
Mercy's available. If you return

720
00:40:12.765 --> 00:40:13.965
to Christ, they're not Christ.

721
00:40:13.965 --> 00:40:16.285
They're gonna help you towards him.

722
00:40:16.395 --> 00:40:18.045
They're gonna pray for you're gonna encourage you.

723
00:40:18.105 --> 00:40:19.605
Or maybe it's not that. Maybe it is.

724
00:40:19.605 --> 00:40:21.845
This place up here is open all the time.

725
00:40:21.945 --> 00:40:24.445
And you just say, I just, I just need to symbolize

726
00:40:24.445 --> 00:40:28.285
to myself this idea of running to the altar of Christ

727
00:40:29.345 --> 00:40:32.045
or right at your seat, face down whatever it is that you're,

728
00:40:32.045 --> 00:40:35.405
you're in your heart saying, Jesus, I need you.

729
00:40:35.465 --> 00:40:36.485
You're repenting.

730
00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:37.965
And whatever the cost,

731
00:40:38.195 --> 00:40:41.885
your sin is demanded in your life, Mercy's available.

732
00:40:43.955 --> 00:40:47.005
Doesn't mean life will be perfect like it was before.

733
00:40:47.585 --> 00:40:50.405
But mercy eternally is available

734
00:40:50.905 --> 00:40:52.165
for those who return to Christ.

735
00:40:52.665 --> 00:40:55.685
So run to him. Run to him in temptation

736
00:40:55.685 --> 00:40:56.725
before you even do it.

737
00:40:56.905 --> 00:40:59.405
Run to him. Hope in him. He's your hope. Run to him.

738
00:40:59.515 --> 00:41:02.485
Look to the lamb who died for your sin.

739
00:41:02.905 --> 00:41:06.365
Run to him today and find mercy

740
00:41:06.625 --> 00:41:08.005
and grace in your time of need.

741
00:41:09.865 --> 00:41:10.085
Um.
