1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
Good morning church. It's such an

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.600
honor to be with you guys here today. My name is Brandon for

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.400
those who you those of you who do not know me and I get to serve

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.100
as the boys Ministry associate and so I get to hang

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.600
out with all the students and in such a pleasure and

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.100
a delight and as I'm up here, I do want

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.200
to take a second to thank our students. Thank

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.600
all of the students in here for just

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.600
how easy and how fun. They make my job whether it

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.600
is going to Sky Zone and going crazy

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200
or whether we are going to Saint Louis together.

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.800
Or even going the Saint Louis and doing

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.400
King of the Beach.

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.500
And playing stick for all

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.900
hours and playing nine square as well. I want

16
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.600
to thank you guys for making my job so easy and

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.300
so to the parents and all the leaders in

18
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.600
here who support us and and give and

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.500
do all these things. And so we really appreciate everything and

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.100
trusting us with your students.

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.600
And so I got to Henderson Hills in 2020. I

22
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.200
started off as an intern and pretty much

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
I was here and then I took my

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.800
time at UCO and I recently graduated back in 2022. And

25
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.500
so as I transitioned into this full-time

26
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
role, I figured okay. What is

27
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.300
something I can do to just you know, make my life more difficult.

28
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500
And one thing I landed on was okay. I'll start I'll

29
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.700
start Seminary and before you check out and just

30
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.800
say okay, he's gonna have these fancy Seminary words

31
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.500
and on and on and on he goes that's not

32
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
it at all. I am far from the poster Seminary

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.100
students and you'll find out why in a

34
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.900
little bit but I started Seminary August 1st, and I

35
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.700
do Southern online and so they offer eight

36
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.300
week blocks and so a whole 16 weeks of information

37
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.200
is crammed down into eight weeks. It's great.

38
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.100
It's truly awesome. So I started in

39
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.500
August and it was great. The workload wasn't too

40
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.100
bad. I was taking Carmen nudics, which is basically just

41
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.200
the interpretation of the Bible and learning all these cool tricks.

42
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.600
Very simple simple stuff and first

43
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.400
eight weeks were awesome student Ministry was great. We

44
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.600
didn't have a lot going on in particular. I'm just

45
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.100
Wednesday nights and casually seeing students and caring for

46
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.100
them when we got the chance.

47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.100
And I loved it truly.

48
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
And then we got a week off, which is great. I enjoyed the week off

49
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.700
and then I started

50
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.500
another eight weeks

51
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.400
and this day weeks was intro to Old Testament one

52
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.100
recovering Genesis through Esther and eight weeks

53
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.400
and the workload was truly unlike anything

54
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.100
I've seen before.

55
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
And on top of that student Ministry life is getting

56
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.100
busier and crazier. We're planning for United conferences. It

57
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.900
all really good stuff.

58
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.500
But I got busy.

59
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.500
And it got hard.

60
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.400
And so we're here.

61
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.400
And week eight of eight.

62
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.300
It's finals week.

63
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200
Yeah tomorrow. Yeah to everything is due tomorrow.

64
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.400
Yes, and I didn't mention this

65
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.400
but I did so it schools in Kentucky which basically

66
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.100
means that everything is on East Coast

67
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.600
time. And so I'm already in our behind on everything I

68
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.800
do.

69
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.100
and so

70
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.500
it's been hard.

71
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.400
I've been tired.

72
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.200
It's been a hard semester Hard Eight Weeks.

73
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.800
and so

74
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.500
I'm up here during finals week getting ready

75
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.300
for this Sunday in the midst of Thanksgiving.

76
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.700
And as you can guess not everything is done. I still

77
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.100
have more work to do whenever this is over.

78
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.600
And some of you may be feeling that anxiety from your

79
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.900
seats.

80
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.300
You can you can see okay, he's in trouble. We've all

81
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.700
been there.

82
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.700
And you can see where I'm coming from.

83
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.400
And I want to ask you guys the question.

84
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.300
I wonder if anyone else in here.

85
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.100
Has felt that way.

86
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.200
I wonder if anyone else in here has been feeling just the pressure

87
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.500
and weight of Life recently.

88
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.600
with Thanksgiving around us

89
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.100
the pressure to make everything perfect.

90
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.100
And to put on a successful Thanksgiving for all your family. I wonder

91
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.300
if that weighed on your soul.

92
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.300
And as I get older I start to see that Thanksgiving is

93
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.500
actually a pretty hard holiday for a lot of people for a

94
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.100
lot of different reasons.

95
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.400
And I wonder if you've been wrestling with that same thing this past

96
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.600
weekend.

97
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.000
and if so

98
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.300
I want to invite you to join me.

99
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.100
In just this tiredness this sense of

100
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.400
fatigue.

101
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.500
And this isn't a Pity Club where we just feel bad for ourselves.

102
00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.600
but this morning

103
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.300
I want us to all leave feeling refreshed.

104
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.600
I want us to all see the faithfulness of God.

105
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.600
I want to see how God speaks into our

106
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.800
lives.

107
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.500
To yell your Bibles. Go ahead and turn with me to Psalm 52.

108
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.900
Be towards the middle-ish of your Bible.

109
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.000
So, let's see what the Lord has for us today in Psalm 52.

110
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.100
To the choir master. I'm a skill

111
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.100
of David. When do AG the adamites came and told Saul

112
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.900
David has come to the house of amalek.

113
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.400
Why do you boast of evil Almighty man?

114
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.000
the steadfast love of God endures all the

115
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.200
day

116
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.000
your tongue plots destruction

117
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.000
like a sharp razor you worker of Deceit.

118
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.300
You love evil more than good.

119
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.300
And lying more than speaking what is right.

120
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.400
You love all words that devour.

121
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.600
Oh deceitful tongue.

122
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.100
But God will break you down forever.

123
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.900
He will snatch and tear you from your tents.

124
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.100
He will uproot you from the lands of the living.

125
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.000
The righteous shall see and fear.

126
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.400
and shall laugh at him saying

127
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.800
see the man who would not make God his Refuge but trusted

128
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.500
in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge

129
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.400
in his own destruction.

130
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.100
But I am like a green olive tree in the

131
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.900
house of God.

132
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.100
I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.

133
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.900
I will thank you forever because you

134
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.600
have done it.

135
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.800
I will wait for your name for it is good in the

136
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.000
presence of The Godly. Let me

137
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.300
pray for us dear Lord. We thank you for this time.

138
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.400
And we thank you that you are good.

139
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.000
Lord we thank you that you are faithful.

140
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.300
God would you open our eyes this morning to help us truly? See

141
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.500
that your name we pray amen.

142
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.100
and so the beautiful thing about Psalms is

143
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.200
these Psalms all 150 of them. They come

144
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.300
out of real life. They weren't written in

145
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.500
isolation for us to just stick on the fridge

146
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.700
or something. But no these Psalms originated from

147
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.900
real life situations.

148
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.300
And Laura was very kind with this chapter of Psalms and we see a

149
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.900
title that helps us understand the context.

150
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.400
And so as we read Psalm 52, we can actually take a peek

151
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.300
behind the scenes of what's really going on in the life

152
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.600
of David.

153
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.200
And so which means we need to capitalize on this

154
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.700
context.

155
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.300
We need to see what sparked this writing.

156
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.100
And so you have a bookmark or you can put your finger we're gonna

157
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.300
pause right here in Psalm 52 and we're gonna turn back.

158
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.900
So first Samuel chapter 20, it'll be

159
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.300
a couple books over.

160
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.200
First Samuel chapter 20, we'll also have the verses on the screen as well.

161
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.700
And as you're turning there a quick quick backstory just so

162
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.700
you kind of know where we're jumping in. So Saul is

163
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.300
King at this time.

164
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.300
But David has also been anointed king. So, this

165
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.900
is Forrest David to live on the run because Saul has pretty

166
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.500
much just lost.

167
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:35.800
his mind

168
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.000
in first Samuel 20 verse 30 we can see what's going on

169
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.000
in Saul's head.

170
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.200
This is his mindset. This is Saul talking

171
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.300
to his son Jonathan.

172
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.700
The insults anger was kindled against Jonathan and

173
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.000
he said to him you son of a perverse rebellious

174
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.300
woman.

175
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.600
Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse meaning

176
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.800
David to your own shame?

177
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.500
Into the shame of your mother's necklace.

178
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.800
For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth neither you

179
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.800
nor your kingdom shall be established.

180
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.900
Therefore send and bring him to me for he shall surely die.

181
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.900
As you can imagine David does not feel safe in his home anymore.

182
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.400
But if we keep reading through first Samuel Saul doesn't stop there with

183
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.700
these thoughts of Vengeance and Wrath.

184
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.400
It's also send spies to scope out where David might

185
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.500
be.

186
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.000
One of those spies is dog.

187
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.500
the atomite who appears in a title of Psalm

188
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:37.800
52

189
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.700
and so once David has been discovered.

190
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.000
Doak runs back to Saul to tell him

191
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.600
I don't know what Saul has promised these men, but

192
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.900
I can only imagine the reward would be great for capturing

193
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.600
David and securing Saul's Kingdom.

194
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.800
And if we put ourself in the shoes of doughag.

195
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.000
We can just imagine the excitement he had.

196
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.300
He's got a story itself. He's got something to say

197
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.800
everyone's wondering where David is and he found them he's

198
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.100
walking back in the saw.

199
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.300
chest puffed up ready to ride out

200
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:13.500
David

201
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.800
in the first Samuel 22

202
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.700
We see this.

203
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.600
This scene take place.

204
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.400
22 verse 6

205
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.300
Now saw heard that David was discovered.

206
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.600
And the man who were with him?

207
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.600
Saul was sitting yet give you

208
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.500
under the Tamaris tree

209
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.100
on the height with his spear in his hand

210
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.000
and all his servants were standing about him.

211
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.700
And so we see this scene a saw

212
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.100
with a spirit in his hand ready to kill someone.

213
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.300
His men surrounding him.

214
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.000
And we keep reading.

215
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.300
And Saul said to his servants who stood about him.

216
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.600
here now people have Benjamin

217
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.600
Well the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and

218
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.000
Vineyards.

219
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.100
Will he make you all commanders of thousands and

220
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.100
commanders of hundreds?

221
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.500
So Saul is now trying to bribe his men and entice

222
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.200
them. Hey David cannot give

223
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.600
you what I can give you I can give you everything you want.

224
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.200
to continue

225
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.400
then doe AG.

226
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.600
the adamite who stood by the Servants of Saul said

227
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.300
I saw this on to Jesse coming to Knob.

228
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.000
to amalek

229
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.200
the son of attitude and he inquired of

230
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.600
the Lord for him and gave him provisions and gave

231
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.100
him the sword of Goliath the philistine.

232
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.700
And so the text tells us what do I says?

233
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.000
But I mean do I just had to burst out with this

234
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.300
information about David?

235
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.500
and so once Saul knows

236
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.300
where David is he has to do something obviously.

237
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.400
So Saul summons the priests who helped hide David and

238
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.400
care for him.

239
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.200
And we see their dialogue a couple verses down picking up

240
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.800
in verse 13.

241
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.900
And Saul said to him.

242
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.800
Why have you conspired against me?

243
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.800
You and the son of Jesse.

244
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.600
And that you have given him bread and a sword

245
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600
and have inquired of God for him.

246
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.300
That he has risen against me to lie in wait as

247
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:25.900
at this day.

248
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.700
in the king says

249
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.500
you shall surely die amalek.

250
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.600
You and all your father's house.

251
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.900
And the King said to the guard who stood about him.

252
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.900
Turn and kill the priests of the Lord.

253
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.000
Because their hand is also with David.

254
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.300
And they knew that he fled and did not disclose it

255
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.400
to me.

256
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.500
But the Servants of the king would not put out their hands to strike

257
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.200
the priests of the Lord.

258
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.500
And the King said the dog?

259
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.900
You turn instructive priests.

260
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.200
In dog datamite turned and struck

261
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.000
down the priests.

262
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.200
And he killed on that day 85 persons who were

263
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.700
the landed opod and sonob the City of priests he

264
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.900
put to the sword both man and woman child

265
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.000
and infants Ox donkey sheep.

266
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.700
He put to the sword.

267
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.000
We see this evil going on.

268
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.000
We see everything that David sees.

269
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.400
David is seeing these men chased after him.

270
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.200
David convinces these priests to help him to feed him

271
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.800
so he can live.

272
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.900
Now these priests are dead.

273
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.900
David has seen how King Saul has lost his mind.

274
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.400
David sees all this evil.

275
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.100
around him

276
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.600
and even though Saul is in direct opposition

277
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.200
to the Lord.

278
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.500
By attacking his anointed David.

279
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.300
Enforcing David to live on the Run.

280
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.200
How does David respond?

281
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.100
If we go back to Psalm 52.

282
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.300
We see his response.

283
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.000
The first four verses David is asking

284
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.800
the question. Why do you boast of evil?

285
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.400
David Sees at the tongue of doughag has potted all

286
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.000
this destruction.

287
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.000
David sees and understands that these men love evil

288
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.000
more than they love the Lord.

289
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.900
They love with salt can offer them.

290
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.000
More than doing what is right.

291
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.500
David knows that Saul's words are seeking to devour him.

292
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:40.900
the most importantly

293
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.600
David knows

294
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.000
the God will be faithful.

295
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.700
in the midst of evil

296
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.500
God will be faithful in the midst of

297
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.100
evil.

298
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.700
And so we've already tried to put ourselves in issue of shoes of Doak, but

299
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.600
if we put ourselves in the shoes of David.

300
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.900
David is living on the Run.

301
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.200
He's constantly looking over your shoulder. He doesn't know who he can trust.

302
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.200
84 people just died because of

303
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.500
him in a simple interaction.

304
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.600
this emotional

305
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.700
spiritual toil had

306
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.300
to be heavy

307
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.800
it had the way on his soul.

308
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.400
And remember David was the anointed king at this point. So this is what his life

309
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:32.800
was looking like.

310
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.500
but remember

311
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.200
David is calling the people to look to God's faithfulness

312
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.300
in the midst of evil.

313
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.200
through everything that transpired and first Samuel

314
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.400
David is still telling the people. Hey.

315
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.700
evil will not conquer

316
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.900
evil will not stop who God is

317
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.300
and we feel this.

318
00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.600
We see it.

319
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.200
the holiday season

320
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.800
we feel the pain.

321
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.400
We see the hurt.

322
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.100
It is hard to think. How is God gonna be

323
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.700
faithful through this?

324
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.700
How is God going to redeem this situation?

325
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.000
and so

326
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.100
it's easy to say God will be faithful in the midst

327
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:24.400
of evil.

328
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.500
But do we believe this?

329
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.200
Do we believe these words?

330
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.900
And so if you reflect on your own life and ask these questions.

331
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.300
When you see all the pain in Brokenness around

332
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.500
you.

333
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.200
You trust that God will work things

334
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:41.300
out.

335
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.600
Are you seeking to find your own solution?

336
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.800
in your own healing

337
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.200
in your own way.

338
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.200
Do you trust that the steadfast love of God will endure

339
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.500
forever?

340
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.300
Or do you find yourself throwing in the towel?

341
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.600
Because life is just gotten too hard.

342
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.100
And I don't think we should compare situations. But if

343
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.400
we look back at David's life later when we

344
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.300
learned that he was actually in the position to

345
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.900
kill Saul a couple of times.

346
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.300
Which means all his problems

347
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:17.800
could have went away.

348
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.100
This means he could have finally found rest.

349
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.100
He could have went home.

350
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.400
But David knew that would have been in direct opposition.

351
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:30.900
to the Lord

352
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.400
That was not what the Lord had for.

353
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.600
David chose to continue to trust in the steadfast love.

354
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:41.800
of God

355
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.800
even through the midst of evil.

356
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.600
He continued to find his Refuge instead of

357
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.800
looking to his own plans or his

358
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.200
own remedies.

359
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.100
And I get it. It's not easy.

360
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.100
And it's true that I don't know all of your stories in here.

361
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.300
I mean, I know the situation that you're currently walking through.

362
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.700
But back in Psalm 52, we can see the confidence that

363
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.200
David had in verses 5 through 7.

364
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.100
We see that God will be faithful

365
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.300
to judge.

366
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.600
God will be faithful to judge.

367
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.800
Listen again to what it says in Psalm 52 verses 5

368
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.500
and 7.

369
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.900
But God will break you down forever.

370
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.600
He will snatch and tear you from your tents.

371
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.500
He will uproot you from the land of the living.

372
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.900
The righteous shall see and fear.

373
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.900
and shall laugh at him saying

374
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.200
see the man who would not make God his Refuge.

375
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.800
But trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought

376
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.400
refuge in his own destruction.

377
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.500
We can see the reason David had this confidence.

378
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.500
Is because he knew that God would

379
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.800
write every single wrong.

380
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.100
He knew that God would judge the evil of this world.

381
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.000
This isn't a new theme in the Bible.

382
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.200
David would have grown up hearing these stories about how God rescued his

383
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.400
people.

384
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.000
from pharaoh

385
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.400
and how he brought judgments to Pharaoh because of the evil that

386
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.400
was transpiring there.

387
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.900
We see what happens when we don't make God our refuge.

388
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.300
We see what happens when we think that our abundance of

389
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.600
riches will lead us somewhere.

390
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.400
The only place that will lead us is destruction.

391
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.200
And I believe this section actually serves two different purposes.

392
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.900
one of the ways it speaks to us is this

393
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.600
David is speaking to his fellow believers.

394
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.600
And he wants to encourage them.

395
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.500
He wants them to remain obedient despite the

396
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.100
circumstances.

397
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.900
He knows that God sees this evil.

398
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.400
And will judge this evil he wants them to see that.

399
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.900
We know that Vengeance Belongs to the Lord.

400
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.600
And we can rest and have peace through the Brokenness all around

401
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:14.900
us.

402
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.400
The based on the context the situation

403
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.600
David's in I believe it serves another purpose as

404
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:23.700
well.

405
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.400
Have you taken notes or anything? I just I want you guys to pause

406
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.900
and just listen to this.

407
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.900
The other purpose is Tech serves.

408
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.700
Is that God will judge all unrighteousness?

409
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.000
God is faithful faithful to judge the evil around us.

410
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.400
And if we're honest with ourselves.

411
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.100
We have to understand that we all stand guilty before the Lord.

412
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.300
And God is not in the business of sleeping sins under

413
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.100
the rug or looking the other way.

414
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.000
If God is faithful to judge evil.

415
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.100
Then we have to understand that we are all evil.

416
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.900
We are all broken.

417
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.200
All of our sins will be judged.

418
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.700
We see the actions of the Mighty Man and the first four verses and

419
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.800
we can recall times where we have sought to devour

420
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.700
or have been deceitful or boasted an

421
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:21.800
evil.

422
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.200
And if you think that you're good, and that's not

423
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.400
me.

424
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.200
First John tells us that if we say we have

425
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.800
no sin.

426
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.900
We deceive ourselves.

427
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.200
And the truth is not in US.

428
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.700
And if we flip the page in our Bible and take a peek at Psalm

429
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.000
53, it says that they have all Fallen.

430
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.100
Together they have become corrupt. There is none who does

431
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.700
good not even one.

432
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.600
And Paul picks up the same exact theme in Romans

433
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.400
when he saw into both Jews and Gentiles how

434
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.200
they have all fallen short of the glory of God.

435
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.400
all condemned all stand guilty

436
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.800
and so yes, it is awesome that God will judge the

437
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.800
evil of this world and he'll be faithful to do that.

438
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.900
But we're all guilty.

439
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.900
We all have evil in US.

440
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.300
Do you understand that?

441
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.200
Do you understand that we all fall short?

442
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.600
And so I read early in first John chapter 1 just just verse

443
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.300
8, but if you keep reading in verse 9, we'll

444
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.600
see the greatest news that we can ever hear.

445
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.900
If we confess our sins.

446
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.800
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.

447
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.300
And to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

448
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.100
If we admit that we have sin and we deserve the fullness

449
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.100
of God's Wrath.

450
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.000
Then it says God.

451
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.900
Will forgive us.

452
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.100
and cleanse us

453
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.300
But you're like, okay. You just said that God doesn't sleep sense of the rug. How

454
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.600
does how does this process even work?

455
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.400
You're right. God does not sweep our sins under

456
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.500
the rug.

457
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.900
Someone still has to pay for all that evil.

458
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.700
And punishment that was due to us.

459
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.400
Was put on Jesus.

460
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.200
We learned that Jesus was the propitiation for our sins,

461
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.700
which is a fancy word of just saying that Jesus satisfied the

462
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.000
wrath of God.

463
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.600
On our behalf.

464
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.800
Not only did he satisfy the wrath of God, but he reconciled us to

465
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.200
God.

466
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.100
And so God is faithful to judge the evil of the

467
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.400
world.

468
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.300
And put it on Jesus.

469
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:53.900
for us

470
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.800
and so if you've never heard of the name Jesus or have just

471
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.300
never truly put your faith in Jesus. I want

472
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.100
to take this moment to tell you.

473
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:04.900
Do it.

474
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.700
Put your faith in Jesus.

475
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.100
Jesus was the god man who

476
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:13.700
came down.

477
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.500
Lived a life that we could never live.

478
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.000
A perfect life with no sin.

479
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.500
And he died to death that we all deserve.

480
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.000
That is who Jesus is Jesus is

481
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.700
the one who satisfied God's Wrath.

482
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.200
for you

483
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.100
So put your faith in Jesus.

484
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.100
Because Believers in the room.

485
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.900
We can have confidence that the wrath of God was satisfied on Jesus.

486
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.700
but if you've never put your faith in Jesus

487
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.200
God is going to judge that in the future.

488
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.500
So our hope is in the fact that God sees the Brokenness.

489
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.200
And the evil of the world and will judge it.

490
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.200
The pain everything we see around us.

491
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.300
God will make right.

492
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.700
And that's the confidence that we have.

493
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.400
Our father has not forgotten about us. So be encouraged

494
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.000
by what David says in this song.

495
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.700
But once again if you have never put your faith in Jesus.

496
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.600
This Psalm may serve as a warning.

497
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.100
And I'm not trying to scare anyone in here. I'm not

498
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.100
trying to be anyone up.

499
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.500
I just want to show you the necessity of the cross.

500
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.000
How we all need to put our faith in Jesus?

501
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.400
Thanks be to God that he's faithful to judge all the wrong in the

502
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.700
world.

503
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.900
Thanks be to God that he has saved us through the

504
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.400
blood of Jesus.

505
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.400
So we see this confidence that David has.

506
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.700
But how are we to do this? How is David able to stand firm and

507
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.500
rest in this midst of evil?

508
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.900
Listen to what? He says as we close out our texts and verses 8 and

509
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.100
9.

510
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.000
But I am like a green olive tree in the

511
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:09.900
house of God.

512
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.300
I trust in the steadfast love of God.

513
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.900
forever and ever

514
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.800
I will. Thank you forever.

515
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.500
Because you have done it.

516
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.100
I will wait for your name.

517
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.400
for it is good in the presence of

518
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.000
The Godly

519
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.900
David tells us that God will be faithful.

520
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.400
to save

521
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.400
God will be faithful.

522
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.300
to save

523
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.000
now for those in here who have been keeping up with the NFL for

524
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.600
the last I don't know five to

525
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.000
six years. You understand that there has been

526
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.800
one team that has been dominant behind my

527
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.100
Pittsburgh Steelers come home for 12 anyone.

528
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.900
Uh, there's been one thing that's been super dominant.

529
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.300
Throughout these last this last stretch.

530
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.900
And it pains me to say the team's name, so I'm not but I

531
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.900
just know I'm referring to that team that plays in Missouri

532
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.200
their colors kind of remind you of

533
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.500
McDonald's.

534
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.000
The quarterback's name is Patrick. You guys know I'm talking about the Chiefs.

535
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.800
Yeah, I'm talking about the Chiefs.

536
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.400
Yeah.

537
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.000
Well the unique thing about this team.

538
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.200
Is that over the years the quarterback has instilled so

539
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.200
much peace into this fan base.

540
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.100
No matter what the score is or how much time is left.

541
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.200
Well, I'm unless it's like a blowout.

542
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.400
That if the game is in Striking Distance if

543
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.300
they can win it by a touchdown know how to no matter how

544
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.200
much time is left.

545
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.300
They can do it.

546
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.600
And so now I'm talking to Chiefs fans and I'm like, hey, like, hey,

547
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.200
the game was gonna really close there. You guys had like 40 seconds

548
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.200
left two timeouts. How are you feeling? Were

549
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.200
you nervous? And they look at me like I'm crazy. They're like,

550
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.600
you're not know who our quarterback is. We have Patrick Mahomes.

551
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.000
Obviously, he's gonna drive down.

552
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.300
He's gonna win the game.

553
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.400
These Chiefs fans have so much peace now.

554
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.400
And so now look at our text.

555
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.700
David tells us he is like a green olive

556
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.300
tree.

557
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.600
David is telling us that he is firmly rooted.

558
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.300
And who is God is?

559
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.600
Why?

560
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.800
Because this God will be faithful to save.

561
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.400
It's a deliver him.

562
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.700
That's the confidence that David leaves us with and David doesn't

563
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.100
just leave us with that confidence and says hey figure it out.

564
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.100
Figure out how to be a tree.

565
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.700
No, he actually walks us through some steps that he

566
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.600
takes and that he practices.

567
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.000
To be faithful to God as God is faithful to

568
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.200
him.

569
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.500
We see David makes God his refuge. And

570
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.400
this is the word that I've mentioned and David has

571
00:28:59.400 --> 00:28:59.700
mentioned.

572
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.300
But we see three things that David does that we can practice today.

573
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.300
Well, everyone else is trusting in their own resources and their own

574
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:09.600
remedies.

575
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.200
He wants the people of God to do these three things.

576
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.000
First David puts his trust in the Lord. He says

577
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.000
I trust and it's that fast love of God.

578
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.200
We can wear ourselves out in this dream trying to

579
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.600
figure out every solution and every situation that we're

580
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:29.600
in.

581
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.200
And trying to figure out how things are going to work out.

582
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.800
And taking matters into our own hands.

583
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.500
But David chooses to trust in God.

584
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.400
So we need to all look around and ask ourselves.

585
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.000
What areas in our lives are we not trusting the

586
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.200
Lord?

587
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.600
Is the one who gave his son for you not worthy

588
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.300
of your trust.

589
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.800
The second way David shows us how we can make God our refuge.

590
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.300
Is by thanking him?

591
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.200
Why should we thank him.

592
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.300
When we look around we just see Brokenness and

593
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.900
pain what is there to be thankful for?

594
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.400
We should thank him for the faithfulness that he has shown us.

595
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.800
We should thank him because he saved us from judgment.

596
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.700
If we look in Psalm 52, we see

597
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.700
this really cool thing. We see a bookend of

598
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.400
50 song 52 verse 1 opens up with a faithfulness

599
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:33.800
of God.

600
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.800
And it closes talking about the faithfulness of God. So what

601
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.400
he wants us to see is the faithfulness

602
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.400
of God, and so that's what we should be thankful for.

603
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.200
That God has saved us

604
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.500
and God is faithful and God did send his

605
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.200
son to die on the cross for our sins. That's why we

606
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:53.800
should thank him.

607
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.200
The Third Way that David shows how we can make

608
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.800
God our refuge is by waiting on him.

609
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.800
And this is an idly just standing by and waiting for

610
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.600
God to return.

611
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.100
And there are more ways but to wait on God,

612
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.900
but in Psalm 52.

613
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.900
He shows us.

614
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.000
He waits in the presence of The Godly.

615
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.600
And so what that means is we should wait together for

616
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.200
the return of our King.

617
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.800
by encouraging one another

618
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.000
and pushing each other towards the cross.

619
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.000
when life gets hard as it often does

620
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.100
we wait by reminding each other that God will be

621
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.700
faithful and God is faithful today.

622
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.600
when fatigue starts to set in

623
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.900
and you're feeling the weight of everything.

624
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.600
We remind each other as Believers. Hey, God hasn't forgotten

625
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:55.800
about us.

626
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.500
We we tell each other. Hey, look what God has done at

627
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:00.900
the cross.

628
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.300
And we look forward to the day of God

629
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:04.600
coming back.

630
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.400
And so encourage one another as David is

631
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.000
encouraging us.

632
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.000
about the faithfulness of God

633
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.500
God will be faithful in the midst of evil.

634
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.100
God will be faithful to judge.

635
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.100
And God will be faithful to save and to deliver us.
