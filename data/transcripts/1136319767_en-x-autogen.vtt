WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:03.925
I'm thankful for how you've designed, um,

2
00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:10.005
just gathering with people to operate so that uh, no matter

3
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.845
what we have going on in our own individual lives, uh,

4
00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:17.285
we have one another to lean on, to equip one another, to

5
00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.925
shoulder and share our burdens with, to hear

6
00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.125
what you're doing in their lives and our lives,

7
00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:29.525
and share a collective experience together as we all look

8
00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:32.085
to glorify you, worship you in our lives.

9
00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:33.565
Speak to us tonight your word.

10
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:38.445
I pray that you'll open our eyes to see things about you

11
00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.165
and about your creation

12
00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:42.845
and how it reflects your glory

13
00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:46.085
as we examine your word tonight.

14
00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:48.525
We love you. We thank you for your son Jesus,

15
00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:50.805
and the salvation we have in Him.

16
00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:53.445
It's in His name we pray. Amen.

17
00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:57.845
Well, I do thank you all for coming tonight.

18
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.765
Uh, my hope is that this study of systematic theology

19
00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:05.005
that we've been going through this semester, uh,

20
00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:08.165
has been both educational on the one side

21
00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:11.885
and stirring in your souls, uh, as we've

22
00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.245
considered the riches of God's glory together

23
00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:18.125
through these topics as we've looked at the word

24
00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:21.165
and how God's word illuminates and,

25
00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:25.005
and highlights these aspects of his creation, of who he is,

26
00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:27.765
um, how the world

27
00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:30.965
and life operates together as we've examined that together.

28
00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:32.765
And I want to thank Trevor.

29
00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.845
I don't know if he's here this evening. I'll see him.

30
00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:40.085
Um, we thank Trevor for meeting our discussion last week.

31
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:43.485
Uh, so last week we went through the first part

32
00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:45.805
of the doctrine of man.

33
00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:48.205
We highlighted God's design

34
00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:50.165
and purpose for creating humanity,

35
00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:54.685
humanity being his image bearers in the world.

36
00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:57.805
We're going to continue that topic tonight.

37
00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:01.605
We're gonna zoom in a little further into

38
00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:04.605
what humanity looks like according to God's design,

39
00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:09.885
specifically how he created humanity, us as humans, male

40
00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.445
and female, for his glory and for our goods.

41
00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.005
That'll be our topic tonight.

42
00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:18.205
Uh, before we get into that, I'll introduce myself.

43
00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:20.325
If you don't know me, my name is Chris Cross

44
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:24.725
and I've had the privilege, the humble honor of getting

45
00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:26.685
to serve as winter elders over the last year.

46
00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:30.205
Uh, it's my, honestly, it's my joy

47
00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:33.845
to serve the church in this way, um, in more ways than I've

48
00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:37.005
realized, um, before even serving in this role.

49
00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.325
It's been, it's been an honor

50
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.285
and I speak on behalf of all the elders

51
00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:45.725
when I say if there's anything that we can do, uh,

52
00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:50.445
to serve you, to care for you, to pray with you

53
00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:52.445
and for you, please let us know.

54
00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:56.165
Um, we meet, um, every other Tuesday, the first

55
00:02:56.225 --> 00:03:00.685
and third Tuesdays, uh, of the month as our other meeting.

56
00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.525
Uh, we meet from six o'clock until

57
00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:05.765
whenever we finish at the evening.

58
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:08.165
Please come join us for those meetings.

59
00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:10.805
If you have any specific things that you would want us

60
00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:12.685
to pray for you on, please let us know.

61
00:03:13.075 --> 00:03:15.885
We'd love to have you come in and pray those times.

62
00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:20.125
So, um, let's let, just let us, let me let remind you

63
00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:22.125
that we are accessible to you in that way.

64
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.045
Alright, so let's get started on our topic tonight.

65
00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:30.605
If you'll bear with me, I want to start

66
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:31.725
with an exercise here.

67
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.925
Sometimes these feel awkward, it's gonna be fun, trust me.

68
00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:36.965
So go ahead and close your eyes.

69
00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:38.485
Nothing weird about closing your eyes.

70
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:40.965
You might fall asleep, that's okay.

71
00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:44.765
But as you close your eyes, I want you to picture

72
00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:48.405
that you are suddenly in the middle of a crowded street.

73
00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.405
There are sounds of people all around you

74
00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:56.325
walking briskly this way and that way.

75
00:03:57.865 --> 00:04:00.125
All kinds of people are in this crowd.

76
00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:05.165
There's young, there's old, there's women, there's children,

77
00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:10.565
there's groups of internationals all around you.

78
00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:13.525
Everywhere. There's people just every direction you hear

79
00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:17.965
them, there's almost overwhelming

80
00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:19.085
noise everywhere.

81
00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:21.685
There's machines creaking, there's bells ringing,

82
00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:24.645
there's a man shouting in the distance,

83
00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:26.545
there's a toddler crying.

84
00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:33.175
There seems to be this endless refrain of music all around.

85
00:04:33.175 --> 00:04:36.255
You can't really quite tell where it's coming from,

86
00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:41.815
but you haven't opened your eyes yet for all you know.

87
00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:44.055
You really could be in Times Square,

88
00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:47.515
you could be in Tokyo, you could be in Tulsa.

89
00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:52.835
Maybe you're standing in midway at the great state fair

90
00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:56.655
of Oklahoma, But

91
00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:58.095
then you open your eyes.

92
00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:01.455
So go ahead and open your eyes and you see a sea

93
00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:03.735
of these everywhere around.

94
00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:10.255
So where are you? Disney World,

95
00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:13.855
maybe Disneyland depends on your west coaster or not.

96
00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:17.415
Yeah, Disney World unmistakably, you are at some

97
00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:19.135
sort of Disney Park.

98
00:05:19.755 --> 00:05:20.535
And how do you know

99
00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:26.455
Branding Brandy, right?

100
00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:29.175
Well, everywhere. One, everywhere you look,

101
00:05:29.275 --> 00:05:30.335
you see these, right?

102
00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:32.895
I don't know if you've been to a Disney Park recently,

103
00:05:33.035 --> 00:05:35.455
but it wasn't like that when I was a kid.

104
00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:37.735
But now every single person in the park

105
00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:39.415
wears something like this.

106
00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:41.375
Adults, kids, everywhere.

107
00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:45.135
But it's not just the people wearing these ears.

108
00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:49.455
Everywhere you look, you see those sets

109
00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:53.775
of ears everywhere You see it on the pins that the,

110
00:05:53.845 --> 00:05:55.175
that the employees are wearing.

111
00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:59.885
You see on the signs, you see even pictures and the flowers

112
00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:03.645
or how the bushes are arranged, the statues,

113
00:06:03.705 --> 00:06:08.245
the video screens, the ground even has those ears.

114
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:12.485
Everywhere you look, you even hear that high pitched voice.

115
00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.685
So, oh boy, everywhere, all the sound,

116
00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:18.445
it's the best I can do. Pretty

117
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:19.445
Good.

118
00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:23.245
Even in unexpected places, you find

119
00:06:23.475 --> 00:06:25.045
what are called hidden mickey's.

120
00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.205
I didn't know this was a thing, but this is a thing you find

121
00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.365
hidden Mickeys everywhere and the hedges

122
00:06:30.505 --> 00:06:32.325
or the decorations and the walls.

123
00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.245
And there's a whole subculture about fun

124
00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:37.565
around finding these hidden Mickeys in Disney parks.

125
00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.605
This place is saturated.

126
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:43.765
You could say with Mickey's, one could even say

127
00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:45.205
that Disneyland

128
00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:49.165
and Disney World is filled with the image of Mickey.

129
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:53.485
And that language sounds con familiar, doesn't it?

130
00:06:55.905 --> 00:06:57.765
How does that language sound familiar to you?

131
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.205
Deal with the image of me.

132
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:12.265
Anyone?

133
00:07:15.105 --> 00:07:16.605
Christ is the image of God,

134
00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:18.045
Christ the image of God.

135
00:07:18.895 --> 00:07:20.485
Where else do you hear language about

136
00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:22.965
filling a place with the

137
00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:26.245
We were made in the image of God. Made

138
00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.685
In the image of God. Yep.

139
00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:30.445
The Holy Spirit filled their room

140
00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:31.795
Filling. Yeah,

141
00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:32.645
filled the room.

142
00:07:33.895 --> 00:07:36.435
We talked a lot about this topic last week, right?

143
00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:39.555
Trevor led us in some discussions

144
00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:42.835
that there are similar phrases all over the book of Genesis.

145
00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:48.235
Things like filling the earth, being created in the image

146
00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.475
of God, that imagery we see.

147
00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:53.275
Um, I'm just gonna as a side note,

148
00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:56.195
encourage you if you've uh, not ever spent a lot

149
00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:58.275
of time in the Book of Genesis, please do.

150
00:07:59.055 --> 00:08:01.915
Um, and if you have in the past, do it again.

151
00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:05.795
Um, there is so much in the book of Genesis

152
00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:07.995
that every time you look at it

153
00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:10.555
and study it, God opens up my eyes

154
00:08:10.695 --> 00:08:15.675
to brand new things about him, his creation, us about Jesus.

155
00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.675
His redemptive plan for, for humanity

156
00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:22.155
and for creation is just littered

157
00:08:22.155 --> 00:08:23.235
all through the Book of Genesis.

158
00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:25.555
So please spend some time in that book.

159
00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.835
But as we read last week, as Trevor pointed us to last week,

160
00:08:31.935 --> 00:08:34.875
we begin to see language like this used in the very

161
00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:36.115
first chapter of Genesis.

162
00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.555
So if you had your Bibles, go ahead

163
00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:40.355
and turn with me to Genesis one

164
00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:47.435
and we'll someone, someone read Genesis one versus 26

165
00:08:47.435 --> 00:08:49.235
through 28 when you get there

166
00:08:57.185 --> 00:08:59.885
And God said, let us make man in our image

167
00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:05.205
after our likeness And let them have dominion over the

168
00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:07.925
fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens

169
00:09:07.925 --> 00:09:11.325
and over the livestock and over all the earth

170
00:09:11.465 --> 00:09:13.885
and over ever creeping theme that creeps on the earth.

171
00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:16.125
So God created man in his own image

172
00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:19.005
and the image of God created him, male and female.

173
00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:21.925
He created this and God bless them.

174
00:09:22.105 --> 00:09:24.725
And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply

175
00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:26.645
and fill the earth and subdue it

176
00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:29.085
and have dominion over the fish and the sea

177
00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:31.365
and over the birds and the of the heavens

178
00:09:31.945 --> 00:09:35.685
and over ever living thing that moves on the earth.

179
00:09:37.805 --> 00:09:42.575
Yeah. So we talked

180
00:09:42.575 --> 00:09:45.655
about this passage last week.

181
00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:51.695
We're gonna, we're gonna focus in a little bit

182
00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:52.895
deeper on this tonight.

183
00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:03.155
So I'm gonna write this verse out here

184
00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:04.915
'cause we're gonna come back to this in just a bit.

185
00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:10.955
But before we do, before we really focus in

186
00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:13.355
on this, I want us

187
00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:16.075
to build a little bit more on the major biblical themes

188
00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:18.475
that we see laid out in 26 through 28.

189
00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.955
Because they're gonna set up a lot of

190
00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:21.995
what we talk about tonight.

191
00:10:22.775 --> 00:10:25.475
So God, in this creation account, he states

192
00:10:25.475 --> 00:10:27.955
that he created man as male

193
00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:31.955
and female to ultimately multiply

194
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.475
and fill the earth with his image.

195
00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:38.035
Just the command that he gave man to do right And acting

196
00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:41.555
as his representatives over all created things on earth

197
00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:44.155
to subdue the earth, to rule over the earth.

198
00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:47.195
And this isn't the only place

199
00:10:47.195 --> 00:10:50.035
that we see this instruction given actually it's repeated

200
00:10:50.595 --> 00:10:51.875
multiple times throughout Genesis

201
00:10:52.135 --> 00:10:53.475
and the rest of the Old Testament.

202
00:10:54.215 --> 00:10:55.475
And I want us to take a look at that

203
00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:57.555
so we fully understand what God's doing here.

204
00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.795
So if you don't mind buckle up

205
00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:01.155
and follow this pattern with me

206
00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:02.555
because we're gonna go through this together.

207
00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:05.995
I'm gonna start in Genesis five.

208
00:11:06.295 --> 00:11:08.035
So just a couple of chapters later.

209
00:11:08.105 --> 00:11:10.395
Genesis five verses one through three.

210
00:11:11.535 --> 00:11:13.435
And regarding regarding Adam

211
00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:17.155
and his offspring, it says, when God created man,

212
00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:20.395
he made him in the likeness of God, male and female.

213
00:11:20.575 --> 00:11:22.715
He created them and he blessed them

214
00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:25.675
and named them Nan when they were created,

215
00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:29.635
when Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered his son,

216
00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:34.195
pay attention to this in his own likeness after his image

217
00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:36.035
and named Seth.

218
00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:40.195
Continue on a couple chapters later, Genesis,

219
00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:44.595
Genesis nine, Starting in verse one.

220
00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:46.195
Now this is regarding Noah.

221
00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:49.475
So the previous was talking about Adam and his offspring.

222
00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:53.075
Now we're looking at Noah starting verse one says,

223
00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:57.525
in God bless Noah and his sons and said to them, be fruitful

224
00:11:57.545 --> 00:11:59.365
and multiply and fill the earth.

225
00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:01.445
And then again in verse seven,

226
00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:06.205
for God made man in his own image and you be fruitful

227
00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:10.205
and multiply, increase on the earth and multiply it.

228
00:12:12.605 --> 00:12:16.045
Skipping over a couple more chapters, Genesis 11 verse four,

229
00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:20.735
this is in context regarding the peoples when they were

230
00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:22.135
building the city, city

231
00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:25.935
and the tower of battle, the people there said,

232
00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:28.135
come let us build ourselves a city

233
00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:31.095
and a tower with its top in the heavens

234
00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:33.375
and let us make a name for ourselves

235
00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:37.175
lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.

236
00:12:37.795 --> 00:12:39.135
So this is a little bit different,

237
00:12:39.355 --> 00:12:40.935
but I want you to recognize something here.

238
00:12:40.955 --> 00:12:42.015
Do you see the problem?

239
00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:45.255
There is said, let us make a name for ourselves

240
00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:49.055
and with the reason was lest we be dispersed

241
00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:51.335
over the face of the earth.

242
00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:53.935
So what was, what's the problem there?

243
00:12:53.935 --> 00:12:55.975
What was God's command for humanity?

244
00:12:56.975 --> 00:12:59.695
Multiply and fill the earth to multiply and fill the earth.

245
00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:04.335
So here's the people that are basically

246
00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.775
disobeying that command of God to fill the earth

247
00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:08.935
and they're saying, let's know,

248
00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:12.495
let's just stay here together and not be dispersed

249
00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:14.375
and make a name for ourselves.

250
00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:17.615
Right? So what does God do?

251
00:13:19.005 --> 00:13:21.575
Confuse the language. He confuses their language.

252
00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:26.575
And then what happens in verse nine?

253
00:13:26.645 --> 00:13:27.975
Yeah, look at verse nine it says,

254
00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:30.575
and from there the Lord dispersed them

255
00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:32.775
over the face of the earth.

256
00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:36.575
So from here, God's blessing the earth

257
00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:39.215
by multiplying his bear image bearers,

258
00:13:39.845 --> 00:13:43.415
even when it's against their will, he still fills the earth

259
00:13:43.445 --> 00:13:44.535
with his image barriers.

260
00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:47.735
But then starting in chapter 12 of Genesis,

261
00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:51.055
the focus switched from switches from this broad view

262
00:13:51.055 --> 00:13:53.255
of humanity to one family.

263
00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:57.615
So Genesis chapter 12, starting in verses one through three,

264
00:13:58.855 --> 00:14:03.695
speaking to a Abraham Lord says, go for your country

265
00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:05.815
and your kindred and your father's house

266
00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:07.135
to the land that I'll show you.

267
00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:11.735
And I'll make you a great nation and I will bless you

268
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.015
and make your name great and see you'll be a blessing.

269
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:17.245
I'll bless those who bless you

270
00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:19.045
and him who dishonors you I'll curse.

271
00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:23.685
And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.

272
00:14:25.545 --> 00:14:29.685
So do you see this continuation, the theme of blessing

273
00:14:29.685 --> 00:14:32.645
through multiplication and filling the earth

274
00:14:33.705 --> 00:14:36.485
but now focused in on, carried it to one man

275
00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:38.605
and his family, Abraham and his family.

276
00:14:39.985 --> 00:14:44.885
And it continues. Genesis chapter 17 verse six, to Abraham,

277
00:14:44.995 --> 00:14:46.965
I'll make you exceedingly fruitful

278
00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:49.045
and I'll make you into nations.

279
00:14:49.675 --> 00:14:54.445
Genesis 17, 15 through 16 to Sarah Abraham's wife.

280
00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:55.725
I'll bless her. And

281
00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:59.565
moreover, I'll give you a son by her multiplication there

282
00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:01.045
and I'll bless her

283
00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:05.165
and she shall become nations extreme multiplication there

284
00:15:05.935 --> 00:15:08.925
kings of peoples shall come from her.

285
00:15:10.665 --> 00:15:13.885
Moving forward a little bit more on Genesis to chapter 22,

286
00:15:13.935 --> 00:15:17.525
verse 15 through 18 regarding Abraham

287
00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:19.045
and now his son Isaac.

288
00:15:20.745 --> 00:15:22.645
God says, because you have done this

289
00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:26.645
and have not withheld your son, your only son Alice,

290
00:15:26.785 --> 00:15:27.965
surely bless you,

291
00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:32.045
and I will surely multiply your offspring

292
00:15:32.185 --> 00:15:33.325
as the stars in heaven

293
00:15:33.825 --> 00:15:36.045
and as the sand that is on the seashore

294
00:15:37.225 --> 00:15:39.845
and your offspring shall possess the gate of zenes

295
00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:42.365
and any of your offspring shall all the nations

296
00:15:42.665 --> 00:15:46.565
of the earth be blessed because you obey my voice.

297
00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:49.565
But if you continue on through Genesis,

298
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:54.125
this promise doesn't end with Abraham or Isaac.

299
00:15:54.755 --> 00:15:56.605
It's carried on to Isaac, his son.

300
00:15:56.605 --> 00:15:59.925
We see that in Genesis 26 verses one through five

301
00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:05.125
and then to Isaac's son Jacob in Genesis chapter 28

302
00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:06.725
verses 12 and 15.

303
00:16:08.185 --> 00:16:11.525
And again to Jacob in Genesis 35, verse 11.

304
00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:16.405
And God said to him, I am God almighty, be fruitful

305
00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:19.165
and multiply that same command that was given to Adam.

306
00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:25.605
He says, be fruitful and multiply a nation

307
00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:28.045
and accompany of nations shall come from you

308
00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:31.205
and kings shall come from from your own body.

309
00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:35.245
Forget this, the theme doesn't stop in Genesis

310
00:16:36.515 --> 00:16:40.245
looking at Leviticus chapter 26 verse nine,

311
00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:44.565
God declares that if his people Israel follow him

312
00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:47.245
and his commands, he says, I'll turn to you

313
00:16:48.025 --> 00:16:52.325
and I'll make you fruitful and multiply and you

314
00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:55.765
and and will confirm my covenant with you.

315
00:16:55.785 --> 00:16:58.365
And I'll walk among you and will be your God

316
00:16:58.905 --> 00:17:00.445
and you shall be my people.

317
00:17:01.705 --> 00:17:04.205
It sounds a lot like the Garden of Eden, right?

318
00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:06.845
Same imagery being fruitful

319
00:17:06.865 --> 00:17:08.525
and multiplying the nation of Israel.

320
00:17:08.525 --> 00:17:11.845
And God says he himself will be among them.

321
00:17:11.945 --> 00:17:16.325
It well among them, walk among them, God with humanity

322
00:17:17.225 --> 00:17:19.885
and humanity multiplying his image.

323
00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:24.205
But if you've read through the Old Testament, we know

324
00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:28.965
that Israel doesn't follow God rightly, they don't

325
00:17:29.745 --> 00:17:32.045
uh, represent his image well.

326
00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:36.405
And then in Jeremiah chapter 23, verses one through four,

327
00:17:37.895 --> 00:17:41.075
we see God declare through the prophet Jeremiah, woe

328
00:17:41.075 --> 00:17:42.675
to the shepherds who destroyed

329
00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:44.955
and scattered the sheep of my pasture.

330
00:17:45.615 --> 00:17:47.995
You have scattered my flock and have driven them away

331
00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:50.445
and you have not attended them.

332
00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:54.325
Behold, I will tend to you for your evil feeling,

333
00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:57.445
but then listen to what God says he's gonna do.

334
00:17:57.865 --> 00:18:02.405
He says, then I will gather the remnant of my flaw out

335
00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:04.125
of all the countries where I've driven them.

336
00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:08.045
So bring them out from all over back

337
00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:10.965
and then what does he say?

338
00:18:11.195 --> 00:18:13.125
I'll bring them back to their fold

339
00:18:14.025 --> 00:18:16.805
and they shall be fruitful

340
00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:20.765
and multiply the same command over and over and over.

341
00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:26.005
So we follow this pattern through the rest of scripture.

342
00:18:26.445 --> 00:18:30.045
Ultimately we see this redemptive plan for God's people

343
00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:34.685
fulfilled in the coming of the good shepherd in Jesus

344
00:18:34.985 --> 00:18:38.765
and Nazareth, the offspring of Mary,

345
00:18:40.335 --> 00:18:44.765
God's exact image, his exact image bearer come to earth

346
00:18:45.505 --> 00:18:49.725
as a man, but then

347
00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:53.125
resurrected as Jesus was, as the firstborn

348
00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:56.205
of a newly created humanity, a new Adam.

349
00:18:56.785 --> 00:19:00.365
As scripture tells us, don't miss the significance of

350
00:19:00.365 --> 00:19:02.885
what Jesus commands his disciples to do next.

351
00:19:03.955 --> 00:19:08.605
Matthew 28, verses 19 through 20, what does it say?

352
00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:11.345
What's his command?

353
00:19:14.985 --> 00:19:16.765
The great commission go, go you

354
00:19:16.765 --> 00:19:17.965
therefore into all nations.

355
00:19:19.355 --> 00:19:22.605
Yeah, go make disciples of all nations.

356
00:19:23.825 --> 00:19:24.845
So do you see it there?

357
00:19:24.985 --> 00:19:26.445
What's that command ultimately

358
00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:31.085
say, oh, and be fruitful.

359
00:19:31.235 --> 00:19:34.765
Yeah, be fruitful and multiply. It's the same command.

360
00:19:35.705 --> 00:19:38.165
Yes, maybe it looks a little different than

361
00:19:39.835 --> 00:19:42.805
procreating in the sense of making more humans,

362
00:19:43.825 --> 00:19:47.325
but he is saying make more image bearers, more people

363
00:19:47.755 --> 00:19:50.925
that look like Jesus, that follow Jesus,

364
00:19:51.155 --> 00:19:53.325
that bear the name of Jesus.

365
00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:58.765
It says fill the earth, fill the earth, multiply all nations

366
00:19:59.275 --> 00:20:02.605
with the image of Jesus, the son of God.

367
00:20:04.345 --> 00:20:07.445
So I know that's a long backstory to this

368
00:20:07.505 --> 00:20:08.845
and you're probably asking art,

369
00:20:08.985 --> 00:20:10.325
we saw a lot of that last week.

370
00:20:12.225 --> 00:20:15.165
So what does all this have to do with the doctrine of man

371
00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:16.365
as male and female?

372
00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:18.365
That's supposed to be our topic tonight, right?

373
00:20:19.345 --> 00:20:21.525
So what does all that backstory have to do with this?

374
00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:25.085
Well, quite a lot as we're gonna see.

375
00:20:26.305 --> 00:20:30.885
For one, it's rather obvious that the presence of male

376
00:20:30.885 --> 00:20:35.785
and female humans is a bit of a requirement to multiply.

377
00:20:37.005 --> 00:20:40.105
Um, hopefully everyone's already had the talk

378
00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:44.785
that's not news to you hopefully, but that's not all.

379
00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:47.965
'cause as we look at the nature of humanity as defined

380
00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:51.565
by two distinct sexes, we begin to grasp

381
00:20:52.325 --> 00:20:56.085
a greater understanding For what it means

382
00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:57.845
to fulfill God's design,

383
00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.885
to be his image bearers, filling the earth.

384
00:21:02.705 --> 00:21:04.605
So by examining this collective unity

385
00:21:04.945 --> 00:21:07.445
of mankind is both male and female.

386
00:21:08.585 --> 00:21:12.885
And the design pattern of humans being unified then

387
00:21:14.045 --> 00:21:15.495
dispersed or multiplied

388
00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:18.935
and then unified again under God's design.

389
00:21:19.395 --> 00:21:21.175
We see how God has made this identity

390
00:21:21.175 --> 00:21:22.855
of being made in his image

391
00:21:24.235 --> 00:21:27.375
to be a not individual one, but a collective

392
00:21:27.795 --> 00:21:32.255
One For

393
00:21:32.655 --> 00:21:34.655
humanity as a collective species

394
00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:37.135
to reflect God throughout the earth.

395
00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:42.215
It takes variation in our unity and in our variations.

396
00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:46.255
We're gonna see that tonight specifically as God has done

397
00:21:46.255 --> 00:21:49.095
that through creating man as male and female.

398
00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:52.535
So in the book that you're studying

399
00:21:52.535 --> 00:21:56.535
through our bible doctrine book, Grham states that

400
00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.415
although the creation of man is male

401
00:21:58.415 --> 00:22:00.215
and female is not the only way

402
00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:02.615
in which we we're in the image of God,

403
00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:05.575
it is a significant enough aspect of our creation

404
00:22:06.235 --> 00:22:09.295
in the image of God that scripture mentions it in the very

405
00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:12.015
same verse in which it describes God's

406
00:22:12.015 --> 00:22:13.135
initial creation of man.

407
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:17.135
It goes on to say that the creation of man is male

408
00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:19.295
and female shows God's image

409
00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:23.095
in one harmonious interpersonal relationships,

410
00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:27.495
two in the equality in personhood and importance,

411
00:22:28.195 --> 00:22:31.815
and three in our differences in role and authority.

412
00:22:32.595 --> 00:22:34.935
So we're gonna look at each of those in a little bit more

413
00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:36.775
detail tonight.

414
00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:42.255
So we're gonna start first with the first of those points.

415
00:22:42.745 --> 00:22:45.695
Point number one is in our personal relationships.

416
00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:48.175
So thinking back to Genesis,

417
00:22:49.075 --> 00:22:50.695
what's the first thing in scripture

418
00:22:50.725 --> 00:22:52.255
that is stated to not be good,

419
00:22:56.315 --> 00:22:57.315
Be alone?

420
00:22:57.765 --> 00:23:01.015
Yeah, he says that man should be alone.

421
00:23:01.015 --> 00:23:02.415
That that is not good.

422
00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:04.775
The first thing that we see, do you know

423
00:23:04.775 --> 00:23:07.575
what the Hebrew word for alone is?

424
00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:11.275
Any idea?

425
00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:15.415
It's Bad literally b,

426
00:23:15.735 --> 00:23:18.975
a d bad.

427
00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:25.095
And I find that so interesting that the one thing

428
00:23:25.095 --> 00:23:29.055
that God says is not good is human loneliness.

429
00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:33.055
It's the first thing to be described in our English word is

430
00:23:33.605 --> 00:23:35.375
also a Hebrew that's bad.

431
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:40.655
But we know that God doesn't create bad things, does he?

432
00:23:40.655 --> 00:23:45.365
Right? So we find out as we continue to read the story

433
00:23:45.365 --> 00:23:48.845
that is designed for humanity includes the remedy

434
00:23:49.505 --> 00:23:51.365
for this condition of aloneness.

435
00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:55.805
Gruden says that God did not create human beings

436
00:23:55.805 --> 00:23:57.365
to be isolated persons,

437
00:23:58.265 --> 00:24:01.205
but in making us in his image, he made us in such a way

438
00:24:01.205 --> 00:24:03.205
that we can attain interpersonal unity

439
00:24:03.745 --> 00:24:06.245
of various sorts in all forms of human society.

440
00:24:07.955 --> 00:24:12.005
This unity of humanity is especially deep in the family,

441
00:24:12.675 --> 00:24:15.565
both in our inner, both in our relational families

442
00:24:15.565 --> 00:24:17.525
and then ultimately in our spiritual family

443
00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:22.205
and the church between men and women.

444
00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:25.685
This interpersonal unity is experienced in a unique

445
00:24:26.385 --> 00:24:30.485
and profound way in marriage where scripture states

446
00:24:30.515 --> 00:24:34.765
that two individual persons are united as one flesh.

447
00:24:34.825 --> 00:24:36.725
We see that in Genesis two verse 24.

448
00:24:38.285 --> 00:24:40.985
So to get a clearer picture of how this design works,

449
00:24:41.115 --> 00:24:42.745
we're gonna spend a little bit of time in

450
00:24:42.745 --> 00:24:43.905
that particular passage.

451
00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:46.545
So I want us to look here at the creation

452
00:24:46.725 --> 00:24:48.265
of Eve in Genesis two.

453
00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:51.065
So turn with me to Genesis two

454
00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:54.945
and we're gonna look at verses 19 through 25.

455
00:24:55.775 --> 00:24:56.585
I'll read that for us.

456
00:25:02.925 --> 00:25:07.185
It says, now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every

457
00:25:07.275 --> 00:25:10.265
beast of the field and every bird of the heavens

458
00:25:10.725 --> 00:25:13.185
and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.

459
00:25:14.165 --> 00:25:16.785
And whatever the man called every living creature

460
00:25:17.495 --> 00:25:21.985
that was its name, the man gave names

461
00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:24.665
to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens

462
00:25:24.765 --> 00:25:26.385
and to every beast of the field.

463
00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:31.865
But for Adam, there was not found a helper fit for.

464
00:25:33.285 --> 00:25:37.905
So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man.

465
00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:42.305
And while he slept, he took one of his ribs

466
00:25:42.305 --> 00:25:44.105
and closed up its place with flesh

467
00:25:45.415 --> 00:25:48.435
and the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made

468
00:25:48.435 --> 00:25:50.675
into a woman and brought her to the man.

469
00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:56.195
Then the man said this, this at last is bone of my bones,

470
00:25:56.815 --> 00:25:58.155
in flesh of my flesh.

471
00:25:59.455 --> 00:26:00.675
She shall be called a woman

472
00:26:00.675 --> 00:26:02.555
because she was taken out of man.

473
00:26:04.815 --> 00:26:07.155
And the narrator gives narrator of this story,

474
00:26:07.155 --> 00:26:09.035
gives a little bit of like context.

475
00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:10.755
It says, Hey listen, pay attention to this.

476
00:26:11.185 --> 00:26:13.995
Therefore man shall leave his father and mother

477
00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:18.115
and hold fast to his wife and they shall become one flesh.

478
00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:21.155
And the man and his wife are both naked

479
00:26:21.335 --> 00:26:22.875
and we're not ashamed.

480
00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:26.155
So I want us to take a few note of a few things here.

481
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:29.315
One, God has a purpose

482
00:26:29.575 --> 00:26:32.115
and intentionality in everything that he does.

483
00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:36.555
So in this story, he caught on to what's kind of happening.

484
00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:40.275
It appears that God initially created a male

485
00:26:40.375 --> 00:26:44.245
and female version of every living creature except for man.

486
00:26:46.585 --> 00:26:51.405
And then God proceeded to parade these couples

487
00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:55.725
of creatures in front of the man so that he can name them.

488
00:26:56.145 --> 00:26:58.405
And so Adam, you're just picturing him sitting there

489
00:26:59.345 --> 00:27:03.005
is seeing, you know, a couple of elephants come by, each

490
00:27:03.005 --> 00:27:07.005
of their counterparts have, that's an elephant too.

491
00:27:07.545 --> 00:27:09.085
You know, he sees a lion

492
00:27:09.225 --> 00:27:11.645
and a lioness come by and sees them.

493
00:27:11.665 --> 00:27:14.565
He sees a couple green ones, I dunno however this looks.

494
00:27:15.825 --> 00:27:17.365
But each, each of those he's seeing,

495
00:27:18.395 --> 00:27:20.645
they all have their counterpart, but I don't have mine.

496
00:27:23.705 --> 00:27:28.645
And so God letting Adam see this then puts him into sleep

497
00:27:29.145 --> 00:27:31.085
and makes Eve right.

498
00:27:34.475 --> 00:27:38.525
It's almost as if God is intentionally delaying his creating

499
00:27:38.525 --> 00:27:41.005
work here in order to draw the man's attention

500
00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:45.445
and ours as the reader to this intrinsic desire

501
00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:48.325
and need for interpersonal relationship

502
00:27:48.325 --> 00:27:49.885
that we have as humans.

503
00:27:51.345 --> 00:27:56.245
So scripture says there was not found a helper fit for him.

504
00:27:57.405 --> 00:28:02.205
I think we kind of miss a little bit of what is meant by

505
00:28:02.205 --> 00:28:07.125
that term, uh, with our English transition of, of helper.

506
00:28:07.985 --> 00:28:10.365
So the Hebrew word that's we translate

507
00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:13.165
as helper often in our English translation translations

508
00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:14.845
is a,

509
00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:25.525
and it's used 22 times in the Old Testament,

510
00:28:25.525 --> 00:28:26.525
twice in this passage,

511
00:28:27.265 --> 00:28:29.965
but the other 20 times throughout the Old Testament,

512
00:28:30.465 --> 00:28:34.085
the word is not used to convey helper as

513
00:28:35.065 --> 00:28:36.205
as like an assistant

514
00:28:37.265 --> 00:28:42.085
or uh, someone who acts on behalf of the word.

515
00:28:42.475 --> 00:28:46.405
Azer is actually used every other single time to speak

516
00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:49.285
of some help in the sense of deliverance

517
00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:53.205
or a as in a battle situation.

518
00:28:54.435 --> 00:28:57.645
Some examples of this are Psalm one 15, verse nine,

519
00:28:59.385 --> 00:29:02.045
Oh Israel trust in the Lord.

520
00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:04.605
He is their help and their shield.

521
00:29:06.095 --> 00:29:08.405
Psalm 1 21 verse one, it's used there.

522
00:29:09.145 --> 00:29:12.735
The psalm says, I lift my eyes to the hills from

523
00:29:12.735 --> 00:29:13.815
where does my help?

524
00:29:14.325 --> 00:29:16.015
Azer come from my help.

525
00:29:16.525 --> 00:29:19.935
Azer comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.

526
00:29:21.075 --> 00:29:24.055
So when you start to understand the word azer, not as help

527
00:29:24.155 --> 00:29:25.175
as an assistant,

528
00:29:25.715 --> 00:29:29.535
but as someone who comes to the aid of the delivering aid of

529
00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:32.935
it starts to carry a little bit of different weight, right,

530
00:29:33.925 --> 00:29:36.615
than just someone who merely assists.

531
00:29:37.605 --> 00:29:40.495
This is especially highlighted when we pair it

532
00:29:40.765 --> 00:29:43.565
with the Hebrew word for the phrase fit for him.

533
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.245
So this is the word ne

534
00:29:49.905 --> 00:29:51.805
and then the context iso.

535
00:29:52.185 --> 00:29:56.485
So azer connector, which carries the meaning of in front of

536
00:29:56.505 --> 00:30:00.085
or opposite of corresponding to

537
00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:02.045
or parallel to.

538
00:30:03.465 --> 00:30:05.325
So put those translations together

539
00:30:06.385 --> 00:30:09.485
and ultimately what God is saying is, I will make a help

540
00:30:11.195 --> 00:30:13.405
corresponding to the man.

541
00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:19.045
So when we hear the word helper, we shouldn't think

542
00:30:19.045 --> 00:30:21.205
of a sidekick or an assistant,

543
00:30:22.305 --> 00:30:24.245
but really of a strong ally.

544
00:30:24.555 --> 00:30:29.005
Someone essential to God's purpose of reflecting his image.

545
00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:33.085
So God causes the man to fall in a deep sleep

546
00:30:33.185 --> 00:30:37.045
and he takes when already who has translations, say a rib.

547
00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:40.645
But the Hebrew word is, which is really a,

548
00:30:40.645 --> 00:30:41.805
an architectural term,

549
00:30:42.135 --> 00:30:45.205
which is every other time it's translated, is translated

550
00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:47.285
like the side of a building.

551
00:30:49.105 --> 00:30:51.485
So he takes this side from the man

552
00:30:53.665 --> 00:30:56.325
and from that side he forms the woman.

553
00:30:56.745 --> 00:31:00.685
So we have this picture of what's happening is that you had

554
00:31:01.305 --> 00:31:05.515
one man that God splits

555
00:31:06.775 --> 00:31:08.995
and he forms two

556
00:31:13.065 --> 00:31:15.595
Assault And forms two outta that.

557
00:31:17.815 --> 00:31:22.675
And then the man upon seeing the the help corresponding

558
00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:26.235
to him that God has made says, ah, finally,

559
00:31:27.705 --> 00:31:31.515
bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh, she shall be called

560
00:31:32.405 --> 00:31:34.915
woman, which is the word is Isha

561
00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:38.875
because she was taken out of man each.

562
00:31:39.295 --> 00:31:42.035
So there's a word play even showing that this is

563
00:31:42.615 --> 00:31:44.035
too many out of the one.

564
00:31:46.095 --> 00:31:48.275
So you're starting to see the beauty of

565
00:31:48.275 --> 00:31:51.155
how God created mankind to reflect his image.

566
00:31:52.605 --> 00:31:55.995
We're starting to see a little bit of a picture that there's

567
00:31:56.585 --> 00:32:00.675
some multiple multiplication here, but still yet one.

568
00:32:07.215 --> 00:32:09.715
So coming back to our first verse,

569
00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:13.395
God created man in his image.

570
00:32:14.185 --> 00:32:16.995
This word man is a do

571
00:32:19.445 --> 00:32:23.235
capitalize that a do which is humanity.

572
00:32:23.425 --> 00:32:27.955
Mankind later becomes a proper name for Adam.

573
00:32:29.015 --> 00:32:30.675
But in here in this sense is Adam.

574
00:32:30.975 --> 00:32:35.555
So God created mankind in his image, In the image

575
00:32:36.215 --> 00:32:40.245
of God, he created him a singular masculine,

576
00:32:43.205 --> 00:32:44.705
and then male and female,

577
00:32:45.165 --> 00:32:48.705
he created them plural at that point.

578
00:32:49.485 --> 00:32:53.185
So we start to see this progressive picture of

579
00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:54.825
how God has created mankind.

580
00:32:55.165 --> 00:32:58.985
One, he created all of mankind as a collective

581
00:32:59.565 --> 00:33:00.705
to reflect his image.

582
00:33:01.885 --> 00:33:05.905
He created him a singular in his image,

583
00:33:06.965 --> 00:33:11.825
but then progressively he creates both two from one

584
00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:14.625
to be his image.

585
00:33:16.445 --> 00:33:19.385
So from one being created in the image of God,

586
00:33:20.325 --> 00:33:22.665
God created two distinct persons, male

587
00:33:22.765 --> 00:33:27.105
and female, who now equally bear his image

588
00:33:28.175 --> 00:33:31.945
both being equally fully human, yet different

589
00:33:32.285 --> 00:33:36.465
and corresponding to each other for mutual benefit

590
00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:38.225
and for corporate reflection.

591
00:33:39.755 --> 00:33:43.745
Still either without the other, could not represent

592
00:33:43.745 --> 00:33:46.545
what it means to be human on our own.

593
00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:51.785
The male on his own could not represent what it means

594
00:33:51.845 --> 00:33:55.105
to be fully human, just as in the female

595
00:33:55.915 --> 00:33:58.505
could not fully represent what it means to be human

596
00:33:58.805 --> 00:34:00.105
and to reflect the image of God.

597
00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:03.385
But together they do.

598
00:34:07.925 --> 00:34:11.185
So this makeup that we start to see played out here

599
00:34:12.245 --> 00:34:15.225
can be seen to reflect in some degree the plurality

600
00:34:15.245 --> 00:34:17.145
of persons that we see within the Trinity.

601
00:34:18.095 --> 00:34:20.385
It's not a perfect picture of that

602
00:34:21.255 --> 00:34:23.705
because these two are distinct persons

603
00:34:23.705 --> 00:34:25.065
that operate outside of each other.

604
00:34:25.805 --> 00:34:27.145
God is not that way in the Trinity.

605
00:34:27.735 --> 00:34:31.225
They're all equally at the same time God at the same time.

606
00:34:32.165 --> 00:34:34.545
But we're getting a picture of what that looks like.

607
00:34:36.565 --> 00:34:40.145
But one thing that this does reflect in God is absolutely,

608
00:34:40.685 --> 00:34:43.265
it reflects our relational makeup in the same way

609
00:34:43.265 --> 00:34:46.345
that God is relational, the Trinity is relational.

610
00:34:47.605 --> 00:34:49.465
So that brings us to point number two.

611
00:34:52.085 --> 00:34:54.985
The image of God, male and female reflects God

612
00:34:55.085 --> 00:34:58.145
and our equality and personhood and importance.

613
00:34:58.245 --> 00:35:01.465
So just as members of Trinity are equal in their importance

614
00:35:01.965 --> 00:35:04.825
and in their full existence as distinct persons.

615
00:35:05.905 --> 00:35:08.165
So men and women have been created by God

616
00:35:08.225 --> 00:35:10.725
to be equal in their importance and personhood.

617
00:35:11.855 --> 00:35:16.395
So both men and women are, are made equally in God's image.

618
00:35:17.185 --> 00:35:20.955
Both men and women reflect God's character in their

619
00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:22.115
existence, in their makeup.

620
00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.715
In the female. We see certain aspects of God

621
00:35:26.715 --> 00:35:28.195
that we don't see in the male

622
00:35:28.775 --> 00:35:30.875
and in the male we see certain aspects of God

623
00:35:30.875 --> 00:35:32.355
that we don't see in the female

624
00:35:33.615 --> 00:35:36.995
and in relationships between males and females

625
00:35:37.705 --> 00:35:40.885
and every combination of the two in the relationships

626
00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:43.005
of males, of males, females, females,

627
00:35:44.325 --> 00:35:45.545
all sorts of relationships.

628
00:35:45.645 --> 00:35:47.425
Not just talking about marriage

629
00:35:47.605 --> 00:35:48.985
or sexual relationships,

630
00:35:49.055 --> 00:35:51.585
just talking about humanity relationships.

631
00:35:51.865 --> 00:35:54.545
Together we see certain aspects of God

632
00:35:54.545 --> 00:35:56.145
that are only possible

633
00:35:57.165 --> 00:36:00.065
by this unified diversity of mankind.

634
00:36:01.805 --> 00:36:04.425
So there's a, there's a side note here that I wanna make.

635
00:36:04.425 --> 00:36:07.945
That this idea extends even further into the diversity

636
00:36:08.055 --> 00:36:10.305
that we see in various human cultures.

637
00:36:10.845 --> 00:36:15.505
Ethnic, I can't say that word, and this these tribes

638
00:36:15.605 --> 00:36:19.985
and nations, there are aspects of God's image in all

639
00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:23.905
of these that we wouldn't see if we just narrowed our scope

640
00:36:23.925 --> 00:36:24.985
to one people group.

641
00:36:25.645 --> 00:36:29.425
If our scope of humanity was just Edmond, Oklahoma America,

642
00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:33.665
there are aspects of God's image reflected in humanity

643
00:36:33.665 --> 00:36:34.745
that we would never see.

644
00:36:35.805 --> 00:36:40.305
But when you compare that with people groups in Africa,

645
00:36:40.725 --> 00:36:44.265
in Asia, and a lot in Oklahoma,

646
00:36:45.395 --> 00:36:46.865
trust me, that's a people group in itself.

647
00:36:47.885 --> 00:36:49.785
You see a bigger picture

648
00:36:50.685 --> 00:36:53.265
of mankind reflecting God's image in

649
00:36:53.325 --> 00:36:54.545
all sorts of different ways.

650
00:36:56.395 --> 00:36:58.985
Groom says that if we live in a society consisting

651
00:36:58.985 --> 00:37:00.265
of only Christian men

652
00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:02.705
or society consisting of only Christian women,

653
00:37:03.365 --> 00:37:06.185
we would not gain as full a picture of the character of God

654
00:37:06.565 --> 00:37:09.705
as when we see both godly men and godly women

655
00:37:10.325 --> 00:37:11.905
and their complimentary differences

656
00:37:12.425 --> 00:37:14.665
together reflecting the beauty of God's character,

657
00:37:16.085 --> 00:37:17.185
the equality of men

658
00:37:17.185 --> 00:37:20.145
and women is further emphasized in the new Covenant church.

659
00:37:21.565 --> 00:37:26.065
We see this at Pentecost when a prophecy from

660
00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:30.425
Joel is, Luke writes,

661
00:37:30.575 --> 00:37:32.825
I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh.

662
00:37:33.005 --> 00:37:35.025
And your sons and your daughters,

663
00:37:35.535 --> 00:37:39.865
both male female shall prophesy and on my man's servants

664
00:37:39.865 --> 00:37:42.585
and my maid servants, in those days, I'll pour out my spirit

665
00:37:43.005 --> 00:37:44.385
and may shall prophesy.

666
00:37:45.725 --> 00:37:47.785
See, the Holy Spirit is poured out

667
00:37:49.085 --> 00:37:50.745
in power on both men

668
00:37:51.565 --> 00:37:54.945
and both women believers and in the church.

669
00:37:55.055 --> 00:37:56.665
This diversification of humanity

670
00:37:56.735 --> 00:37:58.905
that is bound together by holy unity.

671
00:37:59.605 --> 00:38:02.825
It continues to shine even beyond the male

672
00:38:02.965 --> 00:38:04.745
and female dichotomy.

673
00:38:04.895 --> 00:38:08.485
Paul says in Galatians, he says, for as many

674
00:38:08.485 --> 00:38:11.685
of you were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ,

675
00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:14.325
there is neither Jew nor Greek.

676
00:38:14.815 --> 00:38:16.565
There is neither slave nor free.

677
00:38:16.565 --> 00:38:17.565
There's neither male

678
00:38:17.705 --> 00:38:21.045
nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

679
00:38:21.145 --> 00:38:24.965
You collectively are all one in Christ Jesus.

680
00:38:25.995 --> 00:38:28.525
It's not to say that we are all homogenous

681
00:38:29.305 --> 00:38:31.045
as if we all looked and acted

682
00:38:31.105 --> 00:38:35.405
and were the exact same exactly like in every way.

683
00:38:35.425 --> 00:38:38.245
But on the contrary, God equips

684
00:38:38.465 --> 00:38:40.725
and gifts the church in a multitude

685
00:38:40.905 --> 00:38:42.925
of different ways from different backgrounds,

686
00:38:43.555 --> 00:38:48.245
different cultures to build up, to care for

687
00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:51.565
and to bear the image of Jesus collectively.

688
00:38:54.345 --> 00:38:57.725
He also says in one Corinthians 12, 18 and 19, he says,

689
00:38:57.745 --> 00:39:01.325
but as it is, God arranged the members of in the body,

690
00:39:01.435 --> 00:39:02.845
each one of them as he chose.

691
00:39:04.105 --> 00:39:07.285
If all were a single member, where would the body be

692
00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:11.805
as it is, there are many parts, yet one body.

693
00:39:13.265 --> 00:39:16.205
So this leads us to our third point, that while equally

694
00:39:17.035 --> 00:39:18.525
that while we share equality

695
00:39:18.705 --> 00:39:23.605
and value status importance among all humans,

696
00:39:23.605 --> 00:39:25.485
including between males

697
00:39:25.485 --> 00:39:28.925
and females, God has designed different roles

698
00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:31.205
to be carried out by men

699
00:39:31.705 --> 00:39:34.205
and women within the context of the family

700
00:39:35.105 --> 00:39:36.125
and within the church.

701
00:39:39.345 --> 00:39:41.405
So here we are to differences in roles.

702
00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.245
How does this play out in practicality?

703
00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:47.565
So one area we see this biblically is roles in the family.

704
00:39:48.945 --> 00:39:51.525
So for the sake of time, I'm not gonna spend a lot

705
00:39:51.525 --> 00:39:53.125
of time on the roles here,

706
00:39:53.465 --> 00:39:56.805
but I do want to note a few distinct roles here

707
00:39:57.115 --> 00:39:58.925
that God has purpose for many time.

708
00:39:59.825 --> 00:40:03.165
And I do wanna point out that these roles are purpose both

709
00:40:03.225 --> 00:40:05.125
before and after the fall.

710
00:40:05.335 --> 00:40:08.325
These are from original designs, aren't things

711
00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:12.565
that are a reaction to the fall that he then said, well

712
00:40:12.565 --> 00:40:14.885
because of sin, we're gonna put these roles in place.

713
00:40:14.895 --> 00:40:16.685
These were roles designed from the kingdom.

714
00:40:18.345 --> 00:40:22.565
So in marriage relationships we see that God has purposed

715
00:40:22.565 --> 00:40:25.525
for the husband to have a authority over the wife,

716
00:40:26.505 --> 00:40:31.165
though they remain equal in person, we see that the wife is

717
00:40:31.165 --> 00:40:34.165
to live in submission under the headship of the husband.

718
00:40:36.065 --> 00:40:38.045
And we see that the husband is to love

719
00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.605
and care for his wife

720
00:40:40.145 --> 00:40:43.325
in a sacrificial servant leader way.

721
00:40:46.265 --> 00:40:49.445
And we see that a marriage that exists in this way results

722
00:40:50.065 --> 00:40:54.325
in a complimentary, flourishing union where the one flesh

723
00:40:55.155 --> 00:40:59.125
made up of the husband and the wife loves honors

724
00:40:59.145 --> 00:41:02.205
and respects one another, working together

725
00:41:02.385 --> 00:41:06.125
for the ultimate glory, reflecting our savior Jesus Christ

726
00:41:06.185 --> 00:41:07.685
and his relationship to the church.

727
00:41:08.385 --> 00:41:10.325
That's what ultimately the whole purpose

728
00:41:10.345 --> 00:41:11.765
of marriage is there to do,

729
00:41:12.425 --> 00:41:15.405
is reflect Jesus' perfect union

730
00:41:15.675 --> 00:41:17.085
with his body, with his bride.

731
00:41:19.625 --> 00:41:21.045
So I know the words,

732
00:41:21.285 --> 00:41:24.285
there might be a little bit triggering authority

733
00:41:24.465 --> 00:41:26.685
or submission, and let's talk about that.

734
00:41:26.865 --> 00:41:28.045
So the words authority

735
00:41:28.045 --> 00:41:31.285
and submission tend to get a bad rap in today's culture.

736
00:41:31.465 --> 00:41:36.165
Why do you think that is? Why do people

737
00:41:36.165 --> 00:41:37.525
object to the words authority

738
00:41:37.525 --> 00:41:39.565
or submission, especially in context of

739
00:41:40.105 --> 00:41:41.125
the marriage relationship?

740
00:41:42.005 --> 00:41:43.845
I think it makes it seem like one's nice

741
00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:46.765
or one more above the mm-hmm.

742
00:41:50.545 --> 00:41:51.545
Any other thoughts?

743
00:41:58.325 --> 00:42:01.525
I say we kind of have a problem with that word, regardless

744
00:42:01.625 --> 00:42:02.805
of you're a man or a woman.

745
00:42:02.965 --> 00:42:05.645
I think we have a problem with that word in general today.

746
00:42:05.995 --> 00:42:07.285
Yeah. Nobody likes it.

747
00:42:07.475 --> 00:42:09.125
Yeah. To have an Authority over

748
00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:11.085
Them, not just in the marriage relationship,

749
00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:13.805
but just authority in general kind of makes you cringe.

750
00:42:14.035 --> 00:42:15.885
That bar's already kind of set lower,

751
00:42:16.645 --> 00:42:17.645
I think. Yeah,

752
00:42:17.645 --> 00:42:20.565
yeah, exactly.

753
00:42:21.465 --> 00:42:23.565
And, and rightfully, rightfully so.

754
00:42:23.565 --> 00:42:25.285
It has a bad wrap in our culture sometimes

755
00:42:25.355 --> 00:42:29.165
because as we all know, those roles, the application

756
00:42:29.165 --> 00:42:31.685
of those roles have been abused

757
00:42:32.065 --> 00:42:33.765
and distorted in such a way

758
00:42:33.765 --> 00:42:35.765
that they leave this bad taste in our lives

759
00:42:35.765 --> 00:42:39.235
because we've experienced it being distorted abuse,

760
00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:40.795
being distorted out of authority,

761
00:42:41.405 --> 00:42:43.875
submission being taken advantage of.

762
00:42:46.975 --> 00:42:49.875
But here I'm gonna remind you that Jesus, the son of God,

763
00:42:50.455 --> 00:42:54.875
an equal person of the Trinity Scripture tells us,

764
00:42:54.875 --> 00:42:57.315
submitted himself to the father's will.

765
00:42:57.855 --> 00:43:00.795
And this was a good thing both for his glory

766
00:43:01.015 --> 00:43:03.315
and for our good as we see scripture played out.

767
00:43:04.635 --> 00:43:06.175
And if you struggle with the idea

768
00:43:06.175 --> 00:43:08.655
of a husband's God ordained authority in the marriage,

769
00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:12.735
take a look at Matthew 20, verse 25 to 28,

770
00:43:12.735 --> 00:43:15.455
and consider how Jesus, the exact image of God

771
00:43:16.005 --> 00:43:17.455
chooses to rule in authority.

772
00:43:17.485 --> 00:43:18.495
This is what Jesus says.

773
00:43:18.555 --> 00:43:20.375
He says, when Jesus called them to him

774
00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:23.055
and said, you know that the rulers

775
00:43:23.055 --> 00:43:24.935
of the Gentiles lorded over them

776
00:43:25.675 --> 00:43:28.215
and their great ones exercise authority over them,

777
00:43:28.215 --> 00:43:32.255
talking about this abusive, um, way that authorities use,

778
00:43:33.075 --> 00:43:35.095
he says, it shall not be so among you,

779
00:43:35.515 --> 00:43:38.135
but whoever would be great among you must be your servant

780
00:43:38.795 --> 00:43:42.255
and whoever would be first among you must be your slave.

781
00:43:43.125 --> 00:43:46.415
Even as the son of man came not to be served, but to serve.

782
00:43:46.875 --> 00:43:49.455
And he gave his life as a ransom for many.

783
00:43:49.635 --> 00:43:54.175
So in Jesus's words, to rule as image bearers like Jesus,

784
00:43:54.435 --> 00:43:56.535
to have authority as image bearers,

785
00:43:57.525 --> 00:43:59.335
what does Jesus instruct us to do?

786
00:44:00.005 --> 00:44:01.935
What does he instruct the husband to do?

787
00:44:02.075 --> 00:44:04.095
How should he exercise authority?

788
00:44:06.555 --> 00:44:08.775
Be a servant? To be a servant, yeah.

789
00:44:10.155 --> 00:44:12.975
To give of himself just as Jesus did for the church.

790
00:44:14.635 --> 00:44:18.215
And so when you think about that relationship, us

791
00:44:18.235 --> 00:44:21.655
as husbands that challenge us, step into

792
00:44:21.655 --> 00:44:23.255
that leadership role in the marriage,

793
00:44:24.005 --> 00:44:25.415
step into that authority role.

794
00:44:26.195 --> 00:44:30.775
But as a servant, servant hearted, how do I serve my wife,

795
00:44:31.745 --> 00:44:33.485
how I love her sacrificially.

796
00:44:35.145 --> 00:44:37.965
Um, Joe Williams, and I'm going off a little tangent here.

797
00:44:38.825 --> 00:44:40.285
Joe Williams, uh,

798
00:44:40.285 --> 00:44:42.685
pointed out a great example of this to me one time.

799
00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:48.245
He said, authority, oftentimes in our society, we think

800
00:44:48.245 --> 00:44:49.565
of as a pyramid, right?

801
00:44:49.565 --> 00:44:52.845
Where the person at the top is the one authority

802
00:44:53.705 --> 00:44:56.205
and all those in submission are serving

803
00:44:56.345 --> 00:44:58.085
and holding up the one authority,

804
00:44:59.585 --> 00:45:02.485
but it's not so in God's kingdom really,

805
00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:04.605
authority is more like a tree

806
00:45:07.935 --> 00:45:10.685
where the person in authority is more like the roots

807
00:45:11.195 --> 00:45:15.815
down here pulling up nutrients, pulling up things

808
00:45:15.915 --> 00:45:20.335
to support the whole structure so that the one

809
00:45:20.335 --> 00:45:21.415
that is submitting is the one

810
00:45:21.415 --> 00:45:22.655
that's out here basically shining.

811
00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:27.335
And the authority structure is really the ones serving

812
00:45:27.875 --> 00:45:29.815
the rest of the union.

813
00:45:30.955 --> 00:45:33.655
So I would encourage us to think then of

814
00:45:33.675 --> 00:45:35.335
how do we do this for our wives?

815
00:45:35.675 --> 00:45:38.335
How do we support and lead and,

816
00:45:38.555 --> 00:45:41.215
and nurture our wives in that way?

817
00:45:43.435 --> 00:45:45.975
But going on past the marriage relationship

818
00:45:45.995 --> 00:45:48.855
and parental relationships to sons

819
00:45:48.855 --> 00:45:51.055
and daughters, we see that fathers

820
00:45:51.055 --> 00:45:53.295
and mothers biblically are called to operate

821
00:45:53.755 --> 00:45:57.055
and shared authority over the children, serving them

822
00:45:57.075 --> 00:45:58.375
and leading them out of love

823
00:45:58.515 --> 00:46:01.015
and strength, not stirring them up to anger,

824
00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:03.975
but spurring the children on to wisdom and godliness.

825
00:46:04.475 --> 00:46:06.375
And we see that both parents, the mother

826
00:46:06.435 --> 00:46:08.975
and the father, are worthy of honor

827
00:46:09.115 --> 00:46:12.895
and obedience in child to parent relationships.

828
00:46:13.285 --> 00:46:16.375
Sons and daughters are to honor their parents

829
00:46:16.475 --> 00:46:17.495
and obey them equally.

830
00:46:18.875 --> 00:46:22.295
And then in sibling relationships, brothers

831
00:46:22.635 --> 00:46:25.455
and sisters are to love one another

832
00:46:25.955 --> 00:46:27.695
and bury each other's burdens.

833
00:46:30.395 --> 00:46:34.575
So these roles, while not perfectly parallel, they do,

834
00:46:35.475 --> 00:46:37.095
um, carry some semblance over to

835
00:46:37.095 --> 00:46:38.375
how they're applied in the church

836
00:46:40.075 --> 00:46:43.935
and they're similar, yet different roles prescribed

837
00:46:43.995 --> 00:46:45.815
for the family of God in the church.

838
00:46:46.875 --> 00:46:48.055
For sake of time, we're not gonna

839
00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:49.135
be able to do all this tonight.

840
00:46:49.555 --> 00:46:52.215
But, uh, if you want to gain a more thorough understanding

841
00:46:52.235 --> 00:46:54.295
of these roles, I'm gonna point you

842
00:46:54.295 --> 00:46:57.455
to our roles in ministry paper that's over here printed out.

843
00:46:58.275 --> 00:46:59.895
Um, the elders finalized

844
00:46:59.995 --> 00:47:01.735
and distributed this earlier this year,

845
00:47:02.835 --> 00:47:04.455
and so I would encourage you to take that

846
00:47:04.455 --> 00:47:06.655
and view that to get a more thorough understanding of

847
00:47:06.655 --> 00:47:10.135
how we view biblical roles applied in the church

848
00:47:10.195 --> 00:47:12.495
for both males and females and how we serve together.

849
00:47:13.475 --> 00:47:17.695
But I will just address one key question here tonight as it,

850
00:47:17.755 --> 00:47:19.815
uh, pertains to roles in the church

851
00:47:20.235 --> 00:47:21.495
before I turn it over to Jacob

852
00:47:21.595 --> 00:47:23.255
to lead us out in the discussions.

853
00:47:23.755 --> 00:47:26.295
And that one question that most have when it comes

854
00:47:26.295 --> 00:47:29.175
to church is this, should some governing

855
00:47:29.265 --> 00:47:32.445
and teaching roles in the church be reserved for men?

856
00:47:33.765 --> 00:47:37.935
There's basically two primary views within,

857
00:47:38.915 --> 00:47:42.055
uh, Christianity about how this question should be answered.

858
00:47:42.235 --> 00:47:44.255
On the one hand, you have egalitarians

859
00:47:45.355 --> 00:47:48.935
and they emphasize equality between men and women.

860
00:47:50.005 --> 00:47:53.615
They hold that, I'm talking in generalities here,

861
00:47:53.675 --> 00:47:56.615
but primarily, generally they hold that no governing

862
00:47:56.675 --> 00:47:59.695
or teaching roles in the church are reserved for men.

863
00:47:59.695 --> 00:48:02.935
That all positions are open to both men and women alike.

864
00:48:04.275 --> 00:48:05.415
And there are some scriptural

865
00:48:05.735 --> 00:48:07.895
emphasises emphasis that they make.

866
00:48:08.555 --> 00:48:10.975
Um, I've listed those there in your notes, uni go

867
00:48:10.995 --> 00:48:13.015
and review primarily

868
00:48:13.015 --> 00:48:15.295
what their scriptural emphasis, emphasis is.

869
00:48:15.715 --> 00:48:20.255
On the other hand, you have complimentarians, they emphasize

870
00:48:20.255 --> 00:48:21.775
that men and women, while equal

871
00:48:21.775 --> 00:48:24.775
and value, have complimentary differences.

872
00:48:25.975 --> 00:48:27.755
And they hold that some governing

873
00:48:27.775 --> 00:48:32.035
and teaching roles in church are reserved just for men,

874
00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:35.235
although exactly which roles would vary according

875
00:48:35.255 --> 00:48:37.035
to the nomination and the congregation.

876
00:48:38.025 --> 00:48:40.885
And I've listed there the scriptural emphasis

877
00:48:41.545 --> 00:48:45.045
for complementarians with the main passages that they go to.

878
00:48:45.045 --> 00:48:48.605
There's, there's more of the needs, um, on both sides,

879
00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:50.085
but these are the primary ones.

880
00:48:53.015 --> 00:48:56.115
The last thing I'll say on this is that the HHBC,

881
00:48:56.175 --> 00:48:58.075
the Henderson Hills Elder position,

882
00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:00.315
and I would refer you again to the roles

883
00:49:00.375 --> 00:49:01.955
and ministry for more explanation.

884
00:49:02.615 --> 00:49:04.595
But in short, we see in scripture

885
00:49:04.595 --> 00:49:08.115
that God has reserved the offices of elder

886
00:49:08.335 --> 00:49:10.915
or overseer, uh,

887
00:49:11.095 --> 00:49:14.995
and the office of Deacon, uh, to be for men in the church.

888
00:49:16.255 --> 00:49:20.075
But we strongly encourage the participation of both men

889
00:49:20.075 --> 00:49:23.035
and women to appropriately use, appropriately,

890
00:49:23.255 --> 00:49:27.115
use their giftings as God equips to build up the body

891
00:49:27.215 --> 00:49:29.115
and glorify Jesus in his kingdom.

892
00:49:29.815 --> 00:49:32.235
And if you have any questions on any of those things, I know

893
00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:34.075
that was quickly run through, please

894
00:49:34.775 --> 00:49:36.035
ask me, ask for the elders.

895
00:49:36.035 --> 00:49:38.435
We had to have more of that conversation with you

896
00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:41.915
as we spent a lot of time studying that topic together.

897
00:49:42.465 --> 00:49:44.195
Alright, I'm gonna end there.

898
00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:47.955
I'm gonna turn it over to Jacob, who is going to lead us,

899
00:49:48.655 --> 00:49:51.155
uh, in a little bit more discussion on this topic.

900
00:49:56.625 --> 00:49:56.915
Good

901
00:49:56.915 --> 00:49:57.915
Evening. Also, I'm

902
00:49:57.915 --> 00:49:59.835
just gonna lead a, uh, kind

903
00:49:59.835 --> 00:50:03.475
of a short discussion time based off of what Chris said.

904
00:50:04.135 --> 00:50:06.515
Um, and so I'm just going to kind

905
00:50:06.515 --> 00:50:08.955
of list off maybe a few like things, you know,

906
00:50:08.955 --> 00:50:10.355
brain thinking about some of this stuff.

907
00:50:10.655 --> 00:50:13.075
And then we'll kind of talk about some application questions

908
00:50:13.075 --> 00:50:14.435
in our lives, ways we can apply.

909
00:50:14.695 --> 00:50:17.475
But really just want to highlight unity,

910
00:50:17.585 --> 00:50:21.115
diversity kind Trinity and how that applies to us.

911
00:50:21.175 --> 00:50:25.155
How forward we see unity within us as people.

912
00:50:25.815 --> 00:50:28.285
Um, so just gonna, uh, read a few things

913
00:50:28.285 --> 00:50:29.325
that was in, in the book.

914
00:50:29.745 --> 00:50:32.325
Uh, so, so it says

915
00:50:32.325 --> 00:50:35.485
that God did not create humans to be isolated.

916
00:50:36.565 --> 00:50:39.685
Medicine is image, which means having interpersonal unity.

917
00:50:39.865 --> 00:50:42.525
We see that interpersonal unity, uh, within the trinity

918
00:50:42.785 --> 00:50:44.085
and created us spread also.

919
00:50:44.505 --> 00:50:48.685
So this unity can be especially deep in our human family,

920
00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.685
but also in our erritory

921
00:50:51.365 --> 00:50:53.005
spiritual family here in the church.

922
00:50:53.505 --> 00:50:55.565
And so kind of some questions that I want to throw out just

923
00:50:55.565 --> 00:50:56.845
for us to discuss as a group.

924
00:50:57.265 --> 00:50:59.245
You know, first off, thinking about this

925
00:50:59.245 --> 00:51:00.285
idea of interpersonal unity.

926
00:51:00.345 --> 00:51:02.365
So how have you personally experienced

927
00:51:03.135 --> 00:51:04.685
God's image reflected in others

928
00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:06.725
through relationships in your life?

929
00:51:07.305 --> 00:51:09.405
So for the purpose of discussion, we're gonna exclude,

930
00:51:09.935 --> 00:51:11.205
we're gonna exclude marriage because

931
00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:12.525
that would be an easy one.

932
00:51:12.665 --> 00:51:14.125
So let's just think about the church,

933
00:51:14.515 --> 00:51:15.845
your relationships in your life.

934
00:51:16.185 --> 00:51:18.525
How have you experienced God's image reflected

935
00:51:18.525 --> 00:51:19.565
in those relationships?

936
00:51:37.355 --> 00:51:40.645
Loyalty, experience, loyalty

937
00:51:40.785 --> 00:51:43.925
and relationships of

938
00:51:43.935 --> 00:51:46.125
God's loyalty.

939
00:51:47.915 --> 00:51:48.915
What else?

940
00:51:51.865 --> 00:51:52.965
I'd Say serving one another.

941
00:51:55.715 --> 00:51:59.165
Serving teaching.

942
00:52:03.145 --> 00:52:04.805
Can you expand on that one just a little bit?

943
00:52:05.905 --> 00:52:10.685
Um, I'm taught by so many people every day,

944
00:52:12.555 --> 00:52:13.605
including my wife,

945
00:52:14.895 --> 00:52:18.045
Other people, often so many things about get a group

946
00:52:18.165 --> 00:52:21.685
of people together, people often bring other insights

947
00:52:21.685 --> 00:52:23.965
that maybe I'm a very black and white thinker.

948
00:52:24.265 --> 00:52:25.805
So people can bring insights to that.

949
00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:32.205
How about loving and caring? Loving and caring.

950
00:52:38.075 --> 00:52:40.285
Corporate worship is encouraging.

951
00:52:50.945 --> 00:52:52.445
So on the flip side of that, so that was

952
00:52:52.705 --> 00:52:54.405
how we see God's image reflected.

953
00:52:55.275 --> 00:52:58.245
Okay. And others. So flipping around the opposite,

954
00:52:58.325 --> 00:52:59.645
thinking about isolation.

955
00:53:00.625 --> 00:53:04.335
So how does living in isolation impact our ability

956
00:53:04.355 --> 00:53:05.735
to reflect God's image?

957
00:53:12.595 --> 00:53:12.935
See it?

958
00:53:25.195 --> 00:53:26.565
What else? Living in isolation.

959
00:53:26.665 --> 00:53:28.685
How does it impact our relationships? Like

960
00:53:33.555 --> 00:53:34.555
Jake? I have a

961
00:53:34.555 --> 00:53:35.285
question. Yeah.

962
00:53:35.385 --> 00:53:39.165
Do you Mean, uh, isolation in, in general or isolation?

963
00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:41.085
Female, male and female.

964
00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:43.405
You mean isolation, just in general. Isolation.

965
00:53:46.625 --> 00:53:47.805
No one's pouring into you

966
00:53:48.505 --> 00:53:50.085
and you're not pouring into anyone else.

967
00:53:50.665 --> 00:53:54.845
So you're not really having a time dedicated to

968
00:53:55.885 --> 00:53:57.445
learning from other people the image of God.

969
00:53:57.445 --> 00:53:59.965
And they're not, you're not allowing yourself

970
00:54:00.025 --> 00:54:01.045
to show you image you

971
00:54:03.805 --> 00:54:04.805
Previously stated.

972
00:54:09.845 --> 00:54:12.685
I I think you see it manifest throughout our society

973
00:54:12.815 --> 00:54:16.805
today, lover of oneself, one upmanship,

974
00:54:18.745 --> 00:54:21.205
self-centeredness, not caring

975
00:54:21.305 --> 00:54:24.085
for others, all those things.

976
00:54:24.905 --> 00:54:27.805
You can't reflect that if you're,

977
00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:32.325
if you're concentrating only on yourself and your own needs.

978
00:54:43.155 --> 00:54:43.445
Yeah,

979
00:54:49.795 --> 00:54:50.795
Yeah. Mike Chris talked

980
00:54:50.795 --> 00:54:52.205
about we see the image

981
00:54:52.205 --> 00:54:54.485
of God in people all throughout the world.

982
00:54:55.185 --> 00:55:00.045
So we don't get to see that just in isolation to see, uh,

983
00:55:00.045 --> 00:55:03.565
other ways, uh, that God has reflected in other people.

984
00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:06.685
So next kind of just, uh, ing point.

985
00:55:06.825 --> 00:55:10.565
So as members of the Trinity are equal in their importance

986
00:55:11.065 --> 00:55:13.085
and in their existence as distinct persons.

987
00:55:13.785 --> 00:55:16.525
So men and women have also been created by God

988
00:55:16.745 --> 00:55:20.045
to be equal in their importance and their personhood.

989
00:55:20.745 --> 00:55:23.125
So when God created them, he created them male

990
00:55:23.125 --> 00:55:25.285
and female in his image, as we talked about.

991
00:55:25.665 --> 00:55:27.765
So men and women are made equally in God's image.

992
00:55:27.875 --> 00:55:30.605
Both men and women reflect God's character in their lives.

993
00:55:31.115 --> 00:55:32.765
This means that we should see aspects

994
00:55:32.765 --> 00:55:35.525
of God's character reflected in each other's lives.

995
00:55:36.585 --> 00:55:37.765
Um, and Chris mentioned this so

996
00:55:37.765 --> 00:55:39.365
that if we live in a society consisting

997
00:55:39.365 --> 00:55:40.725
of only Christian men

998
00:55:40.945 --> 00:55:43.925
or of only Christian women, we would not gain a full picture

999
00:55:44.025 --> 00:55:45.165
of character of God.

1000
00:55:45.805 --> 00:55:47.285
'cause when we see both godly men

1001
00:55:47.285 --> 00:55:49.845
and godly women in their complimentary differences

1002
00:55:49.845 --> 00:55:52.245
reflecting the beauty of God's character.

1003
00:55:53.305 --> 00:55:56.205
So thinking along those lines, how do men

1004
00:55:56.205 --> 00:55:58.045
and women each reflect something unique

1005
00:55:58.575 --> 00:55:59.765
about God's character?

1006
00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:16.245
So I, I think, uh, in Genesis,

1007
00:56:17.145 --> 00:56:21.405
so when God created a woman, so God said the word, uh,

1008
00:56:21.565 --> 00:56:24.565
I will create a helper for you, but uh,

1009
00:56:24.565 --> 00:56:29.205
before Jesus died, he decide I will be with uh God Father,

1010
00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:30.925
but I will send the helper,

1011
00:56:31.175 --> 00:56:33.965
which is a Holy Spirit, a Holy Spirit.

1012
00:56:34.145 --> 00:56:37.365
And, uh, Jesus there evil and man, a woman there.

1013
00:56:44.865 --> 00:56:46.205
How do men and women reflect

1014
00:56:46.205 --> 00:56:48.205
Something unique about God's character?

1015
00:57:08.705 --> 00:57:13.205
The nails got anything. Nurturing.

1016
00:57:13.715 --> 00:57:14.715
Nurturing.

1017
00:57:16.185 --> 00:57:17.405
Did you say one more than The other?

1018
00:57:24.625 --> 00:57:27.485
You know, uh, I'm reminded of a story I heard a missionary

1019
00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:29.645
share years ago.

1020
00:57:29.785 --> 00:57:31.205
It was pre nine 11.

1021
00:57:31.785 --> 00:57:34.405
He was a missionary in Afghanistan before nine 11.

1022
00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:37.685
And he talked about, um, you know,

1023
00:57:37.685 --> 00:57:40.045
all the women were covered and all the women were hidden.

1024
00:57:40.545 --> 00:57:44.165
And it was just this sort of coal hard male world.

1025
00:57:44.345 --> 00:57:48.285
And not just maleness in its glory and image of God,

1026
00:57:48.345 --> 00:57:52.565
but sort of a, this sort of sad, repressed hard,

1027
00:57:53.145 --> 00:57:54.765
you know, world and leap

1028
00:57:55.225 --> 00:57:57.965
and, uh, some things that have been excel at, right?

1029
00:57:57.995 --> 00:58:02.045
Like, uh, it's, it's one of the reasons men are valuable

1030
00:58:02.065 --> 00:58:03.125
and important is

1031
00:58:03.125 --> 00:58:05.885
because they can, they're called women can do it too,

1032
00:58:05.945 --> 00:58:10.925
but men uniquely can go out and, you know, plumb buildings

1033
00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:13.085
and fight battles and you know what I mean?

1034
00:58:13.085 --> 00:58:16.045
All those things, sort of the physicality of it.

1035
00:58:16.045 --> 00:58:17.805
But I remember him talking about the image

1036
00:58:17.805 --> 00:58:21.845
of God in particular, not on display in the sense

1037
00:58:21.845 --> 00:58:26.445
that it was solely the maleness of that world

1038
00:58:26.465 --> 00:58:29.805
and there was no feminine sort of, uh, side of all that.

1039
00:58:29.825 --> 00:58:31.525
And I just, that was the first time I kind

1040
00:58:31.525 --> 00:58:33.165
of seen that in my mind.

1041
00:58:33.405 --> 00:58:34.405
I thought that was interesting

1042
00:58:35.475 --> 00:58:38.285
Because You, you lose a lot either way, right?

1043
00:58:38.555 --> 00:58:40.445
Like I think even our culture, we sort of

1044
00:58:41.235 --> 00:58:45.045
have a recent history of trying to eradicate maleness in,

1045
00:58:45.145 --> 00:58:46.805
in some ways we wanna diminish that.

1046
00:58:47.385 --> 00:58:49.845
Now, obviously we wanted to diminish male simpleness,

1047
00:58:50.025 --> 00:58:52.805
but there's also, there's male righteousness

1048
00:58:52.825 --> 00:58:55.685
and female righteousness, female sinfulness,

1049
00:58:55.745 --> 00:58:56.845
female righteousness.

1050
00:58:57.185 --> 00:58:58.845
And we want to elevate the righteous parts,

1051
00:58:59.425 --> 00:59:00.445
our god of both things.

1052
00:59:08.675 --> 00:59:10.605
Okay, next, just thinking about, uh,

1053
00:59:10.875 --> 00:59:12.245
authority and submission.

1054
00:59:13.425 --> 00:59:14.685
God, the Father has always been,

1055
00:59:14.685 --> 00:59:16.965
the Father is always related to the Son as a father.

1056
00:59:16.985 --> 00:59:19.985
It relates to the Son. And though all three members

1057
00:59:20.045 --> 00:59:21.885
of the Trinity are equal in power

1058
00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:24.485
and in all attributes, the Father does

1059
00:59:24.485 --> 00:59:25.525
have greater authority.

1060
00:59:26.225 --> 00:59:28.485
He has a leadership role among the members of the Trinity

1061
00:59:28.515 --> 00:59:30.565
that the Son and the Holy Spirit do not have.

1062
00:59:31.385 --> 00:59:33.125
And each member of the Trinity has

1063
00:59:33.125 --> 00:59:34.525
these distinct roles and functions.

1064
00:59:35.345 --> 00:59:39.405
And so thinking along those lines, what, what can we learn?

1065
00:59:39.565 --> 00:59:40.645
Because we, we talked about

1066
00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:42.405
how this like submission has its negative

1067
00:59:42.405 --> 00:59:43.445
view in our society.

1068
00:59:43.715 --> 00:59:46.165
What can we learn from Jesus's submission

1069
00:59:46.705 --> 00:59:48.045
to the father's authority?

1070
01:00:02.185 --> 01:00:05.885
It is a choice because Jesus, if he really wanted to,

1071
01:00:05.945 --> 01:00:09.405
he could have done other things at that moment.

1072
01:00:09.665 --> 01:00:12.245
And he chose the problem, the Father.

1073
01:00:19.105 --> 01:00:22.885
And it's a beautiful thing too, that submission

1074
01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:25.965
that we see in, in Jesus to the Father.

1075
01:00:26.115 --> 01:00:30.005
It's not authoritarian, it's not that,

1076
01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:31.445
like you said, it's, it's a choice.

1077
01:00:31.505 --> 01:00:34.165
It was willing, he willingly submitted to the Father

1078
01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:38.565
because he knows ultimately who the Father is.

1079
01:00:38.665 --> 01:00:41.285
And it's, it's just supposed to be that way

1080
01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:42.685
and it's beautiful that way.

1081
01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:46.805
And we, we, we warped that

1082
01:00:47.495 --> 01:00:50.005
right in our definitions of authority or how we view

1083
01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:53.845
or have seen authority play out in some ways in this world,

1084
01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:57.885
but done properly as it's modeled by Jesus is a

1085
01:00:57.885 --> 01:01:01.725
Beautiful thing, A good point about,

1086
01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:03.925
we were discussing earlier that it's viewed badly

1087
01:01:03.985 --> 01:01:06.165
and it's almost like submission is enforcing.

1088
01:01:11.445 --> 01:01:15.965
I think we confuse the idea of authority and power.

1089
01:01:19.145 --> 01:01:20.145
Power

1090
01:01:22.835 --> 01:01:25.535
And also, uh, his submission,

1091
01:01:25.955 --> 01:01:27.935
he has a relationship with the Father.

1092
01:01:28.675 --> 01:01:31.175
He spend time on plea to the Father

1093
01:01:31.635 --> 01:01:35.695
and he knows, uh, father's work, you know, in Bible also

1094
01:01:35.695 --> 01:01:39.415
of ways talking about the fighting, you know, fighting Jesus

1095
01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.655
and hide my work.

1096
01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.695
So when Bible come to, uh, Jesus,

1097
01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:46.415
he can directly code, uh, from the Bible.

1098
01:01:46.955 --> 01:01:49.455
So he has a relationship with the Father.

1099
01:01:54.455 --> 01:01:57.015
I think too, there's, uh, equality on display

1100
01:01:57.545 --> 01:02:00.975
right there equally the,

1101
01:02:02.325 --> 01:02:03.775
with sort of various roles,

1102
01:02:04.685 --> 01:02:06.055
Quality of submission.

1103
01:02:06.555 --> 01:02:09.575
But the quality is the, the, uh,

1104
01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:10.935
equality is not a question.

1105
01:02:11.245 --> 01:02:11.535
Yeah.

1106
01:02:21.425 --> 01:02:22.425
Yes.

1107
01:02:22.765 --> 01:02:25.805
I think that we as Americans have a special problem

1108
01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.005
With authority because

1109
01:02:27.065 --> 01:02:28.325
We got rid of kings

1110
01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:33.125
and we ourselves don't trust our government.

1111
01:02:33.225 --> 01:02:36.525
So we have three separate branches

1112
01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:39.005
of government competing against one another.

1113
01:02:39.545 --> 01:02:41.525
So none of them have authority over us.

1114
01:02:41.545 --> 01:02:45.005
And then we've got our guns so that if they do,

1115
01:02:45.425 --> 01:02:46.765
you know, we are an authority.

1116
01:02:47.545 --> 01:02:49.485
If we don't like our boss, we leave.

1117
01:02:50.495 --> 01:02:53.765
We're probably the least authoritarian nation in the world.

1118
01:02:54.865 --> 01:02:56.325
But one thing about Jesus

1119
01:02:56.825 --> 01:03:00.405
and his love of the authority over him

1120
01:03:01.185 --> 01:03:03.685
is there's a love and intimacy.

1121
01:03:04.265 --> 01:03:06.165
He just adored the Father.

1122
01:03:15.775 --> 01:03:18.005
Maybe my favorite thing just from this chapter

1123
01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:19.645
that was in the book, it says that, uh,

1124
01:03:20.585 --> 01:03:23.245
as we grow in maturity in Christ, we'll grow to delight in

1125
01:03:23.245 --> 01:03:24.965
and rejoice in the God ordained

1126
01:03:25.265 --> 01:03:27.005
and wisely created differences in

1127
01:03:27.005 --> 01:03:28.205
roles within the human family.

1128
01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:31.885
When we understand this biblical teaching, what men

1129
01:03:31.885 --> 01:03:34.805
and women should be able to say in their hearts, this is

1130
01:03:34.805 --> 01:03:37.085
what God has planned and it is beautiful and right.

1131
01:03:37.425 --> 01:03:40.485
And I rejoice in the way he has made me in a distinct

1132
01:03:40.485 --> 01:03:41.645
role he has given me.

1133
01:03:42.335 --> 01:03:43.925
There is eternal beauty and dignity

1134
01:03:44.185 --> 01:03:47.485
and rightness in this differentiation in roles both within

1135
01:03:47.485 --> 01:03:49.645
the trinity and within the human family.

1136
01:03:50.225 --> 01:03:53.485
It does sense of better or worse, a sense of more important

1137
01:03:53.485 --> 01:03:56.325
or less important, but men, both men

1138
01:03:56.325 --> 01:03:58.245
and women, should be able to rejoice fully

1139
01:03:58.825 --> 01:04:00.165
in the way that they have been made.

1140
01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:04.845
So the last just discussion question for y'all.

1141
01:04:05.105 --> 01:04:06.165
So how does the unity

1142
01:04:06.345 --> 01:04:10.325
and diversity in the Trinity serve as a model

1143
01:04:10.705 --> 01:04:12.365
for human relationships

1144
01:04:20.745 --> 01:04:21.885
and diversity in the Trinity?

1145
01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.285
How does serve as a model for human relationships?

1146
01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:30.075
Different Roles,

1147
01:04:32.395 --> 01:04:33.395
Different Roles?

1148
01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:34.665
So diversity,

1149
01:04:40.305 --> 01:04:42.285
I'd say the cool thing about it is that it works.

1150
01:04:55.465 --> 01:04:57.905
I think one of the really beautiful things about it's

1151
01:04:57.905 --> 01:05:02.745
that there's a, there's a mutual respect honoring

1152
01:05:03.045 --> 01:05:05.745
of each person and our relationships.

1153
01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:09.465
When you look around this room, you meet eyes

1154
01:05:09.465 --> 01:05:12.185
with everyone in here and you view one another as

1155
01:05:13.245 --> 01:05:16.745
you distinctly carry part of the image of God

1156
01:05:17.025 --> 01:05:18.165
and the way that he's creating you.

1157
01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:22.965
When you reflect him rightly, Especially among us

1158
01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:24.205
as believers, we get to share

1159
01:05:24.205 --> 01:05:26.165
that even a more elevated sense

1160
01:05:26.165 --> 01:05:29.405
because we share the Holy Spirit within us.

1161
01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.045
We share this image that he's making us into Jesus.

1162
01:05:32.665 --> 01:05:34.525
And yet we could still look around

1163
01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:37.325
and see there's so much variation, so much difference.

1164
01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:41.405
And Brad, the things that you reflect about, uh, God

1165
01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:43.085
and Jesus and what he's doing in your heart

1166
01:05:43.085 --> 01:05:45.725
through your experiences are things that I can't replicate

1167
01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:50.725
seeing you, Dan, you Mark, it's, it's incredible to see

1168
01:05:51.145 --> 01:05:53.885
how God allows us to experience

1169
01:05:54.005 --> 01:05:55.365
that in our relationships together.

1170
01:05:56.105 --> 01:06:00.445
And as we don't live in isolation throughout, we live

1171
01:06:00.505 --> 01:06:04.925
and we lean into those relationships, we begin to appreciate

1172
01:06:05.945 --> 01:06:10.405
the, uh, bond that we share in God and history one

1173
01:06:10.405 --> 01:06:12.365
and Him all at the same time.

1174
01:06:12.795 --> 01:06:15.645
It's even kind of hard to talk about in ways

1175
01:06:15.645 --> 01:06:18.725
that make sense, but it's really beautiful mystery.

1176
01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:22.965
It's Almost like you said, it's not good.

1177
01:06:44.475 --> 01:06:49.005
Alright, thanks guys. Um, to, uh,

1178
01:06:49.175 --> 01:06:50.525
again, I just wanna remind us

1179
01:06:50.525 --> 01:06:53.485
what we're ultimately talking about is the image

1180
01:06:53.485 --> 01:06:54.565
of God, right?

1181
01:06:54.975 --> 01:06:57.765
We're talking about men, women, we're talk about humanity.

1182
01:06:58.465 --> 01:07:01.005
At the end of the day, what we primarily want

1183
01:07:01.005 --> 01:07:02.685
to get our hearts and our minds around, especially

1184
01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.285
as we wrap up, but I always want to go to the reason

1185
01:07:05.285 --> 01:07:09.245
that I always want to end with a worship song is that, uh,

1186
01:07:12.185 --> 01:07:14.165
we want to not just think thoughts,

1187
01:07:14.945 --> 01:07:17.645
but we wanna stir our emotions towards God,

1188
01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.805
stir our affections towards him.

1189
01:07:20.265 --> 01:07:21.325
Uh, before we do this,

1190
01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:25.285
I'm technologically challenged again.

1191
01:07:25.995 --> 01:07:27.325
Here we go. Uh,

1192
01:07:27.325 --> 01:07:29.525
before we do it, just two things in your packet,

1193
01:07:29.725 --> 01:07:31.045
I give out two other documents.

1194
01:07:31.355 --> 01:07:33.765
Just you may wanna read the danver statement on biblical

1195
01:07:33.765 --> 01:07:36.565
manhood and womanhood and the national statement,

1196
01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:40.565
a coalition for biblical sexuality, just, uh, pastors

1197
01:07:40.565 --> 01:07:42.085
and theologians try to wrestle with some

1198
01:07:42.085 --> 01:07:44.245
of these things in a cultural context,

1199
01:07:44.425 --> 01:07:46.485
in our cultural context.

1200
01:07:47.185 --> 01:07:50.725
And, uh, anyway, you may wanna read that as you go along.

1201
01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:52.845
Add that too. It's not required reading,

1202
01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:55.125
but I want look at that as well.

1203
01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:59.885
Um, The last thing that I want to say, uh,

1204
01:08:00.635 --> 01:08:02.445
that I was thinking about, just listening

1205
01:08:02.505 --> 01:08:05.055
to our conversation, does I see them off.

1206
01:08:06.405 --> 01:08:09.785
Um, the last thing, so it's just standing in my way just

1207
01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:14.385
to use that is, is this,

1208
01:08:14.615 --> 01:08:16.685
like whenever we think about, you know,

1209
01:08:16.685 --> 01:08:18.885
sometimes people say, well, it's hard for me to think about

1210
01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:22.645
God as a father 'cause I had a bad dad,

1211
01:08:23.345 --> 01:08:26.005
or it's hard for me to think about, um,

1212
01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.205
the Lord in terms of husband and wife

1213
01:08:29.485 --> 01:08:31.205
'cause you know, I had a bad husband, right?

1214
01:08:31.765 --> 01:08:33.525
Whatever. You know, you have different things like that.

1215
01:08:34.145 --> 01:08:36.965
And, and the goal I think in humanity is

1216
01:08:36.965 --> 01:08:40.005
that when we see what's good in humanity,

1217
01:08:40.395 --> 01:08:43.925
when we see what's good in certain individuals is you say,

1218
01:08:43.925 --> 01:08:45.005
well, that's about God.

1219
01:08:45.005 --> 01:08:47.805
That actually reflects the goodness and nature of God.

1220
01:08:47.985 --> 01:08:50.165
And where you see things that are not like God

1221
01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:51.725
and they're bad, right?

1222
01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:53.045
Everything God made is good, but

1223
01:08:53.205 --> 01:08:55.285
whenever we see things that are bad in humanity,

1224
01:08:55.285 --> 01:08:58.205
whether it's husbands and wives or fathers or mothers

1225
01:08:58.205 --> 01:09:02.405
or whatever it might be, is those things remind us literally

1226
01:09:02.405 --> 01:09:04.285
what God is not like.

1227
01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:07.885
And so we can take comfort by the fact that God's not like

1228
01:09:07.885 --> 01:09:11.645
that, but these are the things God is like, in fact, the,

1229
01:09:11.865 --> 01:09:12.885
the, the negative.

1230
01:09:13.505 --> 01:09:16.125
If you fill that void with what it ought to be,

1231
01:09:16.545 --> 01:09:20.565
and that's a at least some echo of what, what God's

1232
01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.165
more like, okay?

1233
01:09:22.235 --> 01:09:23.645
Doesn't always tell us all the details,

1234
01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.445
but just could to keep in mind that,

1235
01:09:25.755 --> 01:09:29.645
that in humanity we really do have the image of God, men

1236
01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.445
and women and also men and living together.

1237
01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:33.565
Just like I love the way you drew that out.

1238
01:09:34.065 --> 01:09:38.875
So anyway, uh, how, what's the time? I'm all 48. 48 48.

1239
01:09:39.295 --> 01:09:41.955
We got three minutes to sing a five minute song.

1240
01:09:42.695 --> 01:09:44.435
So, uh, let's do this. If you gotta go,

1241
01:09:45.255 --> 01:09:46.755
as they say, you gotta go.

1242
01:09:47.575 --> 01:09:51.595
And so, so feel free to take off if you're, if you're,

1243
01:09:51.695 --> 01:09:54.595
if you're able, you can stand if you want to stay seated.

1244
01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:57.155
Either way, I just encourage this, take a few minutes

1245
01:09:57.815 --> 01:10:00.595
to sing an old song, come about fout of every blessing.

1246
01:10:01.015 --> 01:10:02.515
It turns our hearts to that, that,

1247
01:10:02.515 --> 01:10:04.675
that God is the source of all that is good.

1248
01:10:05.295 --> 01:10:07.475
If you're not able to stay in sync with us,

1249
01:10:07.785 --> 01:10:09.355
then sing it on your way out the door.

1250
01:10:09.855 --> 01:10:10.995
And uh, thanks for coming

1251
01:10:38.005 --> 01:10:40.115
Every blessing to

1252
01:10:45.855 --> 01:10:46.595
of mercy.

1253
01:10:50.465 --> 01:10:53.475
Call for songs loudest.

1254
01:11:23.075 --> 01:11:27.195
I Was Darkness

1255
01:11:27.815 --> 01:11:31.315
to You came, rescued me.

1256
01:11:32.875 --> 01:11:33.875
I was,

1257
01:13:47.575 --> 01:13:48.575
It goes on. But

1258
01:13:48.575 --> 01:13:50.115
lemme just close this in great time.

1259
01:13:50.895 --> 01:13:52.875
God, we do thank you that you are the foun,

1260
01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:56.435
you are the fountain, the source of every blessing.

1261
01:13:57.135 --> 01:13:58.275
We thank you for the goodness

1262
01:13:58.275 --> 01:14:01.075
that you have put on display in the world that you have made

1263
01:14:01.935 --> 01:14:03.275
and, and uniquely

1264
01:14:03.495 --> 01:14:06.355
and especially in the way we've talked about it in the last

1265
01:14:06.415 --> 01:14:09.235
two weeks in your creation of humanity.

1266
01:14:10.015 --> 01:14:12.885
We thank you for your goodness to us, in

1267
01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:15.445
the way you have made men.

1268
01:14:16.135 --> 01:14:17.885
Thank you for the goodness to us,

1269
01:14:17.985 --> 01:14:19.805
in the way you have made women.

1270
01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:23.765
And Lord, we thank you for the way in which in Christ

1271
01:14:24.295 --> 01:14:27.205
we're being made new day by day

1272
01:14:27.745 --> 01:14:30.045
and one day we will be made

1273
01:14:30.805 --> 01:14:32.795
completely whole again.

1274
01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:37.695
And that all of humanity in Christ that are trusting in Him,

1275
01:14:38.165 --> 01:14:41.095
that are glorified at the end of the world, at the end

1276
01:14:41.095 --> 01:14:44.295
of this age, that we will become like you.

1277
01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:45.975
And that our sin

1278
01:14:46.435 --> 01:14:50.255
and our brokenness will not only just be paid for,

1279
01:14:50.355 --> 01:14:51.895
but it will be done away with.

1280
01:14:52.395 --> 01:14:55.135
And Lord, we look forward to that day. We long for that day.

1281
01:14:55.355 --> 01:14:58.655
And I pray in the meantime that in our relationships,

1282
01:14:58.655 --> 01:15:02.415
whether it's as husband or wife or brother and sister

1283
01:15:02.955 --> 01:15:04.575
or parent and child

1284
01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:08.935
or siblings, those inner relationships between other,

1285
01:15:09.555 --> 01:15:13.175
uh, human beings, but then also especially across male

1286
01:15:13.315 --> 01:15:16.775
and female bounds, Lord, we pray you would give us grace.

1287
01:15:17.515 --> 01:15:20.135
You would give us power to walk in a way

1288
01:15:20.135 --> 01:15:21.735
that brings you glory and honor.

1289
01:15:22.515 --> 01:15:25.535
And Lord we love you and we thank you for in Jesus name.

1290
01:15:25.765 --> 01:15:28.375
Amen. Amen. Alright, ready.
