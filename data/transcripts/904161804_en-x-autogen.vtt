1
00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:00.665
All right.

2
00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:03.225
Welcome everyone. Good to see you tonight.

3
00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:08.145
It does look a little different around here in the building.

4
00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:10.305
Uh, if you have not heard yet,

5
00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:14.465
we had a pipe burst in the bathroom right back there on the

6
00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:16.465
other side of the classrooms and side of the wall.

7
00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:21.425
And it flooded all of those classrooms there

8
00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.665
down into here, which is why you see this that way.

9
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.025
All over the lobby. Actually made it into the cafe area

10
00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:31.745
and then down into the preschool

11
00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:32.865
area just a little bit as well.

12
00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:35.265
So that's great.

13
00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:36.625
We're gonna have to figure out how

14
00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.105
that works over the next couple of weeks, probably.

15
00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:43.105
Um, taking up carpet, drywall, those kind of things.

16
00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.785
So that's what's happening over the next few weeks.

17
00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:50.665
So let's be flexible in the ways we need to move groups

18
00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:52.265
around, because those rooms in there are

19
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:53.785
especially affected.

20
00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.625
And so just be aware as we come in on Sunday, things moving

21
00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:59.905
around, furniture different, all of that.

22
00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:04.785
Um, it's a sad deal, but, uh, the Lord is still good in it.

23
00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:05.865
So we're thankful for that.

24
00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:11.065
Uh, tonight we're continuing this digging deeper part of our

25
00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:13.105
Wednesday night, equipping nights.

26
00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:15.745
There are other groups going and classes going.

27
00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:18.465
Of course you can, um,

28
00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.385
you can find more information about those on the website if

29
00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:23.585
you want to look into that.

30
00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:25.865
I do have resources, of course,

31
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:28.345
every week we'll have something, a stack of books

32
00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:29.545
that you can come look at later.

33
00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:33.225
Um, I'll mention one, especially this ones down there,

34
00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.025
pretty much the same from last week,

35
00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:37.745
but, um, mentioned one especially tonight.

36
00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:40.465
But again, if this is your first time,

37
00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.665
what we do is are digging deeper into

38
00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:45.105
what the sermon was on Sunday.

39
00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:48.385
So whether I or someone else preached it, then I

40
00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:49.625
or someone else will come back on Wednesday

41
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.425
and kind of lead just a brief summary

42
00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:54.985
and then ask some questions of each other.

43
00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:57.305
There'll be a panel of people up here, elders

44
00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.985
that will help us kind of process through that,

45
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:03.065
dig a little deeper into some of the implications, some

46
00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:05.065
of the teachings, and then give you a chance

47
00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:06.385
to ask a couple questions as well.

48
00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:10.505
So lemme pray for us and then we'll get into it.

49
00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:13.505
God, thank you so much for the blessing of tonight

50
00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.585
and the opportunity to just come together in a safe place

51
00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:17.985
and a warm place.

52
00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:20.785
And we're thankful that we have the opportunity.

53
00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:21.905
We don't take that for granted.

54
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.105
And may we steward that well use it well,

55
00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.345
and that we would be humble before you and,

56
00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:31.145
and realize that you've given us this privilege, not just

57
00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:32.505
for our own edification,

58
00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:35.345
but for the benefit of others as well,

59
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.785
for your kingdom's purpose.

60
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:41.425
And so, draw us to yourself as we know more about you,

61
00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:45.265
but also then lead us to, to be your ambassadors

62
00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:50.305
in your power, called by you, equipped by you, uh,

63
00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:51.465
that we can do those things.

64
00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:54.465
Not because we in ourselves have the strength, but

65
00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.785
because you are God overall

66
00:02:56.925 --> 00:03:00.005
and in us as believers for your purposes.

67
00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:02.645
So thank you for that. God, help us tonight

68
00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.605
to see you understand a little bit more about you,

69
00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:08.085
that we would love you more.

70
00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:10.205
In Jesus' name. Amen.

71
00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:15.205
So our big rock this week was, uh,

72
00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:18.245
what we called the attributes of God, God's attributes.

73
00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:23.805
Uh, what describes his perfect, his character qualities, uh,

74
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:27.925
who, who he is, his essence, his personality, you might say.

75
00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:32.085
And just as, as best we can in our limited language, be able

76
00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:34.445
to explain what we can about him.

77
00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:36.685
Now, we need to remember a couple things

78
00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:37.765
as we get into this tonight.

79
00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:39.445
Just a, as a reminder.

80
00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:42.045
First, when we talk about the attributes of God,

81
00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:45.085
we're not talking about components of God.

82
00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:48.285
Like when you think about water being a compound

83
00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:49.565
of two hydrogens

84
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:52.485
and one oxygen put together that makes water, God is not

85
00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:56.645
like, uh, this piece and this piece and this piece.

86
00:03:56.645 --> 00:03:58.845
You put it all together. And that's God. No.

87
00:03:58.995 --> 00:04:02.685
Each of these attributes describes his total being.

88
00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:05.085
That's a bit hard to understand.

89
00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:07.965
But, but just think about it this way. He is all love.

90
00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:11.605
He is all mercy. He's all omnipotence.

91
00:04:12.545 --> 00:04:14.805
So it's not that part of him is this, part of him is this.

92
00:04:14.915 --> 00:04:19.765
It's all, all of these. So he's not component parts.

93
00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:23.525
We also, second, we can't really know the truths,

94
00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:26.365
these truths about God unless he reveals them to us.

95
00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.975
And he has, thankfully, in His word, we talked about

96
00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:32.975
that the first week, the special revelation of God,

97
00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:34.255
that he's told us about himself.

98
00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:37.215
We can know a limited version of God from creation.

99
00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:40.455
But, but in his word, he's told us about himself.

100
00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:42.575
And that's the only way we can understand

101
00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:45.815
these attributes is by virtue of his word.

102
00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:51.015
Now, we can't grasp them fully, uh,

103
00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:54.495
because we're limited in our ability to understand something

104
00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:56.295
that's outside of our understanding.

105
00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:59.615
So we can't know them fully, grasp them fully.

106
00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:03.975
And the only way we can know anything substantial about them

107
00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:05.455
is through his word.

108
00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:07.895
And we need to be clear about that.

109
00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:11.495
This is what one theologian said, apart from the revelation

110
00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:13.055
of God in his attributes.

111
00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.975
We have no knowledge of the being of God whatsoever.

112
00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:21.095
But insofar as God reveals himself in his attributes,

113
00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:24.055
we also have some knowledge of his divine being.

114
00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:26.535
Though even so, our knowledge is subject

115
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:27.855
to human limitations.

116
00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:33.215
So we can know some things about the attributes of God.

117
00:05:33.235 --> 00:05:34.495
We just can't know everything.

118
00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:36.335
We can't know it fully,

119
00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:38.975
because God is,

120
00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:41.975
is more than the sum total of his attributes.

121
00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:44.375
Like even if we were able to explain as best we can,

122
00:05:44.475 --> 00:05:49.135
all these attributes, God is more even then all

123
00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:51.335
of this study that we're doing about the attributes of God.

124
00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:56.655
Riri said that when we have listed all the attributes we can

125
00:05:56.745 --> 00:06:00.525
glean from Revelation, we have not fully described God.

126
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.085
So even if we were to spend the rest of our lives

127
00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:06.245
and generation after generation explaining

128
00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:09.405
and trying to understand the attributes, even then

129
00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:13.205
we have not fully described God.

130
00:06:13.385 --> 00:06:17.325
So we can't fully describe God,

131
00:06:18.865 --> 00:06:20.685
but he has given us language

132
00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.925
with which we can speak well of God.

133
00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:26.965
So though we can't, the the tendency,

134
00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:28.045
I'm gonna talk about this again on Sunday

135
00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:30.165
as we talk about the Trinity, which is a whole,

136
00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:31.965
whew, that's a big one.

137
00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:36.645
But, uh, even though we can't fully explain it,

138
00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:39.245
we can speak well of it, right?

139
00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:41.725
So we can understand how to say things

140
00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:43.485
and how to understand and speak of it.

141
00:06:43.825 --> 00:06:46.245
That's not going to denigrate God in a way.

142
00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:49.325
Even though our language is limited, we will still be able

143
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.325
to speak of it well, even though we won't fully

144
00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:52.885
grasp everything.

145
00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:54.405
So that's even with the attributes,

146
00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:56.645
anytime we talk about God, that's what we're talking about.

147
00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:59.325
There's just so much we won't understand and won't get.

148
00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:01.005
But we can know some.

149
00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:03.485
So we saw two categories of attributes.

150
00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:06.685
Remember we saw two was essential attributes

151
00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:09.845
or the incommunicable attributes of God, things

152
00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:12.285
that he doesn't share with us.

153
00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:14.685
And then we also saw the relational attributes

154
00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:17.765
or the communicable attributes, the things that he

155
00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:19.565
does share with us.

156
00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:23.045
So remember, the essential are those attributes of God

157
00:07:23.045 --> 00:07:24.645
that are essential to his being.

158
00:07:25.035 --> 00:07:29.125
They're at the core of how God works, not just how we notice

159
00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:30.725
or see or, or encounter him.

160
00:07:30.725 --> 00:07:33.125
It's just at the core of himself.

161
00:07:33.705 --> 00:07:35.405
And that means they don't translate to us.

162
00:07:35.405 --> 00:07:36.525
They're not shared with us.

163
00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:39.485
'cause it's part of the being of God.

164
00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:43.385
But the relational, the communicable attributes are those

165
00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:44.665
that describe how he relates to us.

166
00:07:44.805 --> 00:07:47.305
So the things that, that in a limited sense,

167
00:07:47.305 --> 00:07:51.745
he does share them with us, though He shows them perfectly,

168
00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:54.065
and exemp exemplifies them perfectly.

169
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.865
We will be limited in those even though we can

170
00:07:57.365 --> 00:07:58.705
relate a little bit to them.

171
00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.065
And so, again, just as, uh, illustration, what were some

172
00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:06.105
of the essential attributes, the things that he, uh,

173
00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:07.745
does not share with us.

174
00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:09.865
What were some of those? I'm gonna mention the three

175
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:11.065
that we studied on Sunday,

176
00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:13.145
but I want to give you just a, a list of others,

177
00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:17.825
other examples of, of essential attributes, various sources

178
00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:19.825
that come up with these.

179
00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:21.145
And there's lists all over the place.

180
00:08:21.165 --> 00:08:24.225
And people divide these, these are not neat categories.

181
00:08:24.255 --> 00:08:26.665
Like one are the two, like they kind

182
00:08:26.665 --> 00:08:27.745
of cross a little bit, some.

183
00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:29.425
And so there's different ways,

184
00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:30.745
but you can think about it this way.

185
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:34.265
The the other essential attributes you might think

186
00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:38.385
of would be things like immensity, that God is immense.

187
00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:40.345
That word we don't use very often,

188
00:08:40.365 --> 00:08:42.145
but it just means size, right?

189
00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:44.745
Massive beyond our comprehension.

190
00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:48.425
Immensity, immutability, it's a hard word.

191
00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:52.265
Uh, mu mutate is in there, right? Mutate change.

192
00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.105
Immutability means he doesn't change.

193
00:08:57.145 --> 00:09:00.925
Uh, he's independent. It means he has no need of anything.

194
00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:03.845
He's self-sustaining, uh, doesn't need us

195
00:09:03.985 --> 00:09:06.045
to give him anything like we saw in Acts 17.

196
00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:09.045
He's gotta feed the, the idols. God doesn't need anything.

197
00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:13.445
Unity is another incommunicable attribute of God,

198
00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:16.045
that he's one, uh, perfectly.

199
00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:18.285
And we'll see that this Sunday with the Trinity.

200
00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:24.365
He's perfect. And we, we will never reach that.

201
00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:26.485
We could never have that shared with us.

202
00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:28.685
But those are incommunicable attributes.

203
00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:34.685
Here's a, a verse one Timothy one 17 says, to the king

204
00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:38.245
of the ages, immortal, invisible,

205
00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:42.445
the only God be honor and glory forever and ever.

206
00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:44.965
He's recounting a couple things there

207
00:09:44.965 --> 00:09:46.285
that talk about God being God.

208
00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:49.005
And we're not just above all else there.

209
00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:54.645
So the three that I talked about on Sunday were omnipotence

210
00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:59.205
potent, uh, omnipotence, that he's all powerful.

211
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:01.125
He can accomplish his will. He's sovereign.

212
00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:04.245
Uh, that is that power that God has,

213
00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:05.365
that he can do anything.

214
00:10:05.515 --> 00:10:08.365
He's able to accomplish what he desires to do.

215
00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:13.605
Omnipotence, omnipresence, he's all present, located

216
00:10:14.255 --> 00:10:16.645
everywhere, fully present in every place.

217
00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:19.245
Acts 17, he's near to all.

218
00:10:19.345 --> 00:10:21.365
So there's this idea of God being everywhere

219
00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:24.925
and omniscient, all knowing.

220
00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:28.325
He knows everyone's heart, knows everyone thought

221
00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:30.405
knows the past, present, future.

222
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.565
He knows all things actual, knows all things even possible.

223
00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:36.605
So that's kind of the mind blowing part of this, is

224
00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:39.885
that God knows the potential outcome of every decision

225
00:10:39.885 --> 00:10:43.165
that could have ever been made, right?

226
00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:46.525
Like, okay, you just think about your day today, right?

227
00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.965
How many decisions you made, the implications

228
00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:50.165
of how that could play out.

229
00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:52.725
But then the next one also could play

230
00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:53.805
out in all these different ways.

231
00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:55.565
God, yeah.

232
00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:57.205
So you start to think about these things

233
00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:58.765
and it can blow your mind.

234
00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:02.285
That also means we are not open theists,

235
00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:06.485
where God is up there merely responding

236
00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:10.285
to things down here like we are, that the pipe burst

237
00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:11.965
and we're like, uhoh, we gotta fix it.

238
00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:15.285
Now what do we do? God is not working that way.

239
00:11:16.435 --> 00:11:18.245
It's not that He's learning along the way.

240
00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:20.765
He is all knowing.

241
00:11:23.635 --> 00:11:26.655
Now, remember, it is difficult, even as I said though, is

242
00:11:26.655 --> 00:11:27.775
for our mind to conceive

243
00:11:27.835 --> 00:11:32.135
how these things could actually be possible, which is okay,

244
00:11:32.135 --> 00:11:35.655
because like we saw with Job, his response to job was that,

245
00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:36.935
I'm God, you're not.

246
00:11:37.315 --> 00:11:41.815
And that's okay. So there's a measure of faith that we have

247
00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:46.495
in this, but it is okay to wrestle with the implications

248
00:11:46.635 --> 00:11:51.615
of these things, to take your questions to the Lord,

249
00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:56.245
to wonder why things play out the way they do.

250
00:11:56.355 --> 00:11:59.605
It's okay for us to, to look to God

251
00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:02.445
and say, how, how is this?

252
00:12:03.025 --> 00:12:05.165
How is this good? How is this work out?

253
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.285
How, how could this have been your plan?

254
00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:09.445
Like all of these things, it's okay to take that to God.

255
00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:14.245
Just do it. In the spirit of Richard Baxter, when he said

256
00:12:14.245 --> 00:12:15.885
that the ocean is not the ocean,

257
00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:19.245
if you can hold it in a spoon, right?

258
00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:23.565
So there there's a measure of us trying to reduce God down

259
00:12:23.565 --> 00:12:25.085
to something we can understand and grasp.

260
00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:27.765
Well then he's not God.

261
00:12:29.025 --> 00:12:32.565
So there's a measure of saying, God's your God, I have faith

262
00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:36.005
that you are in charge working your will.

263
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:39.605
Things are going to be according to your will.

264
00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:44.485
So that's part of his essential attributes, part of who He,

265
00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:45.925
of what God is, right?

266
00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:48.725
The essence of the being of God.

267
00:12:48.865 --> 00:12:50.805
But what about his relational attributes?

268
00:12:50.805 --> 00:12:52.205
Those are the things that he does

269
00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:56.365
and in part, share with us who are made in his image.

270
00:12:58.195 --> 00:13:02.755
Like if essential is what God is, omnipresent,

271
00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:06.595
omniscient, the relational attributes are who he is.

272
00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:09.275
I'll get into this on Sunday, kind

273
00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:11.355
of the persons of the Trinity.

274
00:13:11.495 --> 00:13:14.155
The, the, the way that we understand and

275
00:13:14.215 --> 00:13:17.075
and experience God, how he relates to us

276
00:13:18.335 --> 00:13:20.035
are these relational attributes.

277
00:13:20.775 --> 00:13:22.235
And I, I mentioned three on Sunday.

278
00:13:22.305 --> 00:13:23.635
I'll, I'll say those again in a moment.

279
00:13:23.695 --> 00:13:25.835
But again, another list just so you can kind

280
00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:26.995
of get an awareness of

281
00:13:26.995 --> 00:13:29.315
what these relational attributes would be.

282
00:13:29.315 --> 00:13:33.475
Various sources, but things like wisdom, again, things

283
00:13:33.475 --> 00:13:34.795
that he shares with us

284
00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:38.475
to at least a limited extent we can participate in.

285
00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:43.315
So wisdom, truth, God is truth. God is wisdom.

286
00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:44.675
God is mercy.

287
00:13:46.135 --> 00:13:48.675
God is peace, wrath

288
00:13:51.145 --> 00:13:53.405
His will, you might say, as an attribute.

289
00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:55.205
In some ways there's debate about that.

290
00:13:55.305 --> 00:13:57.685
But beauty, kindness,

291
00:13:58.145 --> 00:13:59.445
you go through the fruit of the spirit, right?

292
00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:02.845
You could even list out those as as attributes

293
00:14:02.965 --> 00:14:05.605
that he shares with us in a sense,

294
00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:07.285
even though we're not expressing them perfectly.

295
00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:10.685
He does, but, but we can a little bit as well.

296
00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:12.805
But I mentioned three on Sunday,

297
00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:15.045
and those were holiness first.

298
00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:16.845
Which again, holiness is separation.

299
00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.965
It's different from other things.

300
00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:23.205
That's what holiness is, especially from sin. God is holy.

301
00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.765
That's a separation from sin for Samuel two.

302
00:14:26.945 --> 00:14:29.165
Two, there's none holy like the Lord,

303
00:14:30.945 --> 00:14:34.445
the angels in heaven right now singing Holy, holy,

304
00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:36.045
holy is the Lord God Almighty.

305
00:14:38.275 --> 00:14:40.525
Utterly different is what they're screaming.

306
00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:43.365
You are so different than everything else. Holiness.

307
00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:48.245
Again, there's a measure of of us being able to share that.

308
00:14:48.425 --> 00:14:50.925
But, but not perfectly like he does.

309
00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:53.485
Holiness is one attribute.

310
00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:56.445
Righteousness is another attribute that is

311
00:14:57.085 --> 00:14:58.365
communicable is shared.

312
00:14:59.145 --> 00:15:01.845
And that means that God always acts with what is right.

313
00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:04.045
He always acts in accordance with what is right.

314
00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:08.405
What is just He does what is right. That's righteousness.

315
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.125
Again, we can participate in that too, right?

316
00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:14.805
We know what is right according to what God says is right.

317
00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:18.365
We can be righteous in our actions as well,

318
00:15:18.475 --> 00:15:20.125
just not like God can be.

319
00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:22.925
And then the third one I said was goodness.

320
00:15:23.435 --> 00:15:25.325
That he's the final standard of good.

321
00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.525
Everything he does is worthy of approval

322
00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:32.485
and it's good when he does it.

323
00:15:34.085 --> 00:15:36.385
And so, again, God is perfect in all those things.

324
00:15:36.445 --> 00:15:38.785
And we experience those things perfectly from him.

325
00:15:39.965 --> 00:15:42.305
We relate to him as he's perfectly holy,

326
00:15:42.305 --> 00:15:43.625
perfectly righteous, perfectly good.

327
00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:45.745
We relate to him in that way.

328
00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:48.865
But he also then calls us to be those things, right?

329
00:15:51.465 --> 00:15:54.005
Yet here's, this is where the gospel fits in here,

330
00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:56.085
because we can't do those things on our own.

331
00:15:57.025 --> 00:15:59.365
We can't create holiness and righteousness

332
00:15:59.365 --> 00:16:00.485
and goodness in ourselves.

333
00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:05.205
We can't do that. He's gracious in it that he makes us holy,

334
00:16:08.685 --> 00:16:13.355
Which leads us to obey his will in righteousness, which is

335
00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:15.235
what he calls good, right?

336
00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:19.995
You see how how that plays out, he makes us different

337
00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:23.635
so that we act differently so

338
00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:25.955
that it's good according to his standard.

339
00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:28.345
But it starts with him.

340
00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:31.505
It's, it's his initiative, initiative, initiative.

341
00:16:32.765 --> 00:16:35.225
As we go forward, what a gift of grace, right?

342
00:16:35.225 --> 00:16:38.665
That we see him work that in his people.

343
00:16:40.685 --> 00:16:42.425
So quick blast through,

344
00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:45.865
I I leaned a lot on this book along the way.

345
00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:49.065
This is a really simple book, but, but thick

346
00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:50.745
and deep in a good way.

347
00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:54.145
Uh, Gerald Bray, the attributes of God, an introduction.

348
00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:56.705
It's very simple, easy read,

349
00:16:56.925 --> 00:16:59.825
but digs a lot into this as we go forward.

350
00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.225
So this'll be down here as well.

351
00:17:01.245 --> 00:17:03.945
But, um, all the systematics

352
00:17:03.965 --> 00:17:07.745
and uh, biblical theologies down here, those kind

353
00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:09.425
of things you can look at as well later.

354
00:17:10.085 --> 00:17:11.225
But here's the thing. We know

355
00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:12.585
questions come from this stuff.

356
00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:15.265
When you start to play out implications, you start

357
00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:17.465
to think about, okay, well, God is that, well, what does

358
00:17:17.465 --> 00:17:18.465
that then imply?

359
00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:20.065
What does that mean? Okay, so

360
00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:25.305
what we should first do when anytime we talk about God

361
00:17:26.355 --> 00:17:30.385
first, there should be this awe of God, kind

362
00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:34.345
of a stunned reality that God is this okay?

363
00:17:35.015 --> 00:17:36.865
What He is who He is. Wow. Okay.

364
00:17:38.895 --> 00:17:40.545
That should be our first response.

365
00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:44.705
But then there are questions that come up, right?

366
00:17:44.765 --> 00:17:48.025
We, we do see some questions that show up along the way.

367
00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:50.005
So I invite Aaron to come up here with me.

368
00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:53.405
Now, I'm gonna ask him kind of a dialogue.

369
00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.925
We, we tweaked this from last week just a little bit,

370
00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:58.365
but I wanna ask him a couple questions about it,

371
00:17:58.885 --> 00:18:00.685
specifically about some of these A attributes,

372
00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:01.845
but also some applications.

373
00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:03.285
And we're gonna kind of dialogue here a little bit

374
00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:07.085
because I know there's questions that come up in your head

375
00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:11.525
and we want to answer those as best we can this way, uh,

376
00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:13.285
and provide some applications along the way.

377
00:18:13.285 --> 00:18:14.685
Then give you a chance, of course,

378
00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:16.285
to ask a couple questions as well.

379
00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:20.405
Uh, but, but these are, these are heavy questions.

380
00:18:20.425 --> 00:18:23.605
We start to think about how big God is.

381
00:18:24.225 --> 00:18:28.005
So let's try to, to think through it in a way that allows us

382
00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:32.285
to, um, to faithfully love God more often.

383
00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:35.365
So first, why does all this even matter?

384
00:18:35.805 --> 00:18:39.885
Like why does, why should we study these attributes?

385
00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:41.845
Why is this important? Shouldn't it be

386
00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:43.005
enough that we love Jesus?

387
00:18:43.215 --> 00:18:46.445
Right? Because I, I've heard that actually to my face.

388
00:18:46.515 --> 00:18:49.485
Like, I mean, I love Jesus. That's enough, right?

389
00:18:49.485 --> 00:18:52.445
Like, I'm getting to heaven isn't that base level.

390
00:18:53.305 --> 00:18:55.885
So why does this even matter for us to study?

391
00:18:57.755 --> 00:19:01.285
Yeah. Everything that we do in life is gonna come back

392
00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:03.965
to your view of God.

393
00:19:06.405 --> 00:19:07.445
I like to say it this way.

394
00:19:07.555 --> 00:19:10.125
Your view of God determines your view of everything else.

395
00:19:11.115 --> 00:19:15.705
Your view of yourself begins with your view of God.

396
00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:19.665
Your view of the circumstances in your life.

397
00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:23.865
Come back to your view of God, your, your view of others,

398
00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:27.665
how you perceive others, your view of the gospel.

399
00:19:28.195 --> 00:19:32.505
Everything in your life comes back to who is God.

400
00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:38.385
And so that, that question of, uh, your view

401
00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:41.385
of God, determining your view of everything else is key.

402
00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:44.705
It's one of those big rocks. We have to start with God.

403
00:19:45.405 --> 00:19:50.225
And so I love that we've gone from revelation to

404
00:19:50.885 --> 00:19:52.785
God, because you can't get to know

405
00:19:52.805 --> 00:19:55.825
who God is without first going to his word.

406
00:19:55.885 --> 00:20:00.305
And so you can know a little bit from creation.

407
00:20:00.665 --> 00:20:01.945
I think if we took some time

408
00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:04.865
and we said, how, what character qualities can you come up

409
00:20:04.865 --> 00:20:06.785
with just by looking at what he's made?

410
00:20:07.365 --> 00:20:09.145
We could come up with some character qualities,

411
00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:11.465
but you can't know them in detail, as John said,

412
00:20:11.655 --> 00:20:13.145
without going to his word.

413
00:20:13.165 --> 00:20:15.945
So I love that we've connected revelation to,

414
00:20:17.045 --> 00:20:18.425
to God's attributes.

415
00:20:18.525 --> 00:20:20.905
But again, why is this important?

416
00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:23.785
Because all the other things we talk about

417
00:20:23.875 --> 00:20:28.225
after this, uh, rock, this tear,

418
00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:32.785
this issue, are all gonna come back and hinge on who is God.

419
00:20:33.405 --> 00:20:36.695
So once, one more time, you know, your view

420
00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:38.455
of God determines your view of everything else.

421
00:20:39.035 --> 00:20:41.335
And so we have to start there.

422
00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:43.935
And, um, that's why this is important.

423
00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:48.395
Yeah. And I, I've heard that one, what comes

424
00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:51.555
to mind when you think about God is your view of God.

425
00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:56.315
So what we're trying to do with his word is

426
00:20:57.175 --> 00:20:58.955
create a picture of

427
00:20:58.975 --> 00:21:01.395
who he is when we think about who he is, right?

428
00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:03.275
You see what I mean? Like, if you think about God

429
00:21:03.275 --> 00:21:07.595
and your first thought is like aggressive tyrant,

430
00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:11.555
that's your view of who God is, then, then

431
00:21:11.555 --> 00:21:12.955
that's the way it's gonna color

432
00:21:12.955 --> 00:21:14.235
everything else in your life.

433
00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:17.915
But if you see God as passive and soft

434
00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:20.835
and just like unable to really do much of anything, kind

435
00:21:20.835 --> 00:21:23.155
of the old Jesus film where he's sitting on the rock,

436
00:21:23.185 --> 00:21:24.435
he's got conditioned hair

437
00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:26.755
and he's sitting there just like can't do anything.

438
00:21:29.095 --> 00:21:30.715
If that's your view of God, then,

439
00:21:30.715 --> 00:21:32.995
then you're also gonna hit some things in your life.

440
00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:36.805
Where can God really help? I don't know.

441
00:21:37.555 --> 00:21:38.685
Does he have the power to do that?

442
00:21:39.385 --> 00:21:40.685
So what comes to mind when you think about

443
00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:41.845
God is your view of God.

444
00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:44.685
And so we want that to be formed by God's word,

445
00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:46.805
even if it needs to adjust some

446
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.485
of our things in our heads. So

447
00:21:49.245 --> 00:21:50.965
I kept waiting for you to hit Providence.

448
00:21:51.105 --> 00:21:53.565
You never talked about the providence of God.

449
00:21:53.685 --> 00:21:55.285
I probably didn't talk about 40, so

450
00:21:55.445 --> 00:21:56.765
I know it's my favorite attribute.

451
00:21:56.765 --> 00:21:58.365
I said sovereignty, but but go ahead. Yeah,

452
00:21:58.475 --> 00:21:59.475
Yeah. My favorite attribute

453
00:21:59.475 --> 00:22:00.125
of God,

454
00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:03.405
and there's, there's the list is,

455
00:22:03.585 --> 00:22:05.925
you know, on and on and on.

456
00:22:06.105 --> 00:22:07.965
Uh, but providence of God,

457
00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:10.205
you don't see the word providence in scripture.

458
00:22:11.385 --> 00:22:15.205
Uh, but the, the idea

459
00:22:15.425 --> 00:22:18.005
of providence is all, you know, every page of the Bible.

460
00:22:18.155 --> 00:22:21.085
This idea that God works all things

461
00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:23.605
for his good, you all know that.

462
00:22:24.465 --> 00:22:26.245
But the providence of God is another.

463
00:22:26.275 --> 00:22:27.725
It's probably my favorite attribute

464
00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:30.685
because he can take all of our decisions

465
00:22:30.705 --> 00:22:32.525
and all of our actions in a day

466
00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:37.525
and somehow work them all to fulfill his purposes.

467
00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.885
And, and how he does that, I don't know.

468
00:22:40.145 --> 00:22:43.565
And that's probably why I'm so fascinated by it.

469
00:22:44.265 --> 00:22:48.045
But even the, the, the good things from your life, the,

470
00:22:48.145 --> 00:22:50.365
the things you don't understand, the things that are,

471
00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:53.325
you would consider bad, all of those things.

472
00:22:53.425 --> 00:22:56.325
He somehow works out in his plan.

473
00:22:56.345 --> 00:22:58.285
He has this plan, he has a good plan.

474
00:22:58.435 --> 00:23:01.085
He's, he's using you and his plan,

475
00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:04.885
and somehow he works all these out for, for his good.

476
00:23:05.045 --> 00:23:07.565
I think that's just, that's, to me, that is just, wow.

477
00:23:08.225 --> 00:23:10.405
You have to be God to do that.

478
00:23:11.065 --> 00:23:13.965
And so that's my favorite attribute of God.

479
00:23:15.325 --> 00:23:19.725
I actually have that, that's kind

480
00:23:19.725 --> 00:23:21.005
of a little wrap up of tonight.

481
00:23:21.065 --> 00:23:22.365
So I was looking ahead, you still,

482
00:23:23.025 --> 00:23:25.605
but it wasn't, Providence wasn't, it was Romans 8 28,

483
00:23:25.605 --> 00:23:27.605
which is, you know, that common verse that we'll talk about,

484
00:23:27.605 --> 00:23:28.605
because I wanted to kind of see

485
00:23:28.605 --> 00:23:30.525
how the questions went, but perfect.

486
00:23:30.985 --> 00:23:32.245
So let's talk about another one.

487
00:23:32.265 --> 00:23:35.285
You mentioned that one that, that I didn't mention

488
00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:36.805
or we didn't talk about on Sunday.

489
00:23:36.825 --> 00:23:39.525
At least I mentioned tonight God's immutability,

490
00:23:40.275 --> 00:23:41.445
that he doesn't change.

491
00:23:42.425 --> 00:23:45.845
Uh, so why does that matter so much to our faith?

492
00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:47.685
I mean, okay, great, God changes,

493
00:23:47.785 --> 00:23:49.245
not changes doesn't really matter.

494
00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:51.245
Why does it matter that God doesn't change?

495
00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:56.405
Uh, that's a good question. The Bible tells us God's the

496
00:23:56.405 --> 00:23:57.965
same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

497
00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:02.125
He never changes. And why is that important to

498
00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:04.325
our faith, is the question.

499
00:24:05.305 --> 00:24:09.645
Um, we're reading, uh, his word,

500
00:24:09.655 --> 00:24:11.485
which is thousands of years old,

501
00:24:11.545 --> 00:24:15.445
and he's describing himself, you know, 6,000,

502
00:24:15.545 --> 00:24:16.685
10,000 years ago.

503
00:24:18.945 --> 00:24:22.805
But he's the same God that he was then.

504
00:24:23.585 --> 00:24:27.485
And so when we read about his character

505
00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:30.885
or how he deals with people, then

506
00:24:31.515 --> 00:24:33.685
it's the same God we're dealing with today.

507
00:24:34.585 --> 00:24:35.805
He does not change.

508
00:24:36.065 --> 00:24:39.565
And so, uh, everything that,

509
00:24:40.105 --> 00:24:42.925
all these qualities, these character qualities

510
00:24:42.925 --> 00:24:44.725
of God are the same.

511
00:24:46.245 --> 00:24:49.605
Wherever God is intervening

512
00:24:50.395 --> 00:24:54.325
4,000 years ago, 2000 years ago, yesterday, today,

513
00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:57.325
and a thousand years from now, he's the same.

514
00:24:57.345 --> 00:25:02.045
And that means a lot to us who, you know,

515
00:25:02.045 --> 00:25:03.605
we readily change our minds.

516
00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:06.085
We, we readily are unfaithful.

517
00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:09.805
We change, you know, on any given day.

518
00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:15.085
But even though we are sometimes unfaithful, he is faithful

519
00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:18.525
and he is always going to be the same.

520
00:25:18.885 --> 00:25:22.045
I can trust him today to be exactly

521
00:25:22.155 --> 00:25:23.885
what he was then.

522
00:25:24.555 --> 00:25:27.005
He's the same God we sing that song on Sundays.

523
00:25:27.515 --> 00:25:31.865
He's the same God as he was then today.

524
00:25:32.005 --> 00:25:34.905
And so to me, that is the immutability of God.

525
00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:38.785
You can always trust him to be who he is,

526
00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:40.585
who he was, who he is.

527
00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:45.745
You can always trust him, always keep him at his word

528
00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:48.105
because he doesn't change.

529
00:25:48.405 --> 00:25:50.745
And to me, that's a, that's a reassurance.

530
00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:52.865
That's a, that's a confidence that we can have in our faith.

531
00:25:54.305 --> 00:25:55.745
'cause it's often said that the God

532
00:25:55.745 --> 00:25:56.905
of the Old Testament is different

533
00:25:56.905 --> 00:25:57.985
than the God of the New Testament.

534
00:25:58.245 --> 00:26:00.105
That's a, a common thought.

535
00:26:01.925 --> 00:26:04.465
No, God's the same yesterday, today, forever.

536
00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:07.185
So even though you might read it

537
00:26:07.185 --> 00:26:09.625
and think it's different, it, it's not, you have

538
00:26:09.625 --> 00:26:11.265
to take God as his whole.

539
00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:13.305
Uh, and it matters

540
00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:17.305
because then if God would change, then we have no assurance

541
00:26:17.305 --> 00:26:19.425
that at some point he might change against us,

542
00:26:20.095 --> 00:26:22.545
against his people that he's chosen and, and saved.

543
00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:24.025
He's like, ah, I'm not gonna save anymore.

544
00:26:25.665 --> 00:26:28.065
I mean, if he could change in any way that is on the table.

545
00:26:28.965 --> 00:26:31.745
So we have to believe that he's never gonna change.

546
00:26:32.015 --> 00:26:33.585
Also, here's another practical part of this.

547
00:26:35.205 --> 00:26:37.305
Second Timothy, you alluded to at two 13,

548
00:26:37.305 --> 00:26:39.305
second Timothy two 13, if we're faithless,

549
00:26:39.365 --> 00:26:40.665
he remains faithful.

550
00:26:41.845 --> 00:26:43.245
So we could have used faithful

551
00:26:43.245 --> 00:26:44.685
as another one of these attributes.

552
00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:46.205
And that's important.

553
00:26:46.365 --> 00:26:48.805
Immutability, unchangeability, he's faithful.

554
00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:52.365
That's important because there's gonna be times in our lives

555
00:26:52.365 --> 00:26:54.365
when people are unfaithful to us.

556
00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:58.165
Some of you experienced it very directly.

557
00:27:00.815 --> 00:27:04.355
We need to remember that God never will be unfaithful

558
00:27:04.355 --> 00:27:06.565
to us, right?

559
00:27:06.565 --> 00:27:09.365
So that's important. It's immutability, it's unchangeable

560
00:27:09.365 --> 00:27:10.845
that he is faithful to his people.

561
00:27:10.985 --> 00:27:13.685
He will never not be faithful to us.

562
00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:17.845
You can see how that that gets drilled down

563
00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:21.205
to a level real fast that affects our daily lives.

564
00:27:22.625 --> 00:27:24.285
So that's just another example I wanted to

565
00:27:24.285 --> 00:27:25.285
See. Yeah. And if you take the

566
00:27:25.285 --> 00:27:26.085
flip side of that

567
00:27:26.085 --> 00:27:30.525
and say God does change, he's changeable.

568
00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:33.645
You wouldn't know, you know,

569
00:27:33.645 --> 00:27:36.125
if he's different yesterday than he is today,

570
00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:39.835
and he is gonna be different tomorrow, you wouldn't be able

571
00:27:39.835 --> 00:27:41.595
to put any faith or trust in him at all

572
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:45.275
because you don't know what to expect of this God

573
00:27:45.275 --> 00:27:46.355
that changes all the time.

574
00:27:46.495 --> 00:27:50.275
So, one more time, it, it is just a,

575
00:27:50.345 --> 00:27:54.875
it's a reassuring, uh, wonderful truth that,

576
00:27:55.385 --> 00:27:57.115
that, that God will never change

577
00:27:57.295 --> 00:27:58.355
and we can trust

578
00:27:58.505 --> 00:28:00.955
that he will never change in the future as well.

579
00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:02.315
Hmm.

580
00:28:02.655 --> 00:28:03.835
So here's another common question

581
00:28:03.905 --> 00:28:05.115
I've received over the years.

582
00:28:06.015 --> 00:28:07.875
God is described as jealous.

583
00:28:09.175 --> 00:28:13.555
That's a, an attribute of God, probably communicable.

584
00:28:13.615 --> 00:28:15.115
We might say that he could, that we can get

585
00:28:15.115 --> 00:28:16.315
jealous as well, right?

586
00:28:16.975 --> 00:28:21.755
So if God is jealous, does that, like what does that mean?

587
00:28:21.755 --> 00:28:25.275
First of all, does that give us license

588
00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:26.875
to be jealous as well?

589
00:28:28.655 --> 00:28:30.675
And then how does that show up in our lives?

590
00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:32.715
Like the proper way we would view jealousy.

591
00:28:32.735 --> 00:28:34.915
So God is jealous. What does that mean?

592
00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:36.255
How does it play out?

593
00:28:37.585 --> 00:28:40.395
It's really a dangerous thing to compare

594
00:28:41.215 --> 00:28:43.395
how we express these attributes

595
00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:45.115
and how he expresses these attributes.

596
00:28:45.135 --> 00:28:48.875
That's good. Um, we are loving,

597
00:28:49.015 --> 00:28:52.355
but our love is nothing really compared to his love.

598
00:28:52.365 --> 00:28:55.715
We're, we're faithful at times. He's always faithful.

599
00:28:56.175 --> 00:28:57.995
So it's, it's, you have

600
00:28:57.995 --> 00:28:59.475
to be really careful when you compare

601
00:29:00.335 --> 00:29:02.075
our attributes to his attributes.

602
00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:05.315
'cause he, we are sinful fall and he is not.

603
00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:08.835
So to say God is jealous is just to repeat

604
00:29:08.835 --> 00:29:10.035
what he said of himself, right?

605
00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:12.955
Um, I believe Exodus 20,

606
00:29:13.425 --> 00:29:16.195
he's telling his people 10 commandments, not

607
00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:18.875
to worship idols because I'm a jealous God.

608
00:29:18.895 --> 00:29:21.115
He says, uh,

609
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:24.335
okay, time out.

610
00:29:24.495 --> 00:29:29.135
I thought jealousy was a sin. How can he be a jealous God?

611
00:29:30.085 --> 00:29:33.735
Well, we have to be really careful there, uh, to be jealous.

612
00:29:34.835 --> 00:29:38.655
If, if we are jealous, we are, uh, what's the word?

613
00:29:38.655 --> 00:29:41.725
We're, we're envious of what other people might have

614
00:29:42.025 --> 00:29:44.445
or what, what they can do that we can't do.

615
00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:47.885
We have a fear of inferiority to them.

616
00:29:48.025 --> 00:29:51.845
For some reason, God is not jealous like that.

617
00:29:51.945 --> 00:29:55.685
He, there's nothing anybody has that he needs or wants.

618
00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:58.085
And there's nothing that anybody can do that he can't do.

619
00:29:58.945 --> 00:30:00.605
So he's not jealous in the way

620
00:30:00.605 --> 00:30:01.885
that you and I would be jealous.

621
00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:06.325
The way that we need to think about his jealousy is,

622
00:30:07.465 --> 00:30:11.525
and why he, I think relates it to idols is we are worship.

623
00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:13.885
He we're told not to worship idols

624
00:30:13.885 --> 00:30:18.405
because worship belongs to him, not to anything else.

625
00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:23.085
And so he's jealous for our worship.

626
00:30:23.465 --> 00:30:27.845
He, he is jealous for our love, our service, our honor.

627
00:30:28.345 --> 00:30:30.805
And when we worship an idol, we are giving

628
00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:33.605
to the idol something that belongs to God.

629
00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:37.325
So he's jealous. A good way to think about this is a husband

630
00:30:38.095 --> 00:30:39.805
being jealous for his wife.

631
00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:43.365
He sees another man flirting with his wife.

632
00:30:44.265 --> 00:30:47.725
He is jealous for her because she,

633
00:30:48.505 --> 00:30:50.485
and you know, according to the covenant

634
00:30:50.505 --> 00:30:52.005
of marriage belongs to him.

635
00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:56.085
He's jealous. Is that a sinful jealousy

636
00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:57.605
or is that a righteous jealousy?

637
00:30:58.505 --> 00:31:01.405
God is jealous in a righteous way.

638
00:31:01.585 --> 00:31:03.405
Not, not a fallen, sinful way.

639
00:31:03.505 --> 00:31:07.325
So, uh, he's jealous for that which belongs to him, glory,

640
00:31:07.915 --> 00:31:10.245
worship, honor, if that makes sense.

641
00:31:10.745 --> 00:31:11.765
So it's not quite the same.

642
00:31:11.835 --> 00:31:16.165
Yeah. And there's no higher good for us to terminate

643
00:31:17.065 --> 00:31:18.285
our worship on.

644
00:31:18.505 --> 00:31:19.925
And so he knows that's the way

645
00:31:19.925 --> 00:31:21.245
he designed it to be that way.

646
00:31:21.505 --> 00:31:25.245
So then we, when we give that which is designed

647
00:31:25.245 --> 00:31:28.525
to terminate on him to anything else, it's futile

648
00:31:28.525 --> 00:31:29.805
and it's lesser.

649
00:31:30.635 --> 00:31:33.645
Instead of it being designed the way it was

650
00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:36.005
and it going that direction, God is jealous.

651
00:31:36.225 --> 00:31:40.125
He longs for that, doesn't need it, but he longs for, uh,

652
00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:42.965
because that's the way we then experience the most

653
00:31:43.355 --> 00:31:46.965
fulfillment, quote unquote in life, is by doing exactly

654
00:31:46.995 --> 00:31:48.285
what God designed us to do.

655
00:31:48.745 --> 00:31:50.085
So he's jealous in that.

656
00:31:50.105 --> 00:31:53.165
And we give it to any idolatry, it'll lead us asray.

657
00:31:54.385 --> 00:31:56.245
Here's another one before we, uh, get

658
00:31:56.245 --> 00:31:58.365
to some questions you might have as we thinking of those,

659
00:31:58.975 --> 00:32:01.565
we've got, uh, Mike's stands by the way.

660
00:32:01.865 --> 00:32:05.925
So one John four, eight says, God is love,

661
00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:10.365
so love attribute of God, something we can express

662
00:32:10.625 --> 00:32:13.845
to a limited extent, not perfectly like he does.

663
00:32:13.955 --> 00:32:15.045
It's not the same thing.

664
00:32:16.185 --> 00:32:20.685
But what does that mean for our relationship with him first?

665
00:32:20.755 --> 00:32:23.845
Like God is love. So what does that mean for us with him?

666
00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:26.765
But then how does it change the way we treat others?

667
00:32:26.905 --> 00:32:31.245
If it's a communicable attribute, God is love.

668
00:32:31.995 --> 00:32:33.565
Does that look vertically with him?

669
00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:36.085
And then how does it play out horizontally?

670
00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:39.605
Yeah. I love that he says God is love

671
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:41.405
and he, it is not that God is loving,

672
00:32:43.465 --> 00:32:44.765
God is love.

673
00:32:44.995 --> 00:32:46.925
He's the standard for love.

674
00:32:47.145 --> 00:32:50.045
He is the, he is love.

675
00:32:50.545 --> 00:32:54.645
He, uh, exhibits love and all that he does.

676
00:32:54.795 --> 00:32:56.485
Love is his character.

677
00:32:56.975 --> 00:33:01.285
Everything that God does is permeated by his love.

678
00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:03.925
It's not just that he loves every now and then He's loving,

679
00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:06.525
but everything he does is love.

680
00:33:07.145 --> 00:33:10.605
So when you think of it that way, then those things

681
00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:14.335
that happen in our lives, if you,

682
00:33:14.355 --> 00:33:16.335
if you know God is love

683
00:33:16.475 --> 00:33:18.295
and everything he does is loving,

684
00:33:18.485 --> 00:33:22.055
then even those hard things that happen to us in life,

685
00:33:22.235 --> 00:33:25.855
we know that God is working this out for my good,

686
00:33:25.875 --> 00:33:28.335
but he does it also and he allows it in love.

687
00:33:29.035 --> 00:33:32.135
And so I can always trust that God is love

688
00:33:34.285 --> 00:33:38.415
despite what we may go through here, uh, in our lives.

689
00:33:39.195 --> 00:33:43.095
Second thought I have on that is, you know, John asked

690
00:33:43.095 --> 00:33:45.615
how does it relate to, to us vertically

691
00:33:45.635 --> 00:33:47.015
and then to to others.

692
00:33:47.805 --> 00:33:51.655
He's the standard for love. And his love was demonstrated.

693
00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:54.535
The Bible says over and over again that God

694
00:33:54.635 --> 00:33:57.695
so loved the world that he gave his son, right?

695
00:33:58.435 --> 00:34:00.015
He demonstrated his love for us.

696
00:34:00.075 --> 00:34:03.535
And that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

697
00:34:03.715 --> 00:34:08.015
His love is, is on a level that you

698
00:34:08.015 --> 00:34:09.615
and I can't even fathom.

699
00:34:10.955 --> 00:34:13.535
He loves us with an everlasting love.

700
00:34:13.535 --> 00:34:16.535
And he loves us so much that he gave his son for us

701
00:34:17.195 --> 00:34:21.295
unconditionally, freely, without

702
00:34:22.925 --> 00:34:25.865
any, uh, you know, we did not earn it.

703
00:34:26.805 --> 00:34:29.185
And so this love is a love that you

704
00:34:29.285 --> 00:34:33.225
and I, um, we struggled to to practice.

705
00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.825
He demonstrated his love by giving his son

706
00:34:35.885 --> 00:34:37.305
to forgive us of our sins.

707
00:34:37.605 --> 00:34:40.185
But now when we come to know Christ,

708
00:34:40.325 --> 00:34:42.345
he lives in us through his spirit.

709
00:34:42.725 --> 00:34:46.465
Now, God who is love lives in us

710
00:34:46.605 --> 00:34:49.025
and allows us to love others through us.

711
00:34:49.975 --> 00:34:52.945
Okay? So now we, he is communicating that love,

712
00:34:53.815 --> 00:34:54.945
that attribute with us,

713
00:34:54.965 --> 00:34:57.705
and we can love others, uh, through his spirit.

714
00:34:57.885 --> 00:35:01.105
So, um, that's a love that, that you

715
00:35:01.105 --> 00:35:04.065
and I just, we don't, we can't do in our own flesh.

716
00:35:04.175 --> 00:35:05.345
It's an unconditional love.

717
00:35:05.345 --> 00:35:08.145
It's, it's loving those who are unlovable.

718
00:35:08.965 --> 00:35:11.785
Uh, you know, those who don't deserve to be loved.

719
00:35:12.885 --> 00:35:15.105
That's a different kind of love. Agape love.

720
00:35:15.105 --> 00:35:19.225
You guys know that only God can enable us to do

721
00:35:19.225 --> 00:35:22.225
because he is love and he lives through us in his spirit.

722
00:35:22.885 --> 00:35:27.065
Uh, that it's a, it's another level of love that you

723
00:35:27.065 --> 00:35:29.905
and I cannot do apart from his,

724
00:35:30.605 --> 00:35:32.345
um, indwelling us.

725
00:35:32.925 --> 00:35:34.065
And so anyway, those were

726
00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.105
a couple thoughts that came to mind.

727
00:35:35.455 --> 00:35:36.745
Yeah, I love the definition

728
00:35:36.855 --> 00:35:41.085
Paul Tripp gives of love, which is willing self-sacrifice

729
00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:45.935
for the good of another even when they don't deserve it.

730
00:35:46.515 --> 00:35:48.175
And even when they could never pay you back.

731
00:35:50.005 --> 00:35:54.985
So think about God is love willing self-sacrifice

732
00:35:56.085 --> 00:35:59.625
for the good of another even when they don't deserve it.

733
00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:01.825
And even when they can never pay you back.

734
00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:05.625
So there's no way we could pay God back.

735
00:36:06.215 --> 00:36:10.385
There's no way we could deserve his love.

736
00:36:11.445 --> 00:36:16.035
And yet for our good, he willingly

737
00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:18.395
sacrificed himself, right?

738
00:36:18.415 --> 00:36:21.155
So that's, that's the picture. God is love.

739
00:36:21.295 --> 00:36:22.395
That's what he is.

740
00:36:23.935 --> 00:36:28.355
And then he says, love your neighbor as yourself

741
00:36:29.185 --> 00:36:30.395
with the same word, right?

742
00:36:30.415 --> 00:36:32.075
The same idea. Love God with everything you are.

743
00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:35.515
And then one John four says, not that we've loved God,

744
00:36:35.515 --> 00:36:37.395
but that he loved us and gave himself for us.

745
00:36:38.185 --> 00:36:40.875
Then he says the very next verse, love your neighbor.

746
00:36:42.345 --> 00:36:46.675
It's like, so the picture of what he does for us is then

747
00:36:46.675 --> 00:36:49.315
how we are to go love others in the willing,

748
00:36:49.495 --> 00:36:51.675
self-sacrificial way for their good,

749
00:36:51.825 --> 00:36:53.075
even when they don't deserve it.

750
00:36:53.295 --> 00:36:54.595
That's true love, right? It's not

751
00:36:54.595 --> 00:36:55.915
that you're just transactionally

752
00:36:55.915 --> 00:36:56.995
trying to get something back.

753
00:36:58.265 --> 00:36:59.755
It's like, you could never pay me

754
00:36:59.755 --> 00:37:01.195
back and you don't deserve this.

755
00:37:02.305 --> 00:37:05.705
I love you. Anyway, that's love. It's a great picture.

756
00:37:07.295 --> 00:37:10.505
Okay, so you have some questions, I would imagine.

757
00:37:11.245 --> 00:37:14.145
And so, uh, I've got one thing to close with, but,

758
00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:16.545
but really want to open it up for questions.

759
00:37:16.545 --> 00:37:18.745
There's a mic over here. There's a mic over here.

760
00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:21.865
Everybody loves public speaking. I know.

761
00:37:22.205 --> 00:37:26.665
So, um, feel free to jump up there and ask

762
00:37:27.725 --> 00:37:30.025
or maybe tell somebody else and they'll go ask for you.

763
00:37:30.185 --> 00:37:33.385
I don't know the reality. There's no dumb questions, right?

764
00:37:33.945 --> 00:37:36.185
Honestly, this, this is, we're way up here.

765
00:37:36.405 --> 00:37:41.145
So yeah, go for it. Is it on now?

766
00:37:41.145 --> 00:37:43.905
It's, yeah. Hi.

767
00:37:43.975 --> 00:37:46.785
Yeah. Alright. Uh, Jesus said that if you love me,

768
00:37:47.005 --> 00:37:48.225
you'll obey my commands.

769
00:37:48.845 --> 00:37:51.145
So can you talk about one attribute

770
00:37:51.605 --> 00:37:54.265
and another attribute kind of combining

771
00:37:56.485 --> 00:37:58.505
You mean com What do you mean combining or

772
00:37:58.965 --> 00:38:00.985
One attribute following another attribute?

773
00:38:01.805 --> 00:38:03.665
So the the, you're saying love

774
00:38:03.885 --> 00:38:05.065
and then the second attribute is

775
00:38:05.135 --> 00:38:06.135
Righteousness. If

776
00:38:06.135 --> 00:38:07.905
you, if you love, if you love me,

777
00:38:08.165 --> 00:38:09.665
you'll obey my commands.

778
00:38:10.645 --> 00:38:13.545
So love and obedience two

779
00:38:13.545 --> 00:38:15.665
attributes that come together.

780
00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:22.385
Yeah. So I would say all of these, so in the godhead,

781
00:38:22.755 --> 00:38:24.185
again, like, what was the quote?

782
00:38:24.685 --> 00:38:28.385
Um, each describes his total being.

783
00:38:28.485 --> 00:38:30.985
He is all love, all mercy, all omnipotence,

784
00:38:31.085 --> 00:38:33.385
so on all the time, like not components.

785
00:38:34.255 --> 00:38:36.365
He's love. And then it's next.

786
00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:38.565
It's this, it's, he's all that all the time.

787
00:38:38.665 --> 00:38:40.645
So really when you think about it, it's,

788
00:38:41.675 --> 00:38:44.965
he's comprehensively all of these things at the same time.

789
00:38:46.665 --> 00:38:51.085
We can't necessarily imitate that as humans,

790
00:38:52.545 --> 00:38:56.925
but you have to say there's a bit of blending that we,

791
00:38:57.205 --> 00:38:59.125
'cause if, if you look at the fruit of the spirit,

792
00:38:59.145 --> 00:39:02.365
for example, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

793
00:39:02.365 --> 00:39:03.925
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

794
00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:08.515
Galatians five, When he says the fruit,

795
00:39:08.855 --> 00:39:10.475
that's a singular word.

796
00:39:11.745 --> 00:39:15.165
So he's not saying the fruits of the spirit

797
00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:16.965
are these nine things.

798
00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:19.725
And that's all the fruit

799
00:39:19.725 --> 00:39:22.245
of the spirit are things like these nine things.

800
00:39:22.505 --> 00:39:24.245
And they all come together.

801
00:39:25.585 --> 00:39:28.725
Now, you might not grow in all of these equally,

802
00:39:28.945 --> 00:39:30.605
you might say, because we're, you know,

803
00:39:30.605 --> 00:39:31.725
we're sinful, fallen humans.

804
00:39:31.825 --> 00:39:36.165
But, but there's a measure of, as I go towards Christ,

805
00:39:36.715 --> 00:39:40.125
into the image of Christ who did those perfectly,

806
00:39:40.405 --> 00:39:42.805
I will exemplify those perfectly.

807
00:39:42.865 --> 00:39:44.925
So that's the kind of the essence there of

808
00:39:45.145 --> 00:39:47.925
as you grow in love vertically,

809
00:39:49.155 --> 00:39:51.165
they all could, what's the phrase?

810
00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:54.555
Um, all boats rise when the

811
00:39:54.555 --> 00:39:55.755
water rises or something like that.

812
00:39:55.755 --> 00:39:57.115
What is that phrase? Somebody know?

813
00:39:57.935 --> 00:40:00.955
Um, the water rise when the tide comes in,

814
00:40:00.955 --> 00:40:02.475
all the boats rise or something like that.

815
00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:05.075
I, I don't know, probably something my grandpa

816
00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:06.435
said one day, I can't remember.

817
00:40:07.215 --> 00:40:10.755
But the idea is that they all kind

818
00:40:10.755 --> 00:40:13.155
of grow towards christlikeness together.

819
00:40:13.285 --> 00:40:15.875
Maybe not perfectly equally 'cause we're limited, but

820
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:18.475
but you can see how there could be a measure of, yeah,

821
00:40:18.475 --> 00:40:19.675
as we grow in our love for God,

822
00:40:19.675 --> 00:40:21.075
we're naturally gonna grow in our obedience

823
00:40:21.075 --> 00:40:22.195
towards God, our righteousness.

824
00:40:22.195 --> 00:40:23.395
That's what the holiness, righteousness

825
00:40:23.415 --> 00:40:26.475
and goodness comes together to show some of that

826
00:40:26.495 --> 00:40:30.755
as we grow in our holiness, as God makes us holier,

827
00:40:31.885 --> 00:40:33.875
we're gonna naturally be more righteous in

828
00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:34.915
the way we choose to live our lives.

829
00:40:34.935 --> 00:40:39.275
So yeah, I'd see that. That's good. What else?

830
00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:47.915
He's got one. Dallas, you can just go stand in line there.

831
00:40:48.305 --> 00:40:49.305
It's fine.

832
00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:53.395
Hi. Uh oh.

833
00:40:54.455 --> 00:40:57.675
So I'm aware that the enemy comes

834
00:40:57.695 --> 00:40:59.715
to steal, kill, and destroy.

835
00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:03.755
And I'm also very much aware that the way the enemy attacks

836
00:41:04.355 --> 00:41:08.075
Americans is different from how he attacks people in Asia,

837
00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:10.635
different from how he attacks people back home,

838
00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:14.915
where I'm from and since God is the same yesterday, today

839
00:41:14.915 --> 00:41:18.995
and forever, and he never changes, how does he minister

840
00:41:19.015 --> 00:41:23.555
to these different tactics, the enemy, this place?

841
00:41:24.455 --> 00:41:25.635
How does he fight against the

842
00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:27.115
different tactics as the enemy?

843
00:41:27.115 --> 00:41:28.995
Yes. Yeah, yeah. Good question.

844
00:41:33.045 --> 00:41:35.045
I, I think I understand the question.

845
00:41:35.625 --> 00:41:37.605
Uh, the enemy attacks us in different

846
00:41:37.825 --> 00:41:38.965
yes ways in different places,

847
00:41:38.965 --> 00:41:40.205
Different times of history,

848
00:41:40.205 --> 00:41:42.085
different ways, different temptations. Yeah.

849
00:41:42.425 --> 00:41:47.365
How does God's immutability, uh, apply to

850
00:41:47.365 --> 00:41:52.265
that maybe I think, uh,

851
00:41:52.685 --> 00:41:55.265
if I'm understanding the question, um,

852
00:41:57.285 --> 00:41:59.945
it doesn't matter what country you're in.

853
00:42:00.085 --> 00:42:01.825
We all experience the same.

854
00:42:02.165 --> 00:42:04.945
We, we all are in our nature the same.

855
00:42:06.005 --> 00:42:08.265
Yes, the enemy may use different tactics.

856
00:42:08.895 --> 00:42:13.485
Well, I don't even wanna say that things that apply,

857
00:42:13.585 --> 00:42:15.805
things that appeal to Americans may not appeal

858
00:42:15.865 --> 00:42:17.845
to people in other countries.

859
00:42:18.495 --> 00:42:21.525
Lemme say it that way. But the temptations are the same.

860
00:42:22.505 --> 00:42:26.845
So we have to go from all these various nations and peoples

861
00:42:26.845 --> 00:42:29.885
and tribes and how Satan might attack them,

862
00:42:30.105 --> 00:42:31.725
but go underneath the surface.

863
00:42:33.385 --> 00:42:38.085
We are all still very much the same with a fallen nature

864
00:42:38.265 --> 00:42:40.645
and therefore temptation appeals to all

865
00:42:40.645 --> 00:42:41.965
of us in the same way.

866
00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:47.205
And so, um, I hope that makes sense.

867
00:42:48.865 --> 00:42:51.525
Uh, nothing has changed about human nature

868
00:42:51.815 --> 00:42:53.125
since the beginning of time.

869
00:42:54.185 --> 00:42:58.365
And so we are all very much, uh, prone to

870
00:42:59.345 --> 00:43:01.845
to do evil, to to be tempted to sin.

871
00:43:02.545 --> 00:43:05.245
And so his tactics might be a little,

872
00:43:05.245 --> 00:43:06.685
his strategies might be a little different,

873
00:43:06.685 --> 00:43:11.405
but what I'm saying is down underneath those is still

874
00:43:12.755 --> 00:43:14.325
lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes,

875
00:43:14.385 --> 00:43:15.605
the boastful pride of life.

876
00:43:15.605 --> 00:43:18.285
They're all the same no matter what country you're in.

877
00:43:18.655 --> 00:43:20.965
Those are the same temptations. Uh,

878
00:43:22.385 --> 00:43:23.805
And there's nothing new under the sun. Does

879
00:43:23.805 --> 00:43:24.405
That make sense? There's

880
00:43:24.405 --> 00:43:25.405
Nothing new under the sun either. So

881
00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:28.205
nothing new under the sun. So, so like, yeah,

882
00:43:28.265 --> 00:43:29.485
it might play out a little differently

883
00:43:29.645 --> 00:43:31.845
'cause they didn't have Facebook 2000 years ago.

884
00:43:32.155 --> 00:43:34.485
Okay, so would

885
00:43:34.485 --> 00:43:36.805
that be considered a different tactic, a new temptation?

886
00:43:36.955 --> 00:43:41.325
Well, vanity, right? That's not new.

887
00:43:42.225 --> 00:43:47.205
Uh, you've got the temptation towards distraction and lust

888
00:43:47.205 --> 00:43:48.925
and that's all been there.

889
00:43:49.275 --> 00:43:52.365
Plus I was the Lord brought to mind Hebrews four

890
00:43:53.185 --> 00:43:55.805
for we do not have a high priest who's unable to sympathize

891
00:43:55.805 --> 00:43:57.645
with our weaknesses, but one

892
00:43:57.645 --> 00:43:59.805
who in every respect has been tempted as we are

893
00:44:00.065 --> 00:44:01.125
yet without sin.

894
00:44:02.425 --> 00:44:05.525
So if there are new temptations of some sort now

895
00:44:06.115 --> 00:44:09.645
that Jesus never faced, then we've got a problem here.

896
00:44:11.105 --> 00:44:15.605
So the essence of each temptation, so to speak, was there

897
00:44:15.795 --> 00:44:18.965
that Jesus would have overcome on our behalf

898
00:44:20.425 --> 00:44:24.445
now plays out differently in the form of

899
00:44:24.445 --> 00:44:26.605
what we see in our faces every day.

900
00:44:27.545 --> 00:44:29.925
But the essence of the temptation was the same.

901
00:44:30.105 --> 00:44:32.245
So I think he, he's,

902
00:44:32.275 --> 00:44:34.005
he's not surprised by anything the enemy's doing.

903
00:44:34.785 --> 00:44:37.125
He, he's got him on a leash like the whole thing, right?

904
00:44:37.145 --> 00:44:39.245
So I think there's a measure of confidence

905
00:44:39.245 --> 00:44:41.685
that the enemy's not gonna toss something in our way

906
00:44:41.685 --> 00:44:45.605
that's gonna be like, oh no, there's no way this got,

907
00:44:45.605 --> 00:44:47.045
are you, you got, are you sure you got this one too?

908
00:44:47.145 --> 00:44:50.645
Or We're good. He's got it and he's overcome it.

909
00:44:51.425 --> 00:44:53.045
Did that answer your question, nee?

910
00:44:53.305 --> 00:44:56.085
Yes, it did. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Alright Dallas.

911
00:44:59.085 --> 00:45:00.815
Alright. Uh, so my question is

912
00:45:00.815 --> 00:45:02.415
regarding providence of God.

913
00:45:02.915 --> 00:45:05.335
Um, if God is completely sovereign over everything in his

914
00:45:05.655 --> 00:45:08.255
creation, how should we view God in regards

915
00:45:08.275 --> 00:45:11.415
to sinful choices humans make if he is in control

916
00:45:11.415 --> 00:45:13.455
of everything and incapable of sinning?

917
00:45:14.335 --> 00:45:15.995
Hmm, that's a great question.

918
00:45:17.595 --> 00:45:21.615
So when you say the providence of God, sinful choices

919
00:45:21.835 --> 00:45:23.735
by humans that affect and hurt them

920
00:45:23.755 --> 00:45:27.495
or others, how do we still square that

921
00:45:27.495 --> 00:45:28.895
with God's providence,

922
00:45:29.265 --> 00:45:30.265
Right? Um,

923
00:45:30.265 --> 00:45:32.455
if humans make choices that hurt other humans

924
00:45:32.555 --> 00:45:35.695
and then God is sovereign over everything in his creation,

925
00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:38.455
um, how should we view him in regards to that?

926
00:45:38.565 --> 00:45:41.375
Some people may think that is God causing people

927
00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:42.695
to do bad things, but we also know

928
00:45:42.695 --> 00:45:44.415
that God is incapable of sinning.

929
00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:47.215
How should we view Jesus in light of that? Yeah,

930
00:45:47.585 --> 00:45:48.585
Great question.

931
00:45:50.775 --> 00:45:52.265
Yeah, that's, that's a good question.

932
00:45:52.485 --> 00:45:56.305
Uh, we still, God is sovereign. He's over all things.

933
00:45:57.495 --> 00:45:59.385
He's also all knowing.

934
00:45:59.525 --> 00:46:01.425
So he knows the decisions that we're gonna make.

935
00:46:02.645 --> 00:46:07.585
Um, he has allowed us, uh, some level

936
00:46:07.845 --> 00:46:08.985
of freedom of choice.

937
00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:13.025
Uh, Adam and Eve immediately had freedom of choice.

938
00:46:14.645 --> 00:46:18.105
He knew Adam and Eve would choose one way or another,

939
00:46:19.125 --> 00:46:21.745
and yet he allowed that.

940
00:46:21.765 --> 00:46:25.345
That's another aspect of his love to allow us the freedom

941
00:46:25.365 --> 00:46:29.225
of choice is to express love to us.

942
00:46:29.405 --> 00:46:31.825
You can have either one of these, even knowing

943
00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:33.185
that we might choose wrong,

944
00:46:35.695 --> 00:46:37.155
yet God is sovereign

945
00:46:37.155 --> 00:46:41.255
and able to use our choices, even freedom

946
00:46:41.275 --> 00:46:43.815
of choice in this matter of sinning.

947
00:46:44.765 --> 00:46:46.495
He's able to use that for his good.

948
00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:48.255
Again, I don't know how he does that,

949
00:46:49.715 --> 00:46:54.615
but, uh, Genesis chapter 50, Joseph is,

950
00:46:55.075 --> 00:46:57.535
uh, you know, you know the story of Joseph thrown in slavery

951
00:46:57.635 --> 00:46:59.975
and ends up high position in Egypt.

952
00:47:00.155 --> 00:47:03.335
And after his father died, his brothers came to him

953
00:47:03.435 --> 00:47:06.055
and they were worried that Joseph was going to

954
00:47:07.335 --> 00:47:09.975
avenge all these terrible things that had happened to him.

955
00:47:10.075 --> 00:47:11.775
And he brought his brothers in

956
00:47:11.775 --> 00:47:14.615
and he said this, look what you meant for evil.

957
00:47:15.995 --> 00:47:18.575
You threw me in a pit, sold me into slavery.

958
00:47:18.845 --> 00:47:22.695
What you did, what you chose and meant for evil.

959
00:47:23.045 --> 00:47:27.255
Genesis 50 20, God has used it for good.

960
00:47:28.405 --> 00:47:31.805
And we see that played out on every page of scripture.

961
00:47:32.705 --> 00:47:34.245
Man makes terrible choices,

962
00:47:34.945 --> 00:47:38.005
yet God is sovereign even over our choices.

963
00:47:39.145 --> 00:47:40.565
You can even roll dice.

964
00:47:40.665 --> 00:47:43.605
The Bible says, and God is in its decision

965
00:47:45.795 --> 00:47:48.405
that takes a God that's sovereign to do that.

966
00:47:49.345 --> 00:47:51.565
And how he does it, I don't know,

967
00:47:51.665 --> 00:47:55.125
but every one of us, he's given us the freedom to choose

968
00:47:56.695 --> 00:48:00.885
every day multiple choices, good, bad or ugly.

969
00:48:01.145 --> 00:48:03.005
And he's able to use 'em for good.

970
00:48:03.105 --> 00:48:07.885
So there is freedom in the decisions

971
00:48:08.945 --> 00:48:13.125
and yet God is sovereign and providential

972
00:48:13.125 --> 00:48:16.525
and he's bringing about good how he does that, I don't know.

973
00:48:16.525 --> 00:48:19.485
And that's why I stand in awe of his providence.

974
00:48:20.795 --> 00:48:23.405
Yeah, Genesis 50 20 says, as for you,

975
00:48:23.625 --> 00:48:25.165
you meant evil against me.

976
00:48:25.585 --> 00:48:28.605
But God meant it for good to bring it about

977
00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:31.845
that many people should be kept alive as they are today.

978
00:48:33.105 --> 00:48:36.485
So that's a tough one to know that. Yeah.

979
00:48:37.475 --> 00:48:38.895
And it's the, it's the question of evil.

980
00:48:40.645 --> 00:48:43.535
Everybody asks it, we should ask it,

981
00:48:46.515 --> 00:48:50.095
but it says what you intended for evil,

982
00:48:50.155 --> 00:48:52.295
God actually meant for good.

983
00:48:53.315 --> 00:48:54.695
Now we have to wrestle with that

984
00:48:54.695 --> 00:48:56.455
because then we look at things, well it's not fair

985
00:48:56.455 --> 00:48:57.735
that they're suffering or I'm suffering,

986
00:48:57.735 --> 00:48:59.455
or somebody else is suffering because of this.

987
00:49:00.645 --> 00:49:03.055
Well, we don't know what God is gonna do with it.

988
00:49:04.435 --> 00:49:06.695
It leads me to this, this last section of

989
00:49:06.695 --> 00:49:07.775
what I was gonna say here.

990
00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:11.335
Uh, 'cause it gets to a lot of the questions about

991
00:49:13.255 --> 00:49:16.135
concentration camps, seemingly early deaths, cancer

992
00:49:16.765 --> 00:49:17.855
wars like, okay.

993
00:49:18.675 --> 00:49:20.935
And, and Aaron said it a couple times, we all did.

994
00:49:21.015 --> 00:49:25.215
I said it earlier. Romans 8 28 says, for those who love God,

995
00:49:25.275 --> 00:49:27.535
all things work together for good, for those

996
00:49:27.535 --> 00:49:28.935
who are called according to his purpose.

997
00:49:30.555 --> 00:49:31.855
Now, for those who don't love God,

998
00:49:31.865 --> 00:49:33.215
let's just take the implication of that.

999
00:49:35.455 --> 00:49:36.715
It doesn't say anything about that

1000
00:49:36.715 --> 00:49:37.755
working out for good for them.

1001
00:49:38.465 --> 00:49:40.835
Okay? So we, we just let that sit.

1002
00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:43.675
But for those who love God, all things work together

1003
00:49:43.695 --> 00:49:45.515
for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.

1004
00:49:46.255 --> 00:49:47.755
And so it's so familiar to us

1005
00:49:47.815 --> 00:49:51.475
and it, if you're in the middle of suffering, like if,

1006
00:49:51.475 --> 00:49:55.475
if I'm suffering with my kid, cancer, whatever it is,

1007
00:49:55.935 --> 00:49:58.595
and you walk in and say, Hey, Romans 8 28 man,

1008
00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:00.195
like God's gonna work this for good.

1009
00:50:00.425 --> 00:50:02.555
That sounds really trite in the moment, doesn't it?

1010
00:50:03.655 --> 00:50:05.755
It sounds kind of like,

1011
00:50:06.645 --> 00:50:10.275
don't you see like this is a lot heavier than that it seems.

1012
00:50:11.735 --> 00:50:14.195
So I read an article this week that challenged us

1013
00:50:14.215 --> 00:50:18.075
to think about a world that doesn't have Romans 8 28,

1014
00:50:19.105 --> 00:50:20.795
that Romans 8 28 doesn't exist.

1015
00:50:21.025 --> 00:50:24.195
Just imagine that for a second. Listen to this.

1016
00:50:24.195 --> 00:50:25.715
It's, I'm gonna read a a a lot,

1017
00:50:25.815 --> 00:50:28.645
but it's gonna be, I think, helpful for this conversation.

1018
00:50:29.475 --> 00:50:33.845
Without Romans 8 28, we would not have confidence

1019
00:50:33.845 --> 00:50:36.245
that our experiences in this world work for good.

1020
00:50:37.025 --> 00:50:39.165
We might believe that some of what we experience works

1021
00:50:39.225 --> 00:50:41.125
for harm, that Satan

1022
00:50:41.125 --> 00:50:43.765
and God are cosmically, slugging it out with first one

1023
00:50:43.765 --> 00:50:45.605
and then the other gaining the upper hand.

1024
00:50:46.985 --> 00:50:48.605
We might be tempted to believe that some of

1025
00:50:48.605 --> 00:50:50.125
what we experience works for nothing.

1026
00:50:51.375 --> 00:50:52.785
That there's an arbitrary element

1027
00:50:52.845 --> 00:50:55.065
to life in which things happen that have no purpose,

1028
00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:56.665
no meaning and no redemption.

1029
00:50:57.645 --> 00:50:59.665
We might gaze at our sorrows and sufferings

1030
00:50:59.665 --> 00:51:01.385
and think there's no goodness in this

1031
00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:04.185
and no way goodness could ever come from this 'em this.

1032
00:51:05.815 --> 00:51:08.705
Without Romans 8 28, we would not have confidence that

1033
00:51:09.245 --> 00:51:10.585
all things work for good.

1034
00:51:11.365 --> 00:51:12.385
We might believe that some

1035
00:51:12.385 --> 00:51:13.985
of the things we experience ultimately work

1036
00:51:13.985 --> 00:51:16.265
for good while others ultimately work for our harm.

1037
00:51:17.375 --> 00:51:18.875
Or we might believe that some things work

1038
00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:20.395
for good while other things are empty

1039
00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:23.515
and meaningless, black holes in God's providence.

1040
00:51:25.225 --> 00:51:27.835
Without Romans 8 28, we might not see the hand

1041
00:51:27.835 --> 00:51:30.275
of God working in our suffering For

1042
00:51:30.275 --> 00:51:32.315
where things work together for good,

1043
00:51:32.605 --> 00:51:34.395
there must be someone who's working them.

1044
00:51:35.855 --> 00:51:40.665
Work requires a worker, we might assume as do so many today,

1045
00:51:40.665 --> 00:51:43.225
that an impersonal force like the universe is

1046
00:51:43.425 --> 00:51:44.545
ultimately behind our circumstances.

1047
00:51:45.205 --> 00:51:46.985
We might even assume that there's no deity

1048
00:51:46.985 --> 00:51:47.985
and no intelligent being

1049
00:51:47.985 --> 00:51:50.345
who acts out his providence within this universe.

1050
00:51:50.965 --> 00:51:53.225
But just cold, impersonal fate.

1051
00:51:55.055 --> 00:51:57.105
Without Romans A 28, we might neglect

1052
00:51:57.125 --> 00:51:59.985
to meditate on the fact that our purpose in this world is

1053
00:51:59.985 --> 00:52:01.505
to serve God's purpose

1054
00:52:01.935 --> 00:52:04.185
that we've been called according to his purpose.

1055
00:52:05.525 --> 00:52:08.585
We might fail to ponder the truth that if we are called

1056
00:52:08.605 --> 00:52:10.225
to experience trials, it's

1057
00:52:10.225 --> 00:52:12.665
because God has purposes to accomplish through them

1058
00:52:12.965 --> 00:52:15.825
and that we can bring glory to him if we meet these trials

1059
00:52:15.885 --> 00:52:18.785
and pass through them with our faith, strong and intact act.

1060
00:52:20.695 --> 00:52:24.305
Without Romans 8 28, our suffering would be intolerable.

1061
00:52:24.605 --> 00:52:27.905
We might rightly conclude that our sorrows are meaningless.

1062
00:52:30.085 --> 00:52:32.905
But we do have Romans 8 28.

1063
00:52:33.925 --> 00:52:37.385
God has given it to us a gift of his grace.

1064
00:52:38.565 --> 00:52:40.945
Of course, we need to exercise good judgment when we bring

1065
00:52:40.945 --> 00:52:42.945
comfort to God's people as they suffer.

1066
00:52:43.165 --> 00:52:45.145
Of course, we need to choose the truth

1067
00:52:45.145 --> 00:52:46.425
that fits the circumstance.

1068
00:52:46.565 --> 00:52:49.225
Of course, we need to ensure we're not forcing a harsh

1069
00:52:49.245 --> 00:52:50.545
or inaccurate interpretation

1070
00:52:50.545 --> 00:52:52.305
of the passage as many have done.

1071
00:52:53.245 --> 00:52:56.065
But as for me, there are few verses more comforting

1072
00:52:56.065 --> 00:52:57.625
and more encouraging than this one.

1073
00:52:58.445 --> 00:53:01.265
God is working out his good, his goodwill,

1074
00:53:01.445 --> 00:53:04.945
not despite dark days, difficult trials and broken hearts,

1075
00:53:05.405 --> 00:53:09.505
but through them, Because Romans 8 28 exists.

1076
00:53:09.595 --> 00:53:12.865
Those who love God and are loved by him can have confidence

1077
00:53:12.865 --> 00:53:15.585
that he's working through all of life's circumstances.

1078
00:53:15.765 --> 00:53:18.985
To bring good out of bad light, out of darkness,

1079
00:53:19.405 --> 00:53:20.665
joy, out of sorrow.

1080
00:53:21.855 --> 00:53:24.985
It's not that God is especially agile, a kind

1081
00:53:25.045 --> 00:53:28.805
of cosmic PR man adept at manipulating circumstances,

1082
00:53:29.945 --> 00:53:33.285
but rather that he is the planner, the engineer,

1083
00:53:33.665 --> 00:53:36.485
the designer who has ordained the means just

1084
00:53:36.545 --> 00:53:37.765
as much as the end.

1085
00:53:38.745 --> 00:53:41.645
He ordains the calm and the storm, the darkness

1086
00:53:41.665 --> 00:53:43.925
and the dawn, the famine and the feast.

1087
00:53:45.175 --> 00:53:48.105
This being the case, no event is meaningless.

1088
00:53:48.685 --> 00:53:52.825
No situation purposeless, no condition, ultimately hopeless.

1089
00:53:54.145 --> 00:53:56.725
God is working out his goodwill, not despite dark days,

1090
00:53:56.725 --> 00:53:58.165
difficult trials and broken hearts,

1091
00:53:58.165 --> 00:54:02.405
but through them such circumstances are the raw material he

1092
00:54:02.515 --> 00:54:06.525
uses to form and shape his good plans, his perfect purposes.

1093
00:54:08.215 --> 00:54:10.525
God's specialty is not bringing good from good

1094
00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:11.965
but good from bad.

1095
00:54:12.745 --> 00:54:15.565
And Romans 8 28 gently tells me that if I trust him

1096
00:54:15.565 --> 00:54:18.485
through my tears, he will give me reason to laugh.

1097
00:54:19.225 --> 00:54:22.205
If I trust him through my pain, he'll teach me to praise.

1098
00:54:23.145 --> 00:54:24.445
If I trust him through my grief,

1099
00:54:24.975 --> 00:54:27.245
he'll afterwards show me all the good that came with it.

1100
00:54:27.245 --> 00:54:30.525
And through it, he'll show me the precious flowers in the

1101
00:54:30.525 --> 00:54:33.725
dry desert, the beautiful blooms against the sharp thorns,

1102
00:54:34.425 --> 00:54:36.765
the gentle petals beneath the vicious skies.

1103
00:54:37.785 --> 00:54:41.485
For behind every black cloud is a yellow sun bind.

1104
00:54:41.485 --> 00:54:44.375
Every dark night, a bright day bind,

1105
00:54:44.375 --> 00:54:48.335
every frowning providence, a smiling face, the smiling face

1106
00:54:48.335 --> 00:54:51.015
of the God who works all things for good, for those

1107
00:54:51.075 --> 00:54:54.575
who love him and are called according to his purpose.

1108
00:55:00.785 --> 00:55:05.525
It's hard. We will not always understand.

1109
00:55:07.965 --> 00:55:10.145
So I'm thankful we have Romans eight 20.

1110
00:55:15.805 --> 00:55:17.425
Let all our business is a quote I found.

1111
00:55:17.425 --> 00:55:19.225
Let all our business be to know God.

1112
00:55:20.205 --> 00:55:23.025
The more one knows him, the more one desires to know him.

1113
00:55:24.165 --> 00:55:27.145
And as knowledge is commonly the measure of love, the deeper

1114
00:55:27.245 --> 00:55:29.345
and more extensive our knowledge shall be,

1115
00:55:29.605 --> 00:55:31.145
the greater will be our love.

1116
00:55:31.925 --> 00:55:33.785
And if our love of God be great,

1117
00:55:34.245 --> 00:55:38.105
we shall love him equally in grief and enjoy.

1118
00:55:41.645 --> 00:55:43.065
So God, we pray tonight

1119
00:55:46.435 --> 00:55:47.335
in light of this,

1120
00:55:52.095 --> 00:55:56.545
there's a whole host of experiences of

1121
00:55:56.545 --> 00:55:59.105
that kind of grief questions.

1122
00:56:00.665 --> 00:56:04.315
Whether that's very directly, personally in lives

1123
00:56:04.425 --> 00:56:06.355
that are sitting in this room right now.

1124
00:56:09.925 --> 00:56:12.795
Along with that, we look at the world around US history

1125
00:56:12.935 --> 00:56:15.885
and we ask

1126
00:56:17.085 --> 00:56:20.575
legitimately, how is that good?

1127
00:56:26.105 --> 00:56:28.925
And so in our lack,

1128
00:56:30.745 --> 00:56:33.825
we come to you as the source,

1129
00:56:35.695 --> 00:56:39.515
as our wisdom, as the sovereign

1130
00:56:39.815 --> 00:56:41.035
God of the universe.

1131
00:56:47.935 --> 00:56:50.835
The one who Acts 17 says is near

1132
00:56:53.305 --> 00:56:55.045
to all who call upon you.

1133
00:57:00.835 --> 00:57:05.335
So God, we take heart in scriptures like Psalm 23,

1134
00:57:05.585 --> 00:57:10.215
where even though not if, even though

1135
00:57:11.635 --> 00:57:14.415
we walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

1136
00:57:16.075 --> 00:57:17.385
we'll fear no evil.

1137
00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:22.895
Not because we're strong 'cause we have it all together.

1138
00:57:23.455 --> 00:57:24.455
'cause we know the right answers.

1139
00:57:25.755 --> 00:57:30.515
We Will fear no evil because you are with me.

1140
00:57:33.225 --> 00:57:36.685
You are with us. Your rod and your staff, they comfort us.

1141
00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:41.405
You remind us firmly at times who you are,

1142
00:57:41.435 --> 00:57:42.125
that you're there,

1143
00:57:46.635 --> 00:57:48.445
that ultimately it's you carrying us God.

1144
00:57:54.085 --> 00:57:55.545
So God, I wanna lift up these

1145
00:57:56.445 --> 00:58:00.055
who are in situations.

1146
00:58:00.195 --> 00:58:03.215
And I know that's true in the size of this group,

1147
00:58:03.215 --> 00:58:07.315
that there's someone sitting in a really

1148
00:58:07.385 --> 00:58:08.515
dark place right now.

1149
00:58:14.275 --> 00:58:17.455
And even that question of how could you be good, God has,

1150
00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:24.135
has maybe touched a wound in their soul right now.

1151
00:58:31.455 --> 00:58:32.915
So Lord, I pray for them right now.

1152
00:58:33.055 --> 00:58:36.915
God give them the Holy Spirit,

1153
00:58:37.015 --> 00:58:38.435
be the comforter right now,

1154
00:58:46.095 --> 00:58:46.995
the very present.

1155
00:58:47.145 --> 00:58:49.515
Help in time of trouble. God, that you are

1156
00:58:56.855 --> 00:58:59.785
Lord as as big as, as immense

1157
00:59:00.205 --> 00:59:02.505
as we've seen you in your attributes tonight.

1158
00:59:02.755 --> 00:59:07.235
Again, may you remind us though how,

1159
00:59:09.065 --> 00:59:13.445
how near you are to your children,

1160
00:59:20.855 --> 00:59:25.125
that you love us with a perfect never stopping,

1161
00:59:25.375 --> 00:59:28.925
never giving up always and forever kind of love.

1162
00:59:35.045 --> 00:59:39.545
And You are working for the good of those who love you.

1163
00:59:41.065 --> 00:59:43.565
Or we, we acknowledge that that good may not come

1164
00:59:43.655 --> 00:59:47.385
until we see you face, face-to-face someday, till we

1165
00:59:48.695 --> 00:59:50.945
take off these flesh suits here and

1166
00:59:51.965 --> 00:59:53.505
and get new ones when you return.

1167
00:59:53.555 --> 00:59:53.905
Jesus,

1168
00:59:58.645 --> 00:59:59.115
thank you.

1169
01:00:00.615 --> 01:00:02.635
We know that good is coming

1170
01:00:04.505 --> 01:00:07.245
and one day there will be no more pain, no more suffering,

1171
01:00:07.265 --> 01:00:07.925
no more tears,

1172
01:00:12.235 --> 01:00:15.295
no more death, no more questions like this.

1173
01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:20.095
It will be as it should be.

1174
01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:28.845
So Lord, encourage your people tonight

1175
01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:36.935
that it is good for us to see you study.

1176
01:00:36.995 --> 01:00:40.995
You think on these things.

1177
01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.265
Search your word.

1178
01:00:44.005 --> 01:00:47.785
God, I pray you for a hunger for each of us to to dive in,

1179
01:00:47.785 --> 01:00:50.585
not just to sit and wonder, but to actually dive into your

1180
01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:54.465
special revelation to us that you've told us about yourself,

1181
01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:59.345
and we can know you and we'd hunger for that

1182
01:00:59.445 --> 01:01:02.865
and we would feed on your word.

1183
01:01:06.925 --> 01:01:09.585
But ultimately, God, when we acknowledge in the end that we

1184
01:01:10.575 --> 01:01:14.825
will not fully understand everything about the mystery,

1185
01:01:14.895 --> 01:01:15.865
that is God,

1186
01:01:20.365 --> 01:01:23.055
help us walk in faith humbly.

1187
01:01:35.315 --> 01:01:36.905
Thank you for grace. God,

1188
01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:43.985
thank you that you have met us in our sin,

1189
01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:50.185
Defeated it, overcame it

1190
01:01:54.185 --> 01:01:58.415
made us holy, righteous good.

1191
01:02:05.525 --> 01:02:09.185
Two Corinthians three says, as we with unveiled face,

1192
01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:12.545
behold your glory, you change us

1193
01:02:13.255 --> 01:02:16.425
into the same image from one degree of glory to the next.

1194
01:02:17.605 --> 01:02:20.245
So God, as we look at you, as we, we see you again

1195
01:02:20.995 --> 01:02:22.205
tonight in a new way.

1196
01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:26.045
Hopefully you have shown that to us in our hearts.

1197
01:02:26.105 --> 01:02:28.245
But as we see that, Lord, change us

1198
01:02:29.555 --> 01:02:30.925
into your image more Jesus.

1199
01:02:33.465 --> 01:02:35.125
One degree. One degree.

1200
01:02:37.825 --> 01:02:40.195
Keep orienting us towards that true north.

1201
01:02:45.605 --> 01:02:47.665
You're worthy. God, you're worthy of it all.

1202
01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:51.105
Thank you for meeting with us tonight,

1203
01:02:51.105 --> 01:02:55.145
giving us this opportunity and privilege to study

1204
01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:57.425
and discuss and examine you.

1205
01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:04.545
Send us in your power and grace as we go now for your glory

1206
01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:08.495
and the authority of Jesus we pray. Amen.

1207
01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:13.335
Amen. Thanks everybody. Love you.

1208
01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:14.695
We're sent.
