00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.020
Hurricane Mitch hit Nicaragua in 1998.

2
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.940
Almost 4,000 people were just wiped out and drowned in central

3
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.180
Nicaragua. And Mike Wall led a team down there,

4
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.020
and that's where he first met Dees And Dees lives in the foreign northern

5
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.380
part of Nicaragua, almost to the Honduran border in a town called.

6
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.540
And he had grand plans and a grand vision for church planting

7
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.220
and for a seminary.

8
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.980
Most of those early trips were medical trips. Typically,

9
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.060
the EZ or his network of pastors saw that there was a need or a,

10
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.860
a community that did not have a church. We would take a medical team in,

11
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.460
and at the end of the clinic,

12
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.940
the believers would come in, uh,

13
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.020
share the gospel with all those people that had been seen in the clinic that

14
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.370
day,

15
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.820
Through that proclamation of the gospel and people's response,

16
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.860
then planning a church, providing them with a pastor to lead that group.

17
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.540
And then as that group would grow and flourish and continue,

18
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660
if it was sustained, then we would go in and,

19
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.300
and provide a building for that group to meet in.

20
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.500
And then that would propel their ministry more and more.

21
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.420
And then typically we would take a construction crew down led by Caleb McKay,

22
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.100
build a four wall cinder block type of building.

23
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.740
Over the course of the years,

24
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.940
Henderson Hills has probably been responsible for at least 25 to 30

25
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460
of those church plants.

26
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.980
One of the next projects that Deez really needed in San Mateo was a

27
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.300
faith-based medical clinic. So we decided that, um,

28
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.620
we would try to come alongside and do in ministries of Jesus Nicaragua.

29
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.100
In 2012,

30
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.260
we sent Stephanie Egert and Jamie Nicks to Santio to

31
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.900
basically help finish the construction of ministries of Jesus.

32
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.940
In May of 2013, we actually had the ribbon cutting.

33
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.940
And M O j Nicaragua opened its doors for the first time to give

34
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.500
care body, soul, and spirit, much like we do right here in Edmond.

35
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.820
Uh, somewhere close to 2013, 2014,

36
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.860
as a church and as a missions department,

37
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.720
really thought it was important to start raising up business leaders or

38
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.520
businesses overseas.

39
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.880
We really wanted to go to reach Muslim believers,

40
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.680
whether that be in Europe or in North Africa.

41
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.760
And we felt like it was easiest to try and start doing a business in

42
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.840
Nicaragua first, develop the business plan and then branch out from there. Uh,

43
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.640
so around 2013, 2014, we chose mate gpa.

44
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.720
One of the neatest parts of presence,

45
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.640
or our platform in Monte GPA is what's called the A L C or the Academy

46
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.440
of Language and Culture. So it started with the Stinsons.

47
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.640
They moved to Alpa.

48
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.680
The Lord provided a building to rent and then a house close by that they could

49
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.440
live in. And they started the work of starting a language academy.

50
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.640
Tom and Brenda Shively were instrumental in curriculum development,

51
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.560
business planning from the very beginning.

52
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.520
And then the stensons were the boots on the ground.

53
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.480
We were able to have teachers go from Henderson Hills for as short as a week or

54
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.040
two, and as long as a year or two,

55
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.320
we got the opportunity to build a relationship on that platform of a language

56
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.280
school. And so that was started in 20 13, 20 14,

57
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.960
and has continued on to today. And,

58
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.840
and out of the a l C has birthed an a language institute in North Africa.

59
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.680
One of the other visionary things that Edes wanted to do was

60
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.760
start an official seminary in and around Sania. For years,

61
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.520
he and his, uh,

62
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.280
pastors had raised up young men to teach and preach

63
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.280
in so many of these small villages or communities and churches were built.

64
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.280
But he really wanted more of a formalized education.

65
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.880
Somewhere around 2017, uh, this was started in Someo.

66
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.880
The members of Henderson Hills have completely raised all monies for

67
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.720
that so that every student that goes through there on a two year, um,

68
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.480
educational track is fully funded. You know,

69
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.080
almost a hundred pastors had formal training that is now

70
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.120
recognized by the Nicaraguan Baptist Association.

71
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.120
So many times we think about partnering with a local church so that we can build

72
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.953
their ministry.

73
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.200
And one thing that we discovered being a part of Mi Glacia Batista in

74
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.240
Alpa was that they had so much ministry going on already that churches also

75
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.800
partnered with in those days, two other,

76
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.160
and now three other church plants in the area,

77
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.880
in other communities that are maybe 30 minutes in either direction to go

78
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.600
and share the gospel and plant churches and grow those churches.

79
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.320
And one way that we saw that happen was in a community called Keda Onda.

80
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.200
That community had a fellowship of believers that had been pretty small.

81
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.960
And throughout that year, we continued to evangelize in that community,

82
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.360
continued to share and to pray for that community. And they had,

83
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.440
they had had a little structure built. It was a roof and a slab.

84
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.680
And one of their, one of their goals, one of their visions was to,

85
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.320
to construct a building. And so partnering with Caleb McKay and,

86
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.520
and some of his guys were able to come together and, and we had a really,

87
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.080
really neat trip where we, where we built a building.

88
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.040
We have seen that bear fruit in that community in the years since.

89
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.280
You think it's not a building and the church isn't a building,

90
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.480
but having some place for them to meet and gather and home base, uh,

91
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.800
so to speak, has really propelled ministry even in that community.

92
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.480
We're open to what the Lord will do,

93
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.640
continue and continue to plant churches in and around Alpa in around Santio.

94
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.160
So we see that him continuing to, to grow this out and so that the,

95
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.040
the churches that we've had a part in planting by God's grace then

96
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.640
continue to have a calling to do the same down the road in that next community

97
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.800
down the road. So our prayer is that Santa Amelia,

98
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.880
as they grow and flourish,

99
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.120
will feel a calling to go to that next community down the road in San Ramon.

100
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.440
And that as the Lord continues to provide ministry leaders to come through our

101
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.920
seminary,

102
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.400
that they're equipped to go to those communities that they feel called and they

103
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.360
feel equipped because we know that it makes way more sense for a

104
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.520
Nicaraguan who speaks the language,

105
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.720
who knows the culture to be trained and then go into one of these communities

106
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.240
than it does for somebody like me.

107
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.000
Good morning church. Uh, my name's t r Lewis.

108
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.480
And it's a pleasure to be here this morning with you all celebrating Nicaragua

109
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.160
and all the work that God has done. Praise God. Praise God.

110
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.080
And it, it's a pleasure to introduce to you my friend, uh,

111
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.800
pastor Javier Moraga and Marcos Hernandez. So, uh,

112
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.440
Javier was the, the, is the pastor of Premier cia, Baptista,

113
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.200
which is in Alpa First Baptist Church, ALPA,

114
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.640
which is where my family and I worshiped. He was our pastor for a year.

115
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.440
And during that year, we didn't have the opportunity to have a translator.

116
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.200
So you guys have Marcos to translate, uh, for him this morning. We, we,

117
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.560
that was part of our learning of Spanish was, was under Pastor Moraga. And,

118
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.640
but over the years, God has knit our family together in a very special way.

119
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.280
It's created relationships where our daughter, Emma,

120
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.760
went and lived with his family,

121
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.040
with their family for six weeks and their daughter Azalea has come and,

122
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.160
and lived with our family for a time. And just seeing the,

123
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.560
the kingdom grow and, and then for, for God to,

124
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.720
uh, connect our hearts, uh, and, and,

125
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.000
and ministry for the kingdom has really blessed my life. So I'm,

126
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.360
I'm excited that we're all getting to hear from Pastor Moraga this morning,

127
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.320
and then we'll also hear more this afternoon.

128
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.520
So I'd love to pray for these brothers as we open God's word together.

129
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.960
Father God, you are so good to us.

130
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.350
You have blessed this church.

131
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.440
You've blessed Nicaragua and you've given us a relationship,

132
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.070
a relationship that's, and, and a unity that's based in you,

133
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.550
that's founded in you, that's given by your spirit. And so Father,

134
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.510
we pray that that would be a testimony to the world,

135
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.910
that this partnership, this, this amta, this relationship,

136
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.270
father, that, that you've,

137
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.110
you've given us together is a reflection of the relationship that we have with

138
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.990
you in love and in grace. So Father, this morning as we open your word together,

139
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.870
as Pastor Javier walks us through your word,

140
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.950
may our hearts be open to the ways that you might call and speak this morning.

141
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.870
It's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.

142
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.130
Thank

143
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:53.050
You brother Thomas and tr and thank you for all the congregation and for

144
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.370
participating in this celebration.

145
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.490
I would like to start by reading the scripture in the book of John chapter 20,

146
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.850
verse 19 through 21.

147
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.640
And it says, on the evening of that first day of the week,

148
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:23.040
when the disciples were together with the doors locked for

149
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.440
fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said,

150
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.120
peace be with you. After He, after he has said this,

151
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.640
he showed them his hands.

152
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.520
And inside the disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord

153
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.960
again, Jesus said, please be with you. As the Father has sent me.

154
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.320
I am sending you,

155
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.603
I mean

156
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.410
This part where God says,

157
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.770
just as God has sent me the same way I send you,

158
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.370
this is one part I really like.

159
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.890
Before we continue,

160
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.370
I would like to start with a word of congratulations to all of you,

161
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.903
Pastor.

162
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.130
I would like to congratulate the church, Henderson Hills, our pastor,

163
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.050
the elders, and all the leadership

164
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.023
Pastor.

165
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.370
'cause it's been a wonderful and a big blessing just to be through all these

166
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.810
25 years planting churches and, uh, training leaders

167
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.263
Is,

168
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.690
And it is more than wonderful everything that has happened in this last 25

169
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.523
years.

170
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.210
And that reminds me that word where he says, because for him and by him,

171
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.490
all things are done.

172
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.450
Congratulations

173
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.283
Church.

174
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.050
And the second thing is also I would like to thank

175
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.230
Bueno

176
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.890
Our God is wonderfully, wonderfully good.

177
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.480
And the same words that our brother ti said.

178
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.800
My name, my name is J We are, uh,

179
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.080
pastoring the First Baptist Church in Mat.

180
00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:58.900
And

181
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.040
I'm happily marry with my wife, which she's with us this morning,

182
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.000
and our daughter Ella, which she was singing this, uh, a little bit ago.

183
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.080
And we have two other sons, which are serving back then in Nicaragua, in Mat.

184
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.800
And many of you have already been there and know the church in Mat.

185
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.680
And I wish every one, every single one of you would be with us in Mat

186
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.680
Cafe. We

187
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.360
Would like, I would like to enjoy a delicious cup of coffee with a OSA

188
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.740
Pastor Mike Wall.

189
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.860
We wanna thank also Brother Mike Wall for his family and his ministry.

190
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.453
S

191
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.020
For the courage that our brother ti had to travel to Nicaragua and live with us

192
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.873
for one year.

193
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.060
And for all the rest of you that have been there and have traveled,

194
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.500
thank you so much for, um, being with us and helping us develop this,

195
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:31.723
this work.

196
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.540
The most wonderful thing is to have that connection with God.

197
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.720
And by the glory of God, we have, um,

198
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.280
at least 30 years serving in Mat.

199
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.440
Just like the Apostle Paul said,

200
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.680
I praise God for he has given me this ministry.

201
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.350
And I would like to go back to this scripture once again to speak about what it

202
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.590
says because the purpose of this morning is not to talk about us,

203
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.030
but to talk about him.

204
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.220
There's many texts in the Bible that speak to us about the plans that God has.

205
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.940
And one of the things is that because we are able to get together and sing these

206
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.380
uh, songs and worship God is just because God is good.

207
00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.460
You have

208
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.620
Been blessed by the Lord.

209
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:02.980
You

210
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.020
Have a wonderful praise and worship team,

211
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.340
and you have a wonderful weather. It is a little bit cold for us,

212
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.340
but wonderful weather.

213
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:27.390
And Jeremiah say, well, the plans that I have for you are for good,

214
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.483
not for evil.

215
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.710
And the greatest plan that God has had for humanity is to send his only son

216
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.110
Jesus Christ, for the salvation of all of us

217
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:49.770
And

218
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.070
All of us. We have heard of the redemption plan of God, how he has saved us

219
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.360
Grand Commission.

220
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.560
And there's many texts in the Bible that speak to us about that great commission

221
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:07.690
Because

222
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.120
We've been blessed because God is already with us,

223
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.520
The name of Amelia, we have family, we have work,

224
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.400
We have many things.

225
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.480
But

226
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.760
The most wonderful thing we have is the presence of God in our hearts.

227
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.960
The the greatness and the strength of a family is not what they have.

228
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:34.480
It

229
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.320
Is not the scientific knowledge that we could have.

230
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:39.960
It

231
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.280
Is not anything to do with the material possessions that we could have.

232
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.560
It is the presence of God in our hearts.

233
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.440
And Jesus Christ has commissioned the church

234
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.360
so that we can share with other people.

235
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.680
An example, Matthew chapter 28, Marco

236
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.710
Mark,

237
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.960
Chapter 16,

238
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.240
chapter 24, John

239
00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.540
21, 1

240
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680
Corinthians chapter nine.

241
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.240
And

242
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.400
We can continue reading scripture after scripture of the things that we know God

243
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.233
wants us to do.

244
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.400
And that is to share Christ with all the people.

245
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.613
Gloria,

246
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.000
We praise God for all the things, the material things that we received.

247
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.060
But

248
00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.320
All these things, all those things will disappear.

249
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:54.920
But

250
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.560
The presence of God is forever in our hearts

251
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.453
Is

252
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.960
The life that God gives is life eternal.

253
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.000
The context of this text

254
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.240
is the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

255
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.360
The image that disciples had,

256
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.080
it's an image of sadness

257
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.800
that Jesus that was doing miracles,

258
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:31.240
That

259
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.800
Jesus that was healing the sick,

260
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.200
that Jesus that come down this, the, the storm

261
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.973
has died.

262
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.280
This is the first day of the week,

263
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.800
and that's what this text says.

264
00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.240
And in that same day, Jesus appeared to the disciples

265
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.150
that Jesus that was dead. Now he's alive.

266
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.510
And the first thing that we can see on this verses is the joy of the disciples.

267
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:20.790
The

268
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.670
Disciples were happy.

269
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.110
And that's what happens when you are in the presence of God.

270
00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.790
In I, in

271
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.190
The presence of God. There's plenty, plenty of joy

272
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.350
when we come to the lore. Our lives are transformed.

273
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.430
There's a story on the chapter of Mark chapter five that says that a man was

274
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.310
very, very sick.

275
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.950
A man that lived in the cemetery.

276
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.070
And when Jesus got to that place where this man was,

277
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.710
Jesus Christ had an encounter with this man and he transformed and changed his

278
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.573
life.

279
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.270
And when this man has been transformed by the power of God,

280
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.833
Jesus,

281
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.270
These men wanted to stay with Jesus.

282
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:38.110
But

283
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.190
Jesus told these words,

284
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.203
AMI, go to

285
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.790
Your people, to your family and tell them

286
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.310
and tell them how great things God has done with you.

287
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.030
He has mercy on you.

288
00:21:58.930 --> 00:21:59.150
And

289
00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.150
That's what God has done with every one of us.

290
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.230
And that encounter where Jesus Christ has resurrected,

291
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.190
the disciples are so joyful.

292
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.430
Pass our so.

293
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.070
And Jesus said this word, peace be with you.

294
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.190
He blessed be the Lord because he is our peace.

295
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:32.020
He

296
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.910
Also said, my P the p my peace, I gave you my my peace.

297
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.923
You will have.

298
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.910
And that is because when we're under the lore, we have peace.

299
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.630
And that's a great blessing that every Christian in every part of the world,

300
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.310
we can trust in the peace of God.

301
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.070
There's

302
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:09.710
A verse in the book of visa, Isaiah chapter 26, verses three and four,

303
00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.870
that is very important for you and for me

304
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.693
To gu

305
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.950
You will keep imperfect peace to him that perseveres in you

306
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.840
because he has trust in you.

307
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.040
And we need to trust God because in him,

308
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.680
we have the strength of of God in our lives.

309
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.000
And we also see in this verse how the,

310
00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:00.600
the work of God in the person of Jesus Christ also does. He says he,

311
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.080
my father has sent me

312
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:06.873
Romantic.

313
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.400
And that's a declaration that is not a really romantic declaration.

314
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.800
It's a powerful declaration,

315
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.640
It's

316
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.473
A lifestyle.

317
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.000
Jesus Christ came to this world with a very specific purpose.

318
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.800
And that was to redeem this world.

319
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:38.120
There's

320
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.760
A verse that we can read and we'll ask you to open your bibles in the book of

321
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.593
Colossians.

322
00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.400
And we're gonna read Colossians chapter one verses 16,

323
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.940
chapter one, verse 16.

324
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.233
And the verse says,

325
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:09.270
for by him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth,

326
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.910
visible and invisible.

327
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.910
Whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities,

328
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.750
all things were created by him and for him.

329
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.660
And this is a glorious declaration.

330
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.620
And this glorious declaration is manifested on that encounter between Jesus

331
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.860
Christ and his disciples.

332
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.170
And the thought that we have,

333
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.290
we need to keep in our minds is that as he has sent me, so I send you

334
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.580
now, the Lord is sending us each one of us.

335
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.860
And I think there's a few elements that we need to consider that God gives us as

336
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.980
a family, as a church.

337
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:25.890
And the first thing is that when we go, we go based on the word of God.

338
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.103
Gloria,

339
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.690
Glory to God for this wonderful book,

340
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:33.890
The

341
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:34.730
Word of God for us

342
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.680
and all the Christians that understand that God is calling us to a mission.

343
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.440
We have to base that on the word of God.

344
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.040
One Timothy chapter three, lemme open that for you.

345
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.080
One Timothy chapter three verses

346
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.520
At this time there's a man where God has, uh, a sign,

347
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.320
a wonderful man, uh, this, this advice and has tell him this advice.

348
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.480
Chapter one,

349
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.890
although I hope to come to you soon,

350
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:41.010
I am writing to you this instructions so that if I I'm delay,

351
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.850
you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household.

352
00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.080
And

353
00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.840
This is one more reason why we need to base our life in the word of God.

354
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.800
God senses us in spite of our age.

355
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.820
I can see over here we have all ages, John, people, adults,

356
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.260
elder people,

357
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.820
and God has no problem to involve every one of you in his plan

358
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.793
of mission.

359
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.820
God calls older people like Moses and uh,

360
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.523
Abra

361
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.700
and God calls young people like Jeremiah

362
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.200
And

363
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.380
God call all very different for different from different backgrounds with

364
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.540
different life stories.

365
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:04.810
But

366
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.420
Also God call us to prepare ourselves for that mission.

367
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.770
What

368
00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:16.450
Is that preparation that we must have? We need to prepare yourself

369
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.450
With prayer. With prayer

370
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.250
On the reading of the scripture,

371
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.730
my beloved brothers,

372
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.290
the mission that the church has is to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.

373
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.810
And

374
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.930
We need to be fundamentally based on this scripture.

375
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.810
It doesn't matter what our age is

376
00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.200
and to prepare ourselves in this wonderful book.

377
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.500
Many times we dedicate time in many other things.

378
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.220
We can spend hours and hours doing other tasks,

379
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.440
But

380
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.740
God is waiting for us that we may participate on this mission.

381
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.660
I'm going to this live and this mission consecrating our lives. For this is

382
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.890
Jesus Christ. When he was praying for the church and his disciples, he said,

383
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.650
sanctify them. Sanctify them in your word.

384
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.170
My beloved brother, we have been blessed, we have been sanctified.

385
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.730
We have been called to live a life for him

386
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.470
And

387
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.170
God is calling us so that we can go and do this work in love.

388
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:09.050
And Paul says also that even though we are sin, as cry, die for us

389
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:11.090
And

390
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.090
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

391
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.380
And let me kind of tell you a little bit of, um, um,

392
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.780
tell you what Nicaragua really is.

393
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.283
Nicaragua

394
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.500
A few words. We are the, uh, Baptist Convention in Nicaragua,

395
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.820
328 churches

396
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.700
and they're organized in 12 regions.

397
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.620
And we are the north central region. That's where we are located.

398
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.220
And there's three cities within that region.

399
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.780
The area of mat,

400
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:09.860
We

401
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.540
Have 13 smaller cities

402
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.340
and that part of has 600,000, uh,

403
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.700
around 600,000. Uh, Hess,

404
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.420
the city has more than 200,000

405
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.040
and we only have three churches in the city of Mat.

406
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.440
And there's another, uh, city where there's other two churches.

407
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.530
However, there's many other places within that area that there's no church.

408
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.450
And when we read the scriptures and we have that image,

409
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.370
when Jesus Christ appeared to his disciples

410
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.040
without wonderful words, it says, please be with you.

411
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.520
As the Father has sent me. Jesus said,

412
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.880
I am sending you

413
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.400
le beloved brothers, we need you to come to Nicaragua.

414
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.360
We

415
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.800
Thank God for all these 25 years that had passed.

416
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:49.880
And

417
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.800
Now what we're gonna do, everybody just gonna go home

418
00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.800
or doing our own business.

419
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.480
Oh, we're gonna say, just like the prophet said,

420
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.140
I am here, send me,

421
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.050
oh, when Paul, when he was first saw, when he was persecuting the church,

422
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:24.370
And

423
00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.490
He has an personal encounter with Jesus,

424
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.770
And

425
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.730
I love what the puzzle Paul said,

426
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.170
Lord, what do you want me to do?

427
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.640
He didn't say, Lord,

428
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.280
what do you want the pastor or the elders or the leadership to do? He said,

429
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.440
Lord, what do you want me to do?

430
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.320
And I just would like to bring everything that I have said in this few,

431
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.613
in this few minutes

432
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.280
and to think that this celebration of 25 years that we have had of ministry,

433
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.120
that the next 25 years,

434
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.200
the next 25 years have to have four columns,

435
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.170
Four

436
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.880
Bases, where all these things is gonna be, uh, as a foundation.

437
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.880
The first one is to exalt and glorify the name of Jesus,

438
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:42.783
Jude

439
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.600
1 25, Jude 1 25

440
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.313
Salvador

441
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.360
To the only one and wise, our Lord Jesus,

442
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:54.923
Glory

443
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.600
Be the glory and majesty.

444
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.920
He's empire and powerful now and forever.

445
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:13.680
The Apostle Paul in one Timothy one 17 says, uh,

446
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.400
for to the king of kings,

447
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.553
I

448
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.240
Immortal and invisible to the only one.

449
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.400
And wise Gods

450
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.960
be honor and glory for the forever and ever.

451
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.120
The second column is being grateful.

452
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:45.160
You have to recognize that we are in the best company. Of all the times,

453
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.280
many things are going to happen

454
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:49.743
Like,

455
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.960
But the church of Jesus Christ is gonna stand forever.

456
00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.200
That's

457
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.033
What he said.

458
00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.760
The gates of hell will not prevail against the church of God.

459
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:08.560
And

460
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.840
The third column is lives that are consecrated to God.

461
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.120
The Apostle Paul said, with Christ, I am crucified.

462
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.840
It is not me that I live

463
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:22.940
Me,

464
00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.160
But Christ lives in me.

465
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.280
And where I live in this flesh,

466
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.160
I live in the faith of God who love me.

467
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.540
And the fourth column,

468
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:43.300
Make

469
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.380
Yourself available to the purposes of God.

470
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.200
We need you.

471
00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.400
We have that image of saying everything for the glory of God,

472
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.880
thankful to God because he gives the privilege to serve him

473
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.640
and consecrating our lies for the glory of God.

474
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.000
And with that attitude to go and do the work of God.

475
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:28.370
Brothers

476
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.780
And sisters,

477
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:33.770
we're gonna celebrate another 25 years and we're gonna base this on the presence

478
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:38.680
of God. Please be with you. Jesus said,

479
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.960
as the Father has sent me, I

480
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:43.853
See

481
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.120
That's the way I send you. Now what are you going to do?

482
00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.573
Are you gonna go?

483
00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:53.640
Are

484
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.560
You gonna stay? And some of you may not be able to go

485
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.123
Mission.

486
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.540
And we could say, we could pray for missions,

487
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.180
Missionaries, and

488
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.020
You may not be able to go, but you can pray for the missionaries.

489
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.620
We need pastors in mat.

490
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.460
Praise God for all the work that is being done in.

491
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.740
We need many pastors in many areas of, uh, of that part of Nicaragua,

492
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.660
and many of you cannot go, but you can give for the missions

493
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.660
and all that can go, all those courageous,

494
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.473
all Christians,

495
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.620
let's go and put the name of God above everything because there's no,

496
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.260
there's no greater name than the name of Jesus Christ.

497
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:08.700
Let's

498
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.100
Stand up and give thanks to God.
