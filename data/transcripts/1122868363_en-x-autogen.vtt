1
00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:17.325
Good morning church.

2
00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:19.365
What a great day it is to be able

3
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.005
to worship together like this.

4
00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:23.205
Uh, we're so thankful for it.

5
00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:24.965
Here's how I wanna start today,

6
00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:26.485
a little differently than normal.

7
00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:29.805
I want you to put yourself in this parable

8
00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:31.445
that I came across this week

9
00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:35.045
and I want you to just kind of stop everything,

10
00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:37.645
close your eyes and just try to imagine yourself

11
00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:41.365
as the one speaking in this parable.

12
00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:43.965
So close your eyes, kind of focus in

13
00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.325
and just imagine you are the one saying what I'm saying.

14
00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.545
The notification pops up on my cracked phone screen at

15
00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:55.625
2:47 PM on a Tuesday.

16
00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:59.745
Your student loans have been paid off.

17
00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.625
I'm sitting in my studio apartment in the

18
00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:04.665
worst part of town.

19
00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:08.225
The place I ended up after dad's business collapsed

20
00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:10.345
and took our family's reputation with it.

21
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.995
Three years of scandal, bankruptcy lawsuits.

22
00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:18.075
Three years of watching friends cross the

23
00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:19.155
street to avoid me.

24
00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:21.665
Three years of living off ramen

25
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.505
and the shame of a name that used to mean something.

26
00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:28.865
My legs haven't worked right since the car accident.

27
00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:32.105
During the worst of it when I was driving dad's Mercedes,

28
00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.185
that was repoed back to the dealership

29
00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:35.945
and I couldn't see through my tears,

30
00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:41.245
the surgeries we couldn't afford, the physical therapy

31
00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:42.485
that insurance wouldn't cover.

32
00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:46.645
Just another thing. Broken in a life full of broken things.

33
00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:50.535
I refreshed the app certain it's a

34
00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:51.615
mistake, but, but there it is.

35
00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:54.935
$127,000 in debt. Gone.

36
00:01:56.355 --> 00:02:00.015
Not just forgiven, absorbed, paid in full

37
00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:01.655
by someone I've never met.

38
00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.775
The letter arrives the next day on letterhead I recognized

39
00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:10.135
but never expected to see, addressed to me Johnson

40
00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:14.655
and Associates, the tech company my dad tried to sue

41
00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:18.055
during his downward spiral, the CEO,

42
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.975
whose reputation he tried to destroy in the press.

43
00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:26.235
Dear Marcus, your father and I were roommates in college.

44
00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:30.675
Best friends. Actually, I never forgot his kindness

45
00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.235
to me when I had nothing.

46
00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.565
I know he lost his way. And I know you've paid the price.

47
00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:42.475
I'd like to offer you a position on our team, full benefits,

48
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:44.715
stock options, and a salary

49
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.035
that will let you live with dignity.

50
00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:48.655
Not because you've earned it, but

51
00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:50.495
because that's what friends do for each other,

52
00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:54.695
even across years and mistakes and broken trust.

53
00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:58.295
Your father's love for me, when we were young was real.

54
00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.035
This is my way of honoring that.

55
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.425
The job starts Monday if you want it.

56
00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:08.195
I stare at the letter until the words blur.

57
00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:11.115
This isn't charity, this isn't pity.

58
00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:14.195
This is something else entirely love

59
00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.915
that reaches across the wreckage of failure

60
00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:20.555
and says, you belong at my table.

61
00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:23.935
Love that remembers friendship.

62
00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:25.895
When friendship seemed impossible.

63
00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:32.145
It's the second chance I never saw coming. It's grace.

64
00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:38.775
Okay, church, how would you feel in that moment?

65
00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:44.185
Overwhelmed, humbled,

66
00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:49.515
stunned, right?

67
00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:53.675
Your life had been over. You thought you'd been forgotten.

68
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.475
You thought nothing but pain was gonna be

69
00:03:56.475 --> 00:03:57.635
present in your life.

70
00:03:57.655 --> 00:04:00.675
And now all of a sudden life,

71
00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:05.815
it's a powerful parable, isn't it?

72
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.995
But I want us to also think a layer deeper

73
00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.515
like Jesus often did with his parables.

74
00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:16.235
Let's take it below the surface.

75
00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:21.575
Isn't that your story?

76
00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:26.275
If you're in Christ I, isn't

77
00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:28.515
that the story of every believer spiritually

78
00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:35.795
cast away, crippled by sin, nothing

79
00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:39.875
to offer yet God gives us his covenant love,

80
00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:43.115
his faithful mercy, his loving kindness.

81
00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.255
It's the Hebrew word I'm gonna say a number of times today.

82
00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:51.175
He said It's all over the Old Testament,

83
00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:53.775
but this is the point it makes in Deuteronomy

84
00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:54.815
seven verse nine.

85
00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:58.055
It says, know therefore that the Lord your God is God.

86
00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:02.335
The faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love.

87
00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:05.295
That's that word hesed with those who love him

88
00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:07.375
and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.

89
00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.975
This is our God, the faithful one

90
00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:17.025
who loves with kindness is loyal.

91
00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:19.555
That's what we're gonna study today.

92
00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:23.955
First, how each of us desperately need that kindness,

93
00:05:26.605 --> 00:05:28.505
But then also how that flips around.

94
00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:32.505
And God shows his kindness through us to others

95
00:05:32.605 --> 00:05:33.745
who need it as well.

96
00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.595
And so go ahead and take your copy of God's Word

97
00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:40.035
and turn with me to Second Samuel chapter eight

98
00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:42.275
as we continue our journey through this book.

99
00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:45.975
We're Gonna be in Second Samuel chapters eight

100
00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:47.495
through 10 today.

101
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:54.465
And here's where we're headed. We're gonna again see the

102
00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:57.685
kindness of God, but specifically we're gonna see in that

103
00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:01.205
how grace pursues the undeserving and

104
00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:03.765
and how some people don't always respond well to that.

105
00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:10.045
But I want you to remember also where we're at in the story.

106
00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:14.365
This narrative has taken us through David's ascension

107
00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:15.445
to the kingship.

108
00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:18.285
And so you'll see the chart again on the screen.

109
00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:22.445
This is the high point of David's rule in Israel.

110
00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:26.005
This is where we are now, where God is blessing David

111
00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:30.045
with land, with victories, even promised this eternal legacy

112
00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:32.365
that was gonna come through the Son of David,

113
00:06:32.535 --> 00:06:34.805
which we now know to be Jesus eternally.

114
00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:36.405
But this is where we're at.

115
00:06:36.405 --> 00:06:40.285
We're at the highest peak of it, yet as good

116
00:06:40.285 --> 00:06:41.325
as it was at this point.

117
00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:47.415
Next week, chapter 11 begins the downfall,

118
00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.025
David and of Israel.

119
00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:54.275
So we're not there yet.

120
00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:57.315
Let's enjoy while we last here in this section

121
00:06:57.415 --> 00:06:58.595
of the passage.

122
00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:02.315
But, but just know that that's coming starting next week.

123
00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:08.675
So here in chapter eight we see that God has given David all

124
00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:11.115
of these things and we see David's military conquests

125
00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:12.435
and how God is expanding the kingdom,

126
00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:14.915
making them a dominant regional power.

127
00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:18.475
But I wanna just look at two verses here, verse six

128
00:07:18.535 --> 00:07:21.555
and verse 14 here in chapter eight.

129
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.785
And this will show us something I want you to see verse six,

130
00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:25.945
the very end of verse six.

131
00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:30.895
It says, and the Lord gave victory

132
00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:32.415
to David wherever he went.

133
00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:37.695
Now down in verse 14, again, the very end of that verse.

134
00:07:39.765 --> 00:07:43.905
And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.

135
00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:46.755
I think it's pretty clear what

136
00:07:46.755 --> 00:07:47.875
I'm trying to say with that, right?

137
00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:51.475
It wasn't military genius, it wasn't superior strategy.

138
00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:53.795
Even though David was the ultimate warrior, right?

139
00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:58.395
He, he was seeing God's hesed kindness in

140
00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.475
action in his life.

141
00:08:00.535 --> 00:08:02.555
God was bringing victory. God was bringing victory.

142
00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:05.035
David's kingdom was not being established

143
00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:08.675
because of his worthiness, but because of God's promise.

144
00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:12.465
Remember David was the, the eighth son.

145
00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:15.705
He was out in the field taking care of sheep and,

146
00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:18.065
and God called him to this role.

147
00:08:21.615 --> 00:08:23.635
But listen, that's what God's kindness does.

148
00:08:25.295 --> 00:08:27.755
It establishes unshakeable kingdoms.

149
00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.955
That's what we're needing to see from this point here, is

150
00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:35.635
that God's kindness establishes unshakeable kingdoms.

151
00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.285
That's why I emphasize those two verses.

152
00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:43.125
Because it was the Lord who was the one building the nation.

153
00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:46.435
It was the Lord who was bringing the victories.

154
00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:49.275
They were relying on God to overcome these enemies

155
00:08:49.275 --> 00:08:51.515
that they previously thought were insurmountable,

156
00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:53.755
impossible enemies to defeat.

157
00:08:53.815 --> 00:08:55.405
And God was bringing, bringing victory.

158
00:08:55.715 --> 00:08:57.765
They looked back to Abraham's promise

159
00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.445
hundreds of years earlier.

160
00:08:59.825 --> 00:09:01.765
God said to Abraham, you're gonna have this land.

161
00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:03.045
You're gonna have these, these

162
00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:04.605
families that will be blessed through you.

163
00:09:04.665 --> 00:09:06.405
And they're looking back and God's bringing it.

164
00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:08.645
God's doing it through his people.

165
00:09:10.075 --> 00:09:12.215
God was the one building the kingdom.

166
00:09:13.195 --> 00:09:16.015
But I want you

167
00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:18.415
to think about something even more important than

168
00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:20.255
what they were experiencing back then.

169
00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:22.845
Think about the kingdom of heaven.

170
00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:30.095
It's similar to how David's kingdom was established, not

171
00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:32.295
by his merit, but by God's promise.

172
00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:34.695
The kingdom of heaven is established not

173
00:09:34.715 --> 00:09:35.935
by our righteousness,

174
00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:40.905
but by Christ's righteousness for us, that's

175
00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:42.705
what Romans five 17 says.

176
00:09:42.705 --> 00:09:44.785
Listen to this for if

177
00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:46.665
because of one man's trespass

178
00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:48.745
that's talking about Adam all the way back in the garden

179
00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:52.625
for if because of one man's trespass, death reigned through

180
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:57.405
that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance

181
00:09:57.505 --> 00:10:00.805
of grace and the free gift of righteousness

182
00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:05.445
reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.

183
00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:10.485
It's his righteousness. It's his reign that we stand in.

184
00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:12.925
That's how we can reign with him, is

185
00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:16.705
because he reigns to begin with and we receive His grace.

186
00:10:17.275 --> 00:10:18.465
We're a part of it as well.

187
00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:20.105
You're a part of that kingdom of God.

188
00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:21.585
Not because you earned it, but

189
00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:24.865
because you trust in his work for you.

190
00:10:26.665 --> 00:10:29.685
That's the unshakable part. Your work is pretty shaky.

191
00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:32.125
Your foundation, if you're building on yours, is a,

192
00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:34.445
a shifting sand of a foundation.

193
00:10:35.975 --> 00:10:38.435
The unshakeable foundation is the perfection

194
00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:40.315
of Jesus Christ in your place.

195
00:10:42.165 --> 00:10:45.105
God is the one who builds unshakeable kingdoms.

196
00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:48.325
And here's why I remind you of that.

197
00:10:49.785 --> 00:10:52.985
'cause I know my tendency, imagine it's your tendency

198
00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:56.225
as well to default back

199
00:10:56.345 --> 00:10:58.905
to basing my salvation on my works.

200
00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:02.545
Now, you wouldn't say that out loud, right?

201
00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:03.905
'cause that's not the Sunday school answer.

202
00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:05.505
You shouldn't say that out loud like

203
00:11:05.805 --> 00:11:06.825
I'm trying to base myself.

204
00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:09.025
No, you wouldn't. You would say nothing about that.

205
00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:10.185
You would say the right answer, but,

206
00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:13.305
but what happens is that you feel like under the surface

207
00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:15.785
you're trying to earn your way in

208
00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:17.825
and you're gonna be good enough.

209
00:11:17.825 --> 00:11:19.305
You're better than the jerk down the street.

210
00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:22.025
And so you know God's gotta let you in.

211
00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:27.395
It's your works. Or maybe that's not for you.

212
00:11:28.635 --> 00:11:30.465
Maybe the flip side is true for you.

213
00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:35.115
Where you base your assurance on your performance.

214
00:11:37.335 --> 00:11:38.605
How'd you do this week? You know,

215
00:11:38.605 --> 00:11:40.205
like you, you, you really killed it.

216
00:11:40.205 --> 00:11:42.645
You're doing great. You're, you're feeling good that God,

217
00:11:42.825 --> 00:11:44.445
you're assured in your salvation

218
00:11:44.645 --> 00:11:46.365
'cause you did great this week morally.

219
00:11:46.585 --> 00:11:48.285
But those weeks that you train wreck,

220
00:11:50.295 --> 00:11:51.555
you're a little terrified

221
00:11:51.555 --> 00:11:52.995
that somehow God's gonna exclude

222
00:11:53.285 --> 00:11:54.325
you from the kingdom, right?

223
00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:57.205
See, that's basing it all on your works.

224
00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:01.915
It's all wrong. It's the Lord

225
00:12:02.335 --> 00:12:03.995
who gave victory to David.

226
00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:07.195
It's the Lord whose victory over sin is

227
00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:09.355
what guarantees the foundation for your eternity.

228
00:12:10.335 --> 00:12:14.075
Not you, not how well or badly you do.

229
00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:17.875
It's not about you at all. It's about his work for you.

230
00:12:19.495 --> 00:12:21.075
That's the unshakeable part of this.

231
00:12:22.455 --> 00:12:24.275
And listen, that should lead us to rejoice.

232
00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:27.115
That our citizenship in heaven is not

233
00:12:27.115 --> 00:12:28.315
based on our performance.

234
00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:31.595
How well we did or how well we didn't do.

235
00:12:31.715 --> 00:12:32.875
Like it's, it's not based.

236
00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:34.875
It's based on Jesus Christ

237
00:12:35.575 --> 00:12:38.105
for you simply.

238
00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:43.335
And that should lead us to joy in an unshakeable kingdom.

239
00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.665
It's his kindness. Well, here's

240
00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:52.475
what happens in chapter nine, we see a new way.

241
00:12:52.885 --> 00:12:54.475
God's kindness shows up.

242
00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:57.675
I'm gonna read the entire chapter here, chapter nine,

243
00:12:58.455 --> 00:13:00.195
and then we're gonna dig deeper into this one.

244
00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:03.235
One of my favorite passages in all of scripture right here,

245
00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:07.115
watch what chapter nine says.

246
00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:11.475
David said, is there still anyone left to the house of Saul

247
00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:13.995
that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

248
00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:16.655
Now, there was a servant of the house

249
00:13:16.655 --> 00:13:18.855
of Saul whose name was Zeba, and they called him to David.

250
00:13:18.955 --> 00:13:20.695
And the king said to him, are you a zeba?

251
00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:21.975
And he said, I am your servant.

252
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:24.615
And the king said, is there not still someone of the house

253
00:13:24.615 --> 00:13:26.735
of Saul that I may show the kindness of God to him?

254
00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:30.305
And Zeba said to the king, there's still a son of Jonathan.

255
00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:31.705
He's crippled in his feet.

256
00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:34.345
The king said to him, where is he?

257
00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.585
Zeba said to the king, he's in the house of Macke, the son

258
00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:39.425
of Emil at lo debar.

259
00:13:40.845 --> 00:13:42.055
Then King and David sent

260
00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.855
and brought him from the house of Macke, the son

261
00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:44.895
of Emil at Lo debar.

262
00:13:45.315 --> 00:13:49.295
And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came

263
00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:52.015
to David and fell on his face and paid homage.

264
00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:53.855
And David said, Mephibosheth.

265
00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:56.015
And he answered, behold, I am your servant.

266
00:13:56.315 --> 00:13:58.855
And David said to him, do not fear

267
00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:01.575
for I will show you kindness.

268
00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:04.135
That's that. He said, word.

269
00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:06.415
I will show you kindness for the sake

270
00:14:06.415 --> 00:14:07.775
of your father, Jonathan.

271
00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:11.845
And I will restore to you all the land of Saul, your father,

272
00:14:12.065 --> 00:14:14.485
and you shall eat at my table always.

273
00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:18.315
And he paid homage. And he said, what is your servant

274
00:14:18.465 --> 00:14:21.755
that you should show regard for a dead dog such as I?

275
00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:25.685
And then the king called Zeba, Saul's servant said to him,

276
00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:26.805
all that belong to Saul

277
00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:29.525
and to all his house, I've given to your master's grandson,

278
00:14:29.945 --> 00:14:31.045
and you and your sons,

279
00:14:31.045 --> 00:14:32.805
and your servants shall till the land for him

280
00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:34.005
and shall bring in the produce

281
00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:36.125
that your master's grandson may have bred to eat.

282
00:14:36.705 --> 00:14:39.365
But Mephibosheth, your master's grandson shall always

283
00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:40.445
eat at my table.

284
00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:43.825
Now, Zeba had 15 sons, 20 servants.

285
00:14:43.825 --> 00:14:45.905
And Zeba said to the king, according to all of my Lord,

286
00:14:45.905 --> 00:14:47.265
the king commands his servants.

287
00:14:47.365 --> 00:14:48.545
So will your servant do.

288
00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:51.485
So Mephibosheth ate at David's table like

289
00:14:51.505 --> 00:14:52.645
one of the king's sons.

290
00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:56.045
And Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micah,

291
00:14:56.545 --> 00:14:58.245
and all who lived in Zebra's house became

292
00:14:58.245 --> 00:14:59.445
Mephibosheth's servants.

293
00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.765
So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem

294
00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.525
and he ate always at the king's table.

295
00:15:03.905 --> 00:15:05.605
Now he was lame in both his feet.

296
00:15:08.025 --> 00:15:09.125
Now I want to, I wants

297
00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.325
to notice a couple things about this passage first

298
00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:13.005
before we dig too far into it.

299
00:15:13.535 --> 00:15:15.725
First, look at the initiative by David.

300
00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:18.895
David didn't go out

301
00:15:18.955 --> 00:15:22.055
and say, Hey, is anyone from Saul's house causing trouble?

302
00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:25.155
No. What did he say? He said,

303
00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:27.275
is there anyone from Saul's house that I can bless?

304
00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:32.705
Because remember at that time a new king comes in,

305
00:15:32.845 --> 00:15:37.105
he would've had all the previous regimes family executed so

306
00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:38.745
that none of 'em had a claim to the throne.

307
00:15:39.925 --> 00:15:42.425
And so he's walking around with that opportunity.

308
00:15:42.645 --> 00:15:44.145
But no, what does he do? He says, no.

309
00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:46.905
Is there anyone I can bless? He shows kindness.

310
00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:52.105
Why did he do it? Because of Jonathan's kindness to David

311
00:15:52.445 --> 00:15:55.185
and because Jonathan and David had made a covenant

312
00:15:57.545 --> 00:16:01.115
years before that, I'm gonna bless your family, Jonathan.

313
00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:03.915
Jonathan's like, Hey, when you're the king, bless my family.

314
00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:07.805
David's now the king. He looks for Jonathan's family

315
00:16:07.865 --> 00:16:10.045
and I'm going to bless them with that.

316
00:16:10.265 --> 00:16:13.685
He said kindness. That covenant loyalty kind of kindness.

317
00:16:15.325 --> 00:16:17.145
That's part of the reason. But the other reason is

318
00:16:17.145 --> 00:16:19.865
because David is truly showing the nature of

319
00:16:19.865 --> 00:16:21.585
what a king ought to be in Israel.

320
00:16:22.535 --> 00:16:24.985
Just listen to what Psalm 72 says it.

321
00:16:25.475 --> 00:16:28.825
Verse four, may he defend the cause of the poor

322
00:16:28.925 --> 00:16:31.665
of the people, give deliverance to the children

323
00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:33.505
of the needy, crush, the oppressor.

324
00:16:33.885 --> 00:16:36.065
He delivers the needy when he calls the poor.

325
00:16:36.285 --> 00:16:37.545
And him who has no helper.

326
00:16:37.725 --> 00:16:39.505
He has pity on the weak and the needy.

327
00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:41.745
He saves the lives of the needy.

328
00:16:41.745 --> 00:16:43.145
That's the way the king was supposed to be.

329
00:16:43.165 --> 00:16:45.105
And so David just saying, I wanna do that,

330
00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:52.255
but let's focus also a moment on Mephibosheth's condition.

331
00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:54.445
This is Jonathan's son.

332
00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:58.025
Did you see how it described his life?

333
00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:01.725
It says he was physically broken,

334
00:17:03.075 --> 00:17:04.955
crippled in his feet, lame in his feet.

335
00:17:05.145 --> 00:17:07.075
That actually happened. We kinda skimmed over it

336
00:17:07.075 --> 00:17:08.115
back in chapter four.

337
00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:11.915
On the day Jonathan was killed in the battle.

338
00:17:12.755 --> 00:17:15.195
Mephibosheth was being, well, he was five years old,

339
00:17:15.195 --> 00:17:16.995
being cared for by someone back home.

340
00:17:17.185 --> 00:17:19.515
They heard the news fled from the city

341
00:17:19.735 --> 00:17:22.075
and she drops this 5-year-old.

342
00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:23.795
Mephibosheth breaks his legs.

343
00:17:25.095 --> 00:17:26.915
That's why he is the way he is now.

344
00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:30.695
Years, years later, still crippled by that.

345
00:17:32.455 --> 00:17:33.715
And so he was physically broken.

346
00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.595
He was also socially isolated.

347
00:17:37.525 --> 00:17:40.435
Verse four says, he was living in a town called lo debar.

348
00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:41.955
That means nothing to us.

349
00:17:42.115 --> 00:17:43.155
'cause that's actually Hebrew word,

350
00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:46.075
but it literally means place of nothing.

351
00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:51.465
He's living in the middle of nowhere.

352
00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:55.745
You might say place of nothing. He's socially isolated.

353
00:17:56.055 --> 00:17:59.665
Plus he's relationally estranged. He's the grandson.

354
00:17:59.665 --> 00:18:01.945
Think about the grandson of the previous king

355
00:18:01.945 --> 00:18:03.185
who tried to kill the new king.

356
00:18:04.285 --> 00:18:09.195
So he's socially, relationally, materially impoverished.

357
00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:10.875
He can't work for himself.

358
00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:12.595
He needs care and provision from other people.

359
00:18:13.105 --> 00:18:15.715
He's really down on top of all that.

360
00:18:17.355 --> 00:18:18.725
He's emotionally damaged.

361
00:18:21.385 --> 00:18:24.695
Verse eight, what does he call himself in front of David?

362
00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:31.295
I'm a dead dog. Like the lowest of the low.

363
00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:34.175
The dogs were cast off. They were untouchable.

364
00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:36.575
They were worthless. And he's a dead one of those.

365
00:18:36.885 --> 00:18:40.785
He's as low. His view of himself is as low as he could go.

366
00:18:44.325 --> 00:18:49.245
Yet what did David do? Just imagine Mephibosheth.

367
00:18:49.265 --> 00:18:52.885
He hears these, these rattlings of the doorframe,

368
00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:55.565
and he hears these, these representatives

369
00:18:55.565 --> 00:18:57.285
of the king coming into his room.

370
00:18:57.465 --> 00:18:59.965
What's he thinking? He's thinking they're coming to get me.

371
00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:01.365
My time is finally up

372
00:19:01.505 --> 00:19:04.365
and he's walking into the throne room in front of David.

373
00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:06.525
What does he expect? He expects judgment.

374
00:19:08.765 --> 00:19:11.585
And David turns around and gives him assurance.

375
00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:17.785
Verse seven, do not fear. That's his first words, right?

376
00:19:19.235 --> 00:19:23.895
Do not fear. I'm not gonna hurt you. He gives him assurance.

377
00:19:24.155 --> 00:19:26.215
He also gives him restoration.

378
00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:28.415
He says, Hey, you know what all that Saul had,

379
00:19:28.635 --> 00:19:32.435
I'm gonna give that all to you more than Mephibosheth had

380
00:19:32.435 --> 00:19:34.115
ever had all these servants.

381
00:19:34.115 --> 00:19:37.315
Now he's got those in his family. He got restoration.

382
00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:38.795
He also got adoption.

383
00:19:38.925 --> 00:19:40.515
David said, you're gonna eat at my table.

384
00:19:40.695 --> 00:19:45.415
That's a place for family. He says, come on into my family.

385
00:19:45.675 --> 00:19:48.415
I'm going to adopt you. And he got provision.

386
00:19:48.635 --> 00:19:50.095
All of these Zeba

387
00:19:50.095 --> 00:19:52.495
and all his family, all his servants, they have

388
00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:55.095
to farm the land so that Mephibosheth has enough

389
00:19:55.095 --> 00:19:56.295
and his household has enough.

390
00:19:56.725 --> 00:19:58.415
Look at what David did.

391
00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:01.995
I mean David couldn't heal this man,

392
00:20:03.045 --> 00:20:05.585
but he brought him in, sat him at the table to

393
00:20:05.585 --> 00:20:07.105
where his disability was hidden.

394
00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:10.305
If everybody looks at that table, what do they see?

395
00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:12.025
That's one of his sons.

396
00:20:18.055 --> 00:20:23.045
God's kindness to Mephibosheth through David is stunning.

397
00:20:23.275 --> 00:20:25.805
It's Hesed covenant faithfulness

398
00:20:26.265 --> 00:20:28.365
to his son.

399
00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:31.725
And just think about what that teaches us about God.

400
00:20:33.715 --> 00:20:37.335
God seeks out the broken and the forgotten.

401
00:20:39.325 --> 00:20:40.985
It is abundantly clear right here.

402
00:20:43.465 --> 00:20:48.085
God's heart is to seek out the broken and the forgotten.

403
00:20:52.665 --> 00:20:57.415
This man 3000 years ago deserving

404
00:20:58.055 --> 00:21:00.855
judgment worth nothing in his own eyes.

405
00:21:04.085 --> 00:21:07.615
It's abundantly clear that God was seeking out Mephibosheth.

406
00:21:09.425 --> 00:21:12.845
But listen, that's why this is one of my favorites.

407
00:21:13.465 --> 00:21:15.565
Is this not true for us too?

408
00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:20.255
Is this not what God does for us

409
00:21:20.945 --> 00:21:22.295
today through his grace?

410
00:21:23.945 --> 00:21:25.325
Do you see the parallels here?

411
00:21:27.165 --> 00:21:30.265
Let Ephesians two does a great job of explaining this.

412
00:21:30.385 --> 00:21:32.065
Listen to what Ephesians two does

413
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:35.385
to describe your condition, my condition, all

414
00:21:35.385 --> 00:21:36.425
of humanity's condition.

415
00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:38.145
Listen to Ephesians two, one through three.

416
00:21:38.445 --> 00:21:41.025
You were dead in the trespasses

417
00:21:41.025 --> 00:21:43.265
and sins in which you once walked following the course

418
00:21:43.265 --> 00:21:45.745
of this world, following the prince of the power of the air,

419
00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:48.105
the spirits now at work in the sons of disobedience,

420
00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:51.865
among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,

421
00:21:52.385 --> 00:21:54.185
carrying out the desires of the body, the mind.

422
00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:56.825
We were by nature, children of wrath

423
00:21:58.155 --> 00:21:59.365
like the rest of mankind.

424
00:22:02.455 --> 00:22:04.915
So what are we spiritually broken?

425
00:22:05.665 --> 00:22:09.275
Cast off living in the wasteland of sin.

426
00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:13.075
We're enemies of God, we're feeling untouchable.

427
00:22:13.255 --> 00:22:16.875
We feel worthless. We're actually dead in our sins.

428
00:22:16.975 --> 00:22:19.355
Do you see the parallel? That's where Mephibosheth was.

429
00:22:19.415 --> 00:22:21.195
That's where you and I are spiritually.

430
00:22:21.575 --> 00:22:25.385
But God, Ephesians two, four says this,

431
00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:28.825
but God being rich in mercy

432
00:22:29.095 --> 00:22:31.585
because of the great love with which he loved us,

433
00:22:31.615 --> 00:22:33.905
even when we were dead in our trespasses,

434
00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:36.545
made us alive together with Christ by grace.

435
00:22:36.545 --> 00:22:39.305
You've been saved and raised us up with him

436
00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:41.705
and seeded us with him in the heavenly

437
00:22:41.705 --> 00:22:42.825
places in Christ Jesus.

438
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.905
So that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable

439
00:22:45.925 --> 00:22:50.665
riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

440
00:22:50.925 --> 00:22:52.945
Is that not stunningly glorious?

441
00:22:54.405 --> 00:22:56.665
We deserve nothing but judgment.

442
00:22:56.965 --> 00:22:59.425
We walk in that throne room, we're face down.

443
00:22:59.885 --> 00:23:02.505
No, we should get judgment. What do we get? Instead?

444
00:23:02.725 --> 00:23:05.945
He gives us assurance. By grace, you've been saved.

445
00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:08.225
It's not your effort or your performance.

446
00:23:08.565 --> 00:23:11.385
By grace, the foundation is solid by grace,

447
00:23:11.405 --> 00:23:13.825
you're assured He gives us restoration.

448
00:23:13.885 --> 00:23:17.185
We have far more than we ever could have imagined in him.

449
00:23:17.405 --> 00:23:18.705
He gives us adoption.

450
00:23:18.915 --> 00:23:21.345
We're now in Christ sons and daughters of the King.

451
00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:26.145
He gives us provision that we have this immeasurable riches

452
00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:28.185
with him in the heavenly places.

453
00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:31.945
That's what he gives us. Instead, he doesn't wait for us

454
00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:34.745
to clean ourselves up, crawl our way to the palace.

455
00:23:34.745 --> 00:23:38.465
Somehow he pursues us in our brokenness.

456
00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:42.585
And then he sends his son to carry us to the palace.

457
00:23:44.235 --> 00:23:47.005
This is the gospel in two Samuel nine.

458
00:23:50.385 --> 00:23:53.985
So here's the question. Do you see

459
00:23:54.185 --> 00:23:55.945
yourself as Mephibosheth?

460
00:23:59.665 --> 00:24:04.365
Like do you see yourself as desperate, as needy?

461
00:24:05.535 --> 00:24:09.705
Because the reality is you will not be redeemed

462
00:24:10.645 --> 00:24:12.035
until you acknowledge your need.

463
00:24:14.005 --> 00:24:15.335
Because you could sit there

464
00:24:15.335 --> 00:24:16.415
and think, no, I got it all together.

465
00:24:16.515 --> 00:24:21.235
I'm okay. I don't need anything. I'm good with God.

466
00:24:22.535 --> 00:24:26.595
I can make my way. You won't make it in

467
00:24:28.445 --> 00:24:31.235
until you acknowledge your need and you're desperate

468
00:24:31.235 --> 00:24:32.875
before him and say, God, I have nothing.

469
00:24:33.575 --> 00:24:36.355
I'm lost. I'm desperate. I need you.

470
00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:38.935
That's the first piece here.

471
00:24:42.425 --> 00:24:44.365
But then if you remember what we talked about last week,

472
00:24:46.155 --> 00:24:48.525
this has said kindness of God.

473
00:24:49.445 --> 00:24:52.695
When We receive that, it should amaze us, yes,

474
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:57.655
stunning, and then lead us to action.

475
00:24:59.555 --> 00:25:01.895
It should amaze us and lead us to action.

476
00:25:02.115 --> 00:25:05.575
And so just think about this in light of two Samuel nine,

477
00:25:06.115 --> 00:25:10.985
who in your life needs to hear that God chases

478
00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.345
after the forgotten and the broken?

479
00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:18.555
Like who's a mephibosheth in your life? It's you.

480
00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:23.275
But then also you can be David God showing his kindness

481
00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:25.035
to someone else through you.

482
00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:28.355
Who is it that needs to hear that God

483
00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:30.875
seeks out the broken and the forgotten?

484
00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:33.595
Maybe it's the the person that's overlooked at school

485
00:25:35.195 --> 00:25:36.335
or even here at church.

486
00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:41.235
Maybe it's that family member who feels like a failure.

487
00:25:44.815 --> 00:25:46.525
Maybe it's that neighbor going through the divorce

488
00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:48.205
and he feels really lonely right now.

489
00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:54.605
Maybe it's that person who just feels disqualified

490
00:25:54.605 --> 00:25:55.885
because of what they've done in their past.

491
00:25:59.735 --> 00:26:03.595
God showed his kindness to Mephibosheth through David.

492
00:26:04.725 --> 00:26:05.865
God could have done it on his own,

493
00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:08.425
but he used David through David.

494
00:26:09.165 --> 00:26:12.785
We can be that vessel of kindness to others

495
00:26:13.245 --> 00:26:15.265
as God has shown it to us.

496
00:26:15.715 --> 00:26:16.065
First.

497
00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:22.955
There's a warning here, though.

498
00:26:25.685 --> 00:26:27.905
I'm not gonna read all of chapter 10 in second Samuel,

499
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:31.555
but this chapter Reveals

500
00:26:32.485 --> 00:26:36.775
that our efforts to show this has said kindness of God

501
00:26:37.905 --> 00:26:40.485
can at times be tragically misunderstood.

502
00:26:42.345 --> 00:26:46.945
Chapter 10 10 shows us that that effort to show kindness

503
00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:50.705
to others can actually be misunderstood.

504
00:26:56.735 --> 00:26:58.825
Just look at verse two of chapter 10.

505
00:27:01.755 --> 00:27:03.165
I'll read verse one as well.

506
00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:05.725
After this, the king of the Ammonites died.

507
00:27:07.075 --> 00:27:10.005
Ammonites were an enemy of God's people nearby.

508
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.125
After this, the king of the mites died

509
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:14.285
and hanno, his son reigned in his place

510
00:27:14.985 --> 00:27:17.725
and David said, I will deal loyally.

511
00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:21.565
By the way, that word loyally is the same word as kindness

512
00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:26.595
in chapter nine that has said, David said,

513
00:27:26.595 --> 00:27:28.275
I wanna show has said kindness.

514
00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:31.275
I will deal loyally with Hanon.

515
00:27:31.375 --> 00:27:36.155
The son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me.

516
00:27:37.815 --> 00:27:42.295
So what's David doing here? It's the same way.

517
00:27:42.315 --> 00:27:45.575
He showed kindness to Mephibosheth.

518
00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:50.095
He's saying, I am going to do the same thing for this Hanon,

519
00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:51.775
the king of the Ammonites.

520
00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:55.335
Why? Because Han nun's father had showed kindness to David.

521
00:27:55.605 --> 00:27:56.975
David's like, I wanna pay him back.

522
00:27:57.015 --> 00:27:58.895
I wanna return the favor. He was kind to me.

523
00:27:58.895 --> 00:28:03.245
I wanna be kind to him. And so David sent representatives

524
00:28:03.245 --> 00:28:06.685
to Hanno who showed up

525
00:28:08.255 --> 00:28:11.355
and they were treated with skepticism and contempt.

526
00:28:13.665 --> 00:28:16.915
They were thinking David was trying to spy on the Ammonites.

527
00:28:19.655 --> 00:28:22.155
And they ended up humiliating David's men.

528
00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:26.535
They even began to hire other nations around them

529
00:28:26.535 --> 00:28:28.655
to help them fight against Israel.

530
00:28:32.845 --> 00:28:34.785
And it ended up tragic.

531
00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:37.785
They brought destruction upon themselves.

532
00:28:37.895 --> 00:28:41.265
They in the Amite worldview, they had no category

533
00:28:41.645 --> 00:28:42.665
for genuine kindness.

534
00:28:44.515 --> 00:28:46.525
Like they just assumed ulterior motives

535
00:28:46.545 --> 00:28:49.805
and they ended up paying the ultimate price for it.

536
00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:54.725
But let's just think about that for a second.

537
00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:59.105
Is that not the way the world often responds

538
00:28:59.105 --> 00:29:00.545
to Christian Love today?

539
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:07.685
Is it not similar? Like somehow in our sinful

540
00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:10.485
human nature, we find it easier

541
00:29:10.825 --> 00:29:14.405
to believe in manipulation rather than genuine kindness.

542
00:29:16.305 --> 00:29:17.435
When somebody does something kind

543
00:29:17.435 --> 00:29:18.475
like, what's your angle, man?

544
00:29:19.975 --> 00:29:21.425
Like what? What are you trying to get from me?

545
00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:25.425
Now, some of that is because we

546
00:29:25.425 --> 00:29:26.825
as Christians have not helped that process.

547
00:29:27.085 --> 00:29:28.585
We do love with strings attached

548
00:29:28.585 --> 00:29:29.745
sometimes, and that's a problem.

549
00:29:29.845 --> 00:29:32.705
We shouldn't do that. We should love just radically.

550
00:29:35.965 --> 00:29:39.305
But as we go about this pursuit of showing kindness,

551
00:29:39.815 --> 00:29:43.565
will some people assume

552
00:29:43.565 --> 00:29:44.845
that we have hidden agendas?

553
00:29:45.945 --> 00:29:48.475
Yes. Love them anyway.

554
00:29:51.425 --> 00:29:55.835
Will some people misinterpret our kindness as manipulation?

555
00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:58.275
Yes. Show kindness anyway.

556
00:30:01.535 --> 00:30:05.065
Will people reward our, he said with hostility,

557
00:30:06.225 --> 00:30:09.185
possibly show it anyway.

558
00:30:10.155 --> 00:30:13.375
Serve them anyway? You know why?

559
00:30:13.485 --> 00:30:15.135
Because that's what God does for us.

560
00:30:18.255 --> 00:30:20.395
Romans eight, Romans five, eight.

561
00:30:20.535 --> 00:30:21.915
God shows his love for us in

562
00:30:21.915 --> 00:30:23.995
that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

563
00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:25.715
So think about that.

564
00:30:26.695 --> 00:30:29.395
God sought you out when you were unable to come

565
00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:31.115
to him when you were his enemy.

566
00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:33.595
You were living in the wasteland of sin

567
00:30:34.615 --> 00:30:35.635
and he came after you.

568
00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:39.075
And so when someone misunderstands you, when someone comes

569
00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:41.515
to you and rejects you because of the kind, that's okay.

570
00:30:41.855 --> 00:30:44.155
You can still love him. You can still go after that.

571
00:30:44.295 --> 00:30:46.675
You can still care for them. Love their heart.

572
00:30:46.985 --> 00:30:49.435
Love them as a person. You can do what you can

573
00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:53.475
to show the kindness of God to them that you have received.

574
00:30:54.135 --> 00:30:58.285
Listen, that's one main way that the world will see

575
00:30:58.385 --> 00:31:02.125
and know that our God is truly scandalously

576
00:31:02.465 --> 00:31:04.125
and persistently kind.

577
00:31:06.225 --> 00:31:08.635
It's because we do it for them,

578
00:31:10.555 --> 00:31:11.805
because he did it for us.

579
00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:17.715
There's a scene in Luke 19.

580
00:31:19.295 --> 00:31:21.805
Jesus was passing through a town called Jericho,

581
00:31:24.065 --> 00:31:27.485
and he met a rich tax collector named Zacchaeus.

582
00:31:30.395 --> 00:31:33.645
Zacchaeus was very intrigued with this man, Jesus.

583
00:31:34.465 --> 00:31:38.165
So he was interested. Now,

584
00:31:38.165 --> 00:31:39.965
the way the Bible describes him was

585
00:31:39.965 --> 00:31:41.205
that he was a wee little man.

586
00:31:43.915 --> 00:31:45.005
This means he was short.

587
00:31:47.045 --> 00:31:51.355
And so he climbed up in a sycamore tree for the Lord.

588
00:31:51.415 --> 00:31:56.055
He wanted to see what's interesting here is that

589
00:31:56.075 --> 00:32:00.255
as the Savior passed that way, he looked up in that tree

590
00:32:01.515 --> 00:32:03.095
and he set, well, I'm gonna stop right there.

591
00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:04.095
Okay, we go too far.

592
00:32:04.915 --> 00:32:06.895
If you were a kid, you're singing that song right now.

593
00:32:11.945 --> 00:32:13.085
But he looked up in the tree

594
00:32:13.145 --> 00:32:15.765
and he, he named

595
00:32:17.215 --> 00:32:19.185
this outcast, broken man.

596
00:32:21.085 --> 00:32:23.265
We don't know. We assume Jesus had never met him.

597
00:32:23.635 --> 00:32:24.665
Jesus is God,

598
00:32:27.365 --> 00:32:30.425
but he looks up at this man who everyone else

599
00:32:30.935 --> 00:32:31.945
said is worthless.

600
00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:34.385
And he said, Zacchaeus.

601
00:32:35.935 --> 00:32:37.195
And then he not only said his

602
00:32:37.195 --> 00:32:38.315
name, he said, we're going to your house.

603
00:32:38.315 --> 00:32:43.215
Let's go hang out. Now, here again, I said it a little bit,

604
00:32:43.355 --> 00:32:47.855
but the religious folks were grumbling.

605
00:32:50.895 --> 00:32:53.845
You know who that guy is? Jesus.

606
00:32:53.985 --> 00:32:55.565
Why are you wasting your time with this guy?

607
00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:01.605
And Yet, Jesus showed kindness.

608
00:33:02.505 --> 00:33:02.925
Anyway,

609
00:33:07.605 --> 00:33:12.025
this forgotten, broken man looked down upon

610
00:33:12.045 --> 00:33:14.625
by society, looked down upon by everyone else.

611
00:33:15.695 --> 00:33:19.765
Jesus came after him. And you know why?

612
00:33:20.535 --> 00:33:21.805
Jesus gave us the reason?

613
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:25.885
Luke 1910, Jesus said, for the son of man came to seek

614
00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:30.825
and to save the lost notice, not just came

615
00:33:30.845 --> 00:33:35.545
to save, the lost came to seek and to save the lost.

616
00:33:35.565 --> 00:33:38.025
That's a pursuit. That's an effort to save.

617
00:33:38.325 --> 00:33:40.385
I'm coming after those who are forgotten.

618
00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:42.185
I'm going after those who are broken.

619
00:33:42.525 --> 00:33:44.985
I'm going after those who know they need a savior.

620
00:33:45.245 --> 00:33:46.425
That's who I'm coming for.

621
00:33:49.465 --> 00:33:51.275
This is what grace actually means.

622
00:33:52.915 --> 00:33:55.325
It's the love that seeks out the forgotten

623
00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:58.885
that makes room at the table for those who have nothing

624
00:33:58.905 --> 00:34:00.765
but empty hands and a broken past.

625
00:34:02.755 --> 00:34:07.285
This is the said of God that he would do that for us.

626
00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:09.925
May that be our heartbeat today.

627
00:34:12.445 --> 00:34:14.685
I invite you to bow your heads and pray towards that.

628
00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:18.805
End with me now. And here's how I want us

629
00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:19.925
to respond.

630
00:34:20.045 --> 00:34:21.725
I I, I don't claim to speak for God,

631
00:34:21.725 --> 00:34:23.845
but I believe by his word, he's led us

632
00:34:23.845 --> 00:34:27.085
to a couple things to reflect on.

633
00:34:27.085 --> 00:34:28.285
Maybe today you're sitting there

634
00:34:28.305 --> 00:34:30.685
and you don't know that love of God

635
00:34:33.135 --> 00:34:34.195
and you know you're forgotten.

636
00:34:34.215 --> 00:34:35.875
You know you're broken. You know you're outcast

637
00:34:35.935 --> 00:34:38.595
and you live in that wasteland of sin and you have no hope

638
00:34:38.855 --> 00:34:40.715
and you're trying to be good enough and you're exhausted.

639
00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:43.195
Listen, today, today,

640
00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:46.195
hear me, hear Jesus.

641
00:34:46.815 --> 00:34:49.875
He came to seek and to save the loss. That's you.

642
00:34:54.815 --> 00:34:57.035
And you're like, how could somebody be so kind?

643
00:34:57.505 --> 00:35:01.395
Yeah, he's the good God of the universe who loves you.

644
00:35:03.845 --> 00:35:05.385
You've never seen it here on this earth,

645
00:35:07.045 --> 00:35:09.305
but he proved it when he went to that cross for you.

646
00:35:11.285 --> 00:35:12.665
And so if that's you

647
00:35:12.665 --> 00:35:14.025
and you're like, I don't know that kind of love

648
00:35:14.615 --> 00:35:16.305
he's offering, receive it.

649
00:35:17.015 --> 00:35:19.945
Receive the covenant kindness of God for you,

650
00:35:19.975 --> 00:35:20.985
that he would live, die,

651
00:35:21.105 --> 00:35:22.185
and resurrect in your place

652
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:23.465
so that you could be with him forever.

653
00:35:27.835 --> 00:35:29.665
Let's Just rest in that. Receive that today.

654
00:35:34.405 --> 00:35:35.625
And if you already know that love

655
00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:38.445
and you've experienced the love of of God in his kindness

656
00:35:38.665 --> 00:35:42.005
for you, let today be an a refresher

657
00:35:44.435 --> 00:35:49.135
reminding you where you were dead, lost, forgotten,

658
00:35:49.485 --> 00:35:54.255
outcast, and he brought you in not

659
00:35:54.255 --> 00:35:55.615
because you cleaned yourself up first.

660
00:35:55.875 --> 00:35:59.575
He cleaned you up when he brought you in so

661
00:35:59.575 --> 00:36:03.775
that you can live a new life now and be with him forever.

662
00:36:06.795 --> 00:36:11.495
May that be what causes joy, that it's all his

663
00:36:13.365 --> 00:36:14.695
unshakeable foundation,

664
00:36:17.735 --> 00:36:20.575
abundant grace, kindness, and mercy.

665
00:36:22.905 --> 00:36:25.975
Thank you God for your grace, that we don't deserve this.

666
00:36:26.085 --> 00:36:29.735
It's a gift. That's grace. What we deserve is judgment.

667
00:36:30.075 --> 00:36:34.255
And you don't give that to us. That's mercy. See, thank you.

668
00:36:34.315 --> 00:36:34.535
God

669
00:36:39.245 --> 00:36:41.495
lead us in the way of everlasting as a result of that,

670
00:36:41.525 --> 00:36:44.775
lead us to worship you with all that we are as a result of

671
00:36:44.775 --> 00:36:47.455
that, lead us to speak boldly, to love radically.

672
00:36:47.515 --> 00:36:48.575
As a result of that.

673
00:36:51.755 --> 00:36:52.935
We don't do all of this.

674
00:36:52.955 --> 00:36:55.255
We don't sing and, and live and give and serve.

675
00:36:55.275 --> 00:36:58.375
We don't do all of that because we need you to love us.

676
00:36:58.435 --> 00:37:00.695
We do all of that because you already love us

677
00:37:06.475 --> 00:37:07.615
And we're free to do it now.

678
00:37:11.105 --> 00:37:12.375
Thank you, God. What a gift.
