00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.800
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.560
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.840
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.680
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.240
When Christ who is your life appears, then you will also appear with him. And,

6
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.420
Well, happy Sunday faith family.

7
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.900
It's always good to be together and to see you and to get to worship together.

8
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.060
The Lord's invited us into his presence. What a gift.

9
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.700
We get to do this together. My name's John. I'm one of the pastors here.

10
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.140
If I haven't met you yet, please come say hello. Love to meet you. Uh,

11
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
we've got plenty of other ways you can connect with someone out there or in the

12
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.300
seat back in front of you this fall if you're new.

13
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.220
We're studying through the Apostle Paul's letter to the Colossians,

14
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.220
and we are now into the body of the letter where it's showing us how Christ

15
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.060
above all actually applies in daily life. Last Sunday,

16
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.340
we began pulling this thread of how the philosophies and spiritual powers

17
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.460
were tempting that young church in Colossae away from the gospel of

18
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.900
Christ alone to be their salvation and their hope.

19
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.460
And so Paul reminded them and he reminded us as well that Christ was

20
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.940
and is superior to all of those other rulers and authorities.

21
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.260
No matter if they're material or spiritual, physical or spiritual,

22
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.440
he is over them all. Well,

23
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.920
we see another therefore in verse 16 today.

24
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.720
Remember we saw that last week as a marker, a transitionary word.

25
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.760
And and what we see this today leading us to is where Paul takes another step

26
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.960
in how these people were using these philosophies against the Gentile Christians

27
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.560
in Colossae. He says, here's how it's actually playing out.

28
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.320
Be aware that it wasn't just the powers and the spiritual authorities

29
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.960
that they were facing in the spiritual world.

30
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.720
It was also now we'll see people tempting the believers to

31
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.320
slip into a religious legalistic system rather than the gospel

32
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.090
into making their faith. Jesus plus anything else,

33
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.500
Jesus plus works Jesus plus Judaism,

34
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.540
Jesus plus a ritualistic calendar following Jesus plus

35
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.080
anything. Now that's not just a problem back then.

36
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.560
That's a problem for us just as much as it is today. Like

37
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.240
the idea that we can drift into the same temptation where we add things

38
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.360
onto our faith all the time

39
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.570
instead of relying solely on God's work in our place for our salvation,

40
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.370
for our continuing faith. We rely on all this other stuff,

41
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.170
adding onto it instead of just focusing on the Lord.

42
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.610
And we do that because we want to kind of justify ourselves.

43
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.330
We wanna qualify ourselves and say,

44
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.050
well of course I need to do this and this and this also, right?

45
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.450
Like to feel justified before the Lord. We'll do it that way.

46
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.650
Or we'll do it to disqualify someone else. Well,

47
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.030
they're not doing this, this or that or, or they're not doing these things.

48
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.790
Surely they're not a believer, right? That's what happens all over the place.

49
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.470
As we go beyond the Bible into self-made rules and

50
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.560
regulations, it's dangerous.

51
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.460
We'll see that today in God's word.

52
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.380
And so turn with me to Colossians chapter two again,

53
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.220
Colossians chapter two in the New Testament.

54
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.420
This week will be in verses 16 through 23 of chapter two,

55
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.180
which sets us up really well for next week in chapter three,

56
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.740
where we get even more practical, uh, through the rest of the book. But for now,

57
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.500
verses 16 through 23,

58
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.540
he's gonna focus in to continue this thread we began last week.

59
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.180
I'm gonna read the whole section first and we'll work back through it.

60
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.900
Remember what we saw last week again? 'cause he says therefore in verse 16,

61
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.060
what's he talking about?

62
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.620
He's talking about how Christ is superior to all these other spiritual powers

63
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.620
and worldly principles. Christ is above those.

64
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.660
Verse 16. Therefore,

65
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.710
let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with

66
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.110
regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.

67
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.710
These are a shadow of the things to come,

68
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.390
but the substance belongs to Christ.

69
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.470
Let no one disqualify you insisting on asceticism and worship of angels

70
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.750
going on in detail about visions puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind

71
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.390
and not holding fast to the head from whom the whole body nourished,

72
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.030
knit together through its joints and ligaments grows with a growth that is from

73
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.790
God. If, or you might say, since with Christ,

74
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.430
you died to the elemental spirits of the world.

75
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.070
Why as if you're still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?

76
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.950
Do not handle, do not taste,

77
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.310
do not touch referring to things that all perish as they're used according to

78
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.690
human precepts and teachings.

79
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.360
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and

80
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.440
asceticism and severity to the body.

81
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.920
But they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.

82
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.620
God, help us to see what you want us to see today. This is your work.

83
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.700
It's your word. We need you Holy Spirit,

84
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.980
to open our hearts and our minds and our eyes to see this

85
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.330
God make us good soil.

86
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.330
That we would receive this your word and it would plant and bear

87
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.330
hundred fold good fruit in our lives.

88
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.670
Teach us, God, we need you. This is confusing. There's hard things.

89
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.443
So God clarify,

90
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.470
make it abundantly clear in our hearts what you want from us and for us today.

91
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.990
In Jesus' authority we pray. Amen.

92
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.510
And so these things I just read were clearly being advocated all around the

93
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.590
church in colossae.

94
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.470
These religious teachers were walking around teaching this stuff and,

95
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.510
and some of those teachers were even passing judgment or it says

96
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.510
disqualifying others. It says there that word means to push out of bounds.

97
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.760
It means to rob of the prize they were,

98
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.360
they were using these practices and these requirements to gauge whether someone

99
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.050
was really a Christian or not. They're building fences and saying, well,

100
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.050
these things are, are proving that you're not a Christian. Well,

101
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.530
notice what these things are. Food, drink, festivals, Sabbath,

102
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.850
these were all very Jewish concepts, right?

103
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.780
And so these false teachers were advocating that a person essentially had to

104
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.620
become Jewish in order to prove their salvation to not be

105
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.460
disqualified from this faith.

106
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.910
But not only that, they went further.

107
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.070
They talked about worshiping angels and asceticism. Now,

108
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.830
that's a really big word. We don't know what that means. So often it,

109
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.150
it's simply a word that means denying yourself pleasure.

110
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.530
So people throughout the centuries have done this where it's, uh, like you,

111
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.010
you don't eat for a long period of time. You don't have a mattress you sleep on.

112
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.410
You don't get a coat when it's cold outside. It's, it's ace practices,

113
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.330
denial of self practices for the sake in their mind of,

114
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.450
of growth spiritually.

115
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.750
And so what we see then we put all this together in colossal,

116
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.070
there was probably some impure form of Judaism.

117
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.030
It was intermingled with some practices that other religions would do in kind of

118
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.990
mishmash together. But it was a form of Judaism nonetheless.

119
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.790
And these religious leaders were advocating that they,

120
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.630
that people needed to go back to the law,

121
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.510
to these ritualistic practices in order to gain some higher form of

122
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.710
spirituality. That's the context.

123
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.200
Paul then says, okay guys, hold up. Let me teach you some things here.

124
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.260
Hey church,

125
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.160
let me remind you of a few truths as you hear all of this stuff.

126
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.380
Here's the first one.

127
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.780
He reminded them that Christ is the fulfillment of the law.

128
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.970
Christ is the fulfillment of the law.

129
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.860
Now, where did I get that from this text? Well,

130
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.340
because so much of this Old Testament language is about the law here,

131
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.430
and it's talking about when or where they could drink this or that,

132
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.710
or wine or not, or,

133
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.910
or even eating laws like no eating pork or shellfish or

134
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.750
even boiling a goat in milk.

135
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.750
Like all those things were questions and laws that they had.

136
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.430
There were laws on festivals, new moons here, Sabbath.

137
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.100
And, and remember those three things were celebrations that were,

138
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.900
were meant to remember something. They were celebrations.

139
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.700
Israel was to have every couple years or every year or month or week to

140
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.540
remember God in some way. But eventually they started great,

141
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.620
but eventually morphed into just ritualistic religious practices that

142
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.940
they did just because they did 'em.

143
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.480
And what would happen is Jewish leaders back then especially, but even today,

144
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.560
would debate applications of all of these laws.

145
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.190
Like I said, it does happen today too. They have to debate whether, uh, uh,

146
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.630
a metal detector is lighting fire on the Sabbath.

147
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.110
They have to figure out the application.

148
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.750
There's debates about cheeseburgers going on right now,

149
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.670
like is that boiling a goat in its mother's metal?

150
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.150
Like have they have to apply all of these things?

151
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.990
And so these leaders would sit around and debate applications of the law.

152
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.030
And what we learned is that some of those leaders were

153
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.390
excluding gentile Christians because those people were not following the

154
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.550
strictest set of rules they could come up with.

155
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.280
They weren't doing all of these things. So they're out.

156
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.733
Now remember,

157
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.480
God's law was given to reflect God's character.

158
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.420
It was given as a covenant set of expectations for

159
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.780
his people, how to respond to him and how to treat one another.

160
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.700
And so it was good, we'll say that again later, but hear me.

161
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.380
It was not intended to be the end game.

162
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.960
God's law was not intended to be the end game set up the covenant

163
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.040
boundaries. But in the law itself,

164
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.400
it was pointing forward to something later,

165
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.840
to something that it was gonna fulfill it.

166
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.880
It was pointing forward to the Messiah.

167
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.900
It was pointing forward to who we know as Christ Jesus.

168
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.360
That's what Romans 10, four says. Christ is, is the end of,

169
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.000
or the culmination of the law for righteousness to everyone who

170
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.470
believes it was waiting for Christ.

171
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.080
In fact, Jesus himself said it this way In Matthew five 17 and 18,

172
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.440
Jesus says, do not think that I've come to abolish the law or the prophets.

173
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.880
I've not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.

174
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.990
For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota,

175
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.510
not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished.

176
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.030
Those were the smallest strokes of a pen in Hebrew and Greek, that those things,

177
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.030
every little piece of it, even the tiniest piece of the law, he says,

178
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.350
will be fulfilled. It'll be accomplished in me. He says,

179
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.980
then he goes on in verse 20. He says, for I tell you,

180
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.060
unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and the Pharisees,

181
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.380
you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

182
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.160
Now, that's a big uhoh moment for us right there. It should be.

183
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.230
'cause remember who the scribes and Pharisees were, right?

184
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.350
They were the best of the best. They were the the religious Navy Seals.

185
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.070
They did everything right. They were the the to the T,

186
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.310
every little iota and dot.

187
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.470
They were trying to figure out ways that they could build fences around even

188
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.510
that law. So they never even caught close to obeying that law.

189
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.910
They were the righteous of the righteous, you might say.

190
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.520
Yet Jesus, did you hear him?

191
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.840
He says that your righteousness high score must beat theirs.

192
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.840
And when you're playing that arcade game and you get a high score,

193
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.560
theirs was way higher. You gotta beat them.

194
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.630
You've gotta exceed their righteousness. And even further than that,

195
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.190
he went beyond that in the rest of Matthew five,

196
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.450
elevating the law by,

197
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.050
by as he takes six common beliefs and, and teachings that they had at the time.

198
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.890
And he elevates those going further where he applies it to people's hearts,

199
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.730
not just to their actions. You might know them, right? He says,

200
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.850
do not murder is what was commonly taught. But, but he says, I I say to you,

201
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.700
you don't even hate someone in your heart. You shouldn't even hate them.

202
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.900
Not about what you're not doing or not or doing because you can build fences

203
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.540
around that and try not to get close to that. But he's like,

204
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.950
but still it's in your heart. He does it with lust and adultery.

205
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.470
He does it with oaths and divorce and loving your enemies. He says,

206
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.790
it's not just about how you do things out there,

207
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.830
it's about what's even inside of you, whether it's godly or not.

208
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.800
And so when he takes it to that level, right,

209
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.160
there's gotta be something more here that he's talking about fulfilling the law.

210
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.540
Well,

211
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.960
the first way he fulfills the law is that he expands it beyond what it just

212
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.040
says. Like I I just described. He takes it to a deeper level.

213
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.760
It was merely an outline or a skeleton until Jesus showed up.

214
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.320
You might think of it that way, that it was, it was part, it was there,

215
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.920
the structure was it, but it was waiting for its fulfillment.

216
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.120
And he didn't eliminate it.

217
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.400
What he did is he fulfilled it and he just like put skin on it. You might say,

218
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.230
he said this, my life, my thoughts,

219
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:13.160
my actions is what it looks like to be a

220
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.240
new kingdom citizen,

221
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.480
to be someone who truly does follow God.

222
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.060
That it's about the actions, of course. Like we shouldn't murder,

223
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.900
we shouldn't commit adultery. But it's also about what's inside of you.

224
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.620
It's about your thoughts. It's about your desires. Do you even want to obey God?

225
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.730
That's a sign. 'cause you can keep yourself from doing certain things,

226
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.210
but do you want to do the right thing?

227
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:45.630
That's how he in one way fulfilled the law by taking it to its

228
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.190
fullest extent, showing us what it really means.

229
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.960
But that brings up a point when you look at the law like that,

230
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.200
man, that should make us feel insufficiency, shouldn't it?

231
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.440
If we're supposed to follow this?

232
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.080
And it's even about my thoughts and my actions, man, I'm so far from that.

233
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.320
There's no way you and I could live that perfectly at all, right?

234
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.880
Even the Pharisees couldn't.

235
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.200
They could build fences around all the obedience to these things,

236
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.880
but they couldn't change their hearts through those things.

237
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.880
So even they couldn't be perfect in these kinds of ways.

238
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.760
And so you should feel insufficient.

239
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.350
I should feel insufficient.

240
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.790
That's why the way Jesus fulfilled the law is not merely by broadening and

241
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.910
expanding it. He also fulfilled the law by perfectly obeying it for us.

242
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.000
He expanded it to the heart, but even his heart was perfect.

243
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.920
It's what Hebrews four talks about. He was tempted like us,

244
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.800
yet he never sinned. Even thoughts, even reactions,

245
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.120
even his demeanor never was sinful.

246
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.690
And so here's what that does.

247
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.090
It makes his death on the cross a sufficient

248
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.010
sacrifice to pay for our insufficiency,

249
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.650
for our sin, our depravity, our turning away from God.

250
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.290
It pays for the price for our sin.

251
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.050
That's what his perfection does. That's just like we saw last week, right?

252
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.810
That that record of debt that is standing against us, that's legal.

253
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.290
That's because we didn't follow the law perfectly.

254
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.770
So we got this rap sheet that's so full. What did he do with it on the cross?

255
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.530
Uh, Colossians two 14. He nailed it to the cross and put it away.

256
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.780
He set it aside by nailing it to the cross.

257
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.280
That's the record of debt that you and I have because we didn't follow the law

258
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.113
perfectly.

259
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.390
So that's good news that he fulfilled the law by living it perfectly for us.

260
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.450
And that sacrifice counts for us if we believe.

261
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.370
But there's also more to that sacrifice.

262
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.180
His death on the cross also then inaugurated the new covenant.

263
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.080
Now that word covenant is, is often interchangeable with the word law.

264
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.680
So you could think old testament, old covenant, old law.

265
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.920
It it's the new covenant, the new law, the New Testament you might say.

266
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.520
And think about the old one,

267
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.640
the old covenant required obedience to the law in order to ensure God's

268
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.713
blessings.

269
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.360
It also said you have these sacrificial systems that you have to go through

270
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.960
daily to cover your failure. That was the old covenant.

271
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.080
But the new covenant changes our hearts through the forgiving blood of Jesus

272
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.770
in our place. It's not about that stuff anymore.

273
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.730
It's what Ezekiel 36 predicted that God circumcised our hearts in

274
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.563
the new covenant.

275
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.820
You remember last week he talked a lot about how circumcision and, and how it's,

276
00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.700
it's just a pointing forward to Jesus. It's, it's not really worth anything.

277
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.140
This is what it's about. This circumcision of the heart.

278
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.500
God changing our heart, giving us a new heart, a new spirit,

279
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.220
something the law could never do

280
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.130
yet again. Remember the context.

281
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.600
The colossian Christians were being tempted to go back to at least some

282
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.000
of the requirements of the law in an effort to ensure that they were God's

283
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.480
people. They said,

284
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.800
certainly there's gotta be more to this right grace alone, Christ alone. No,

285
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.560
there's gotta be, I gotta do these things too, right?

286
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.040
Surely that 'cause that's in our nature, isn't it? We wanna try to create,

287
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.880
we wanna try to, to prove and to earn.

288
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.520
That's just in us as sinful humans.

289
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.930
It's kinda like when Peter went to Antioch.

290
00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.360
When he went to Antioch,

291
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.400
he began drifting back into Judaism because he was afraid of persecution from

292
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.300
the Jews. And it's this example right here.

293
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.620
And this is the way Paul responded to Peter in Galatians two.

294
00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.220
Peter's name was also CFUs. So, so know that he's talking about Peter.

295
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.220
But when CFUs came to Antioch, I,

296
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.220
Paul opposed him to his face because he stood condemned

297
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.430
for before certain men came from James, meaning Jews.

298
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.070
Peter was eating with the Gentiles. But when they came,

299
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:36.910
he drew back and separated himself fearing the circumcision party the Jews

300
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.550
and the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him so that even

301
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.870
Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.

302
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.510
But when I,

303
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.990
Paul saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel,

304
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.850
meaning pulling away from that acting differently because of Jews around you was

305
00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.010
not in step with the gospel. I said to fuss before them all,

306
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.490
if you though a Jew live like a gentile, meaning, Hey Peter,

307
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.210
you don't actually live like a Jew all the time,

308
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.890
just whenever those guys are around. If you don't live like a Gentile,

309
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.850
if you live like a Gentile, not like a Jew,

310
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.490
how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?

311
00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.570
We're Jews by birth, not Gentile sinners.

312
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.410
Yet we know a person is not justified by works of the law,

313
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.450
but through faith in Jesus Christ.

314
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.880
So we believe in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ,

315
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.800
not by works of the law. Because by works of the law, no one will be justified.

316
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.740
You can't earn it. You can't keep it.

317
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.260
No one will be justified made right before God by works of the law. So Peter,

318
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.020
why are you drifting back into it? That's why He Peter,

319
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.500
why Paul says here in Colossians two that Christ is the fulfillment of the law.

320
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.580
That you don't have to go back 'cause Christ did it for you.

321
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.210
And so that's the question again, I said it earlier,

322
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.760
does that mean that God's law is bad? If it's fulfilled?

323
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.730
Do we just kind of throw it away even?

324
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.550
Was it even good to begin with? Well yes,

325
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.430
because it shows God's character.

326
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.590
Because we see moral requirements repeated in the New Testament.

327
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.070
So it's affirming that it's good.

328
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.860
Even some of the civil and material stuff can apply to us. Yes.

329
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.100
But as we look at the law, we cannot think anything.

330
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.580
But Galatians two 16, by the works of the law, no one will be justified.

331
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.520
Meaning it's not salvific, it doesn't save you in any way.

332
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.120
We can't keep it like that. You can't earn salvation through it.

333
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.200
You can't keep salvation through it.

334
00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.640
You also shouldn't disqualify someone because of it, right?

335
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:52.960
It's not about that anymore.

336
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.220
We follow Christ now who takes the law higher and

337
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.060
fulfills it for us. That's our law now is Christ.

338
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.240
And that's what Paul shared next,

339
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.270
that not only is Christ the fulfillment of the law,

340
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.270
he's also the substance of the law's shadows.

341
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.430
That's the next part here. Christ is the substance of the shadows.

342
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.890
Back in Colossians two, that's verse 17 explicitly right? Look at it.

343
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.590
These all the, the law stuff,

344
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.950
these are a shadow of the things to come,

345
00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.110
but the substance belongs to Christ.

346
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.940
Think about it.

347
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.460
There's not a shadow without a figure or an object to cast the shadow, right?

348
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.680
So that's the idea is the shadow comes from someone something.

349
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.890
And so that's again, just like the law,

350
00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:56.170
it was not intended to be the end game here. All the ritualistic practices,

351
00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.090
all those religious things that were mentioned in the Old Testament law,

352
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.730
they were also not intended to be the end game.

353
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.220
The food and drink laws in the Old Testament merely a shadow of the substance of

354
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.053
Christ.

355
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.160
The festivals all over the Old Testament, even more clearly,

356
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.340
point to Christ. And just think of the Passover.

357
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:26.170
The Passover instituted because on the night that they were, uh,

358
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.090
that Israel was freed from the slavery of Egypt,

359
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.530
God miraculously set it all up, did it all. But that night he told them,

360
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:39.450
here's a meal you're going to eat and you're gonna remember me by as you go

361
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:43.730
forward. But here what it's about, you need to to kill a lamb,

362
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:44.850
a spotless lamb.

363
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:49.570
And you take that lamb's blood and you paint it on the doorframe of your house

364
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:54.930
so that when death passes by, it passes over your house,

365
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.530
that that lamb died for you. And so you don't have to die.

366
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:06.350
Is that not the gospel in Egypt,

367
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.330
right? That that's a picture,

368
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:14.020
a shadow of the substance of Christ

369
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.460
in the Sabbath. He mentions here in Colossians two, it was a Sabbath.

370
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.180
The Sabbath was one day a week that Israel was supposed to stop working

371
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.110
and trust God for his provision.

372
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.230
That was a massive marker in the world around them that nobody else did that

373
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.070
everybody else worked. Seven days kind of just drove themselves into the ground.

374
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.750
They said No six days we're gonna take one day off to remember God and trust

375
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.280
God. Even that points us forward to what?

376
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:51.000
Full rest in Christ, that he is our Sabbath rest, that we have eternal rest,

377
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.960
that we don't have to work anymore. He's given it to us.

378
00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.670
See, these are, these are shadows of the substance.

379
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.630
Even the tabernacle, the temple, the presence of God in a location.

380
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.150
You even think of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament where they had to

381
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.630
kill these animals certain ways and certain times all of that

382
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.360
shadows pointing to the substance of Christ.

383
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.260
Now I wanna be clear about something here. In saying all this, Paul or I,

384
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.180
we are not saying that Christianity has nothing to do with

385
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.880
Judaism. 'cause that can be it. We're just gonna cut it all off.

386
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.680
And it's just all about like that's heresy throughout the ages.

387
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.160
It's happened that way. We're gonna just use the New Testament only. Well,

388
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.280
no New Testament uses the Old Testament all the time.

389
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.960
So we're not saying it has nothing to do with Judaism. In reality,

390
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.320
Christianity is the fulfillment of Judaism

391
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.960
because it was an old covenant. Now it's a new covenant, a new age.

392
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.010
And that new covenant, the new age,

393
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.250
does not need the cultural practices

394
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.970
of, of Israel that was meant to be distinct,

395
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.650
meant to be monocultural. Everybody kinda looks the same, acts the same lives,

396
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.810
the same as a distinct marker from the rest of the world.

397
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.890
And that's what the law was meant to keep, to maintain.

398
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.910
We don't need those anymore because we are a worldwide family

399
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:32.030
now that supersedes location and time in Christ.

400
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.900
And so those things are not what we're about anymore.

401
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.260
We have a new covenant that covenants in Jesus who is the standard,

402
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.060
the fulfillment of the law. So we follow Christ. Now,

403
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.580
we don't follow those things anymore.

404
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:53.970
We are unified around the Messiah as our identity.

405
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.850
Not all these external practices,

406
00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.850
not anything that we could come up with on our own.

407
00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.290
Nothing that we would layer on top of our faith. No,

408
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.370
our identity is the Messiah. He's the marker.

409
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:10.330
His Holy Spirit in us as our brand, our our identity marker.

410
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.570
It's him not these other things.

411
00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:21.680
Again, that's why Paul argued so heavily that Christians do not need to go back

412
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:26.200
to Judaism or they don't need to go back to anything else that we could come up

413
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.520
with to complete quote unquote our faith. No.

414
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.320
All those things are copies of the real thing.

415
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:36.950
I read it this way this week,

416
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.630
don't lose the substance by grasping at the shadows.

417
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.190
We do that, whether it's Judaism or anything else,

418
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.870
we grasp at shadows instead of grasping at the substance of Christ.

419
00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.460
So he fulfills the law. He's the substance that the shadows were pointing to.

420
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.990
But there's one more piece of the puzzle here. It's the end of verse 23

421
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:11.360
here in Colossians two. It's what these shadowy things he's talking about,

422
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.360
it says that they are of no value in stopping the indulgence

423
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.520
of the flesh. That your flesh wants to do certain things.

424
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.570
Those things cannot stop it. What things? Verse 20

425
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.220
again, I said, it says, if with Christ,

426
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.940
that's really a condition that you already have. It assumes you have.

427
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.420
So you might say, since with Christ,

428
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.540
you died to the elemental spirits of the world.

429
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.300
Why as if you're still alive in the world,

430
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.360
do you submit to to regulations like do not handle, do not taste,

431
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.160
do not touch according to human precepts and teachings.

432
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.560
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom promoting self-made religion,

433
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.600
asceticism severity to the body.

434
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.800
But they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.

435
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.740
So these things that can't help you stop sinning.

436
00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.940
Like that's what people wanted.

437
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.870
They wanted us inherent in each one of us I think is this feeling of, yeah,

438
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.270
that's, that's wrong. Maybe we don't see everything as wrong,

439
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.390
but but there's a sense like, yeah, I shouldn't do that. There's kind of this,

440
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.910
this impression of God written on our hearts like, yeah, I shouldn't do that.

441
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.910
It's gonna hurt me, hurt somebody else. Okay?

442
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.010
And so there's a desire to stop sinning. But these things,

443
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.850
human made regulations, precepts, teachings, self-made religion,

444
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.690
denial of pleasures.

445
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:37.970
These are the things Paul says here are of no value in keeping

446
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:42.560
you from those thoughts and actions. Your sinful flesh wants to do, no value.

447
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.870
Zero. Now why did Paul even have to say that?

448
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.310
Why did he just come outta nowhere and say all these regulations?

449
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:57.340
Because there were teachers in colos saying who were promoting extra rules

450
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.540
and requirements, again, probably Jewish in nature. They're saying,

451
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.540
here's what you need to do if you want to stop sinning.

452
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.940
And they gave these lists, even that that do not handle taste, touch thing.

453
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.260
That's probably a slogan somewhere in Colossae.

454
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.540
They might have put it on the wall. Uh, and like, here, here's what you do.

455
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.610
Here's the answer. You wanna stop sinning? Don't touch that, don't handle that,

456
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.490
don't like, that's what they were saying.

457
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.730
These were probably the same people, by the way,

458
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.210
who claimed to have these higher experiences with angels where they were in this

459
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.250
spiritual state because they're so holy.

460
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.490
And they got this experience with an angel and he told them certain things that

461
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.650
they need to know that they need to tell everybody else to do.

462
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.690
And so what they would do is they'd walk around kinda high and mighty like,

463
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.523
guys,

464
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:46.290
I have experienced this angelic vision and you need to listen to me

465
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.010
because I have a deeper version of Christianity that nobody else has had ever

466
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:52.390
before. First of all,

467
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:56.590
be really careful if somebody says that nobody's ever thought this way before,

468
00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:01.840
Ooh. Like probably shouldn't. You know, that's what they were saying.

469
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.520
And these colossian Christians were being tempted to say, well,

470
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.200
maybe they do have legitimacy. Maybe I do need to listen to that.

471
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.160
Maybe I do need to apply what they're saying. Maybe I shouldn't touch that.

472
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.360
Maybe I shouldn't handle that. And they're going through that.

473
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.000
That's why Paul would say that. And look at how he responded to 'em. I mean,

474
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.920
look at verse 18. Let no one disqualify you.

475
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.640
Insisting on asceticism and worship of angels going on detail about visions

476
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.970
like the puffed up without reason by his sinuous mind. Like there's,

477
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.610
he's saying, guys, it's worthless. They're prideful, they're selfish.

478
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.440
Stop listening to them. There's, they have nothing to tell you

479
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.670
because verse 19, he says, they're out of line. They're adding onto the gospel.

480
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.910
They're not holding fast to Christ the head of the church.

481
00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.710
They're not holding fast to the gospel. They're adding on. It's unnecessary.

482
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.530
Don't listen to them. So what he says, instead,

483
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.770
if you really do wanna stop sinning, if you wanna stop indulging your flesh,

484
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.663
here's what you do.

485
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.130
You trust Christ to be the source of your transformation.

486
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.660
That's what he says here.

487
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.020
Christ is actually the source of that transformation you want.

488
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:23.400
Lemme explain how we get to that look in verse 20,

489
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:28.320
Paul says, if you believe then when Christ died, all your sin died with him.

490
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.730
When Christ was nailed on that cross.

491
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.090
If you have repented and believed in Jesus, your sin died too.

492
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.890
And then when he died, verse 20 says,

493
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.210
you also died to the elemental spirits of the world,

494
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.850
to these worldly philosophies,

495
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.890
these worldly principles that go against Christ or add onto Christ. He says,

496
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.520
you died to that. It's dead to you.

497
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.920
That's why you don't have to fall back into it. Because we saw last week,

498
00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.640
Christ in his death has already triumphed over all of those things.

499
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.150
You don't have to go back to that because they're dead.

500
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:10.280
You're dead to them. Not only are you dead or they're dead,

501
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.480
you're also a new creation. Now

502
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.530
he's made you a new creation. So when he, when he says this, Paul's like, guys,

503
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.250
those things are dead to you. You're a new creation now.

504
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:25.410
So why are you acting like you're not?

505
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.580
Why are you acting like you're still alive to that stuff?

506
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.540
Like that stuff's controlling. No, you're new. You're dead to that.

507
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.900
You're a new creation.

508
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.090
Now why are you still acting like you're alive to all those human made

509
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:45.010
traditions? All those things that you're trusting in to change you. Why?

510
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.000
Why are you being so violent with your body? By the way,

511
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.320
this has happened throughout the centuries. Monks, especially out in the desert,

512
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.720
they would whip themselves when they had a negative thought to try to train

513
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.920
themselves. They didn't sin anymore. I

514
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.350
had a seminary professor first week we we're even there.

515
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.030
He looks at us and he says, Hey, you guys need to take your tv,

516
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:15.650
go in the backyard, dig a hole and bury it. And we're all looking at him like,

517
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.090
what? What are you talking about?

518
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.360
And he's saying that because it's such a temptation that that's how radical

519
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.253
you need to be.

520
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.420
Is that not the same thing we just read here?

521
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.640
Like is it sinful to have a television?

522
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.320
Can you use a television for sinful purposes? Absolutely you can.

523
00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.320
But it's sinful to have a television that's do not handle, do not taste,

524
00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.520
do not touch, right? That's the same kind of idea here.

525
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.880
It's not about that anymore.

526
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.400
'cause Galatians five one reminds us,

527
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.680
it is for freedom that Christ has set us free.

528
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.760
So don't submit again to a yoke of slavery.

529
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.880
And what he's talking about there is submitting again to human made rules and

530
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.280
regulations, to following the law as your source of transformation.

531
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.760
That's what he's talking about. Don't get trapped again.

532
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.040
Don't get trapped by the law.

533
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:18.160
Don't get trapped by what people are telling you to do or not do.

534
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.200
'cause remember, those things cannot change you.

535
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.630
We all drift to that. We think, well this is gonna change me.

536
00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.270
This is gonna change me. No,

537
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.590
only Christ can change you through the spirit for the glory of the Father.

538
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.350
That's what Hebrews ten one says,

539
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.830
explicitly listen for the same kind language for sense.

540
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.910
The law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true

541
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.150
form of those realities.

542
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:51.550
It can never by the same sacrifice continually offered every year make perfect

543
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.630
those who draw near.

544
00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:00.070
It's a shadow so it can never make you perfect if you come near to it.

545
00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.230
Only Christ can.

546
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.230
At the first church, I pastored out of seminary out in Weatherford, Oklahoma.

547
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.310
We began having a lot of young families come.

548
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.070
And so we were gonna put in a playground like we should.

549
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.910
And so we looked around and the perfect place was right behind our church

550
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.790
building out there as a great area for it. But there was a big problem.

551
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.880
There was a massive sand plumb bush out there that was about 50 feet by 20

552
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.160
feet, 10 feet tall.

553
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.090
So we wanted to put it out there.

554
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:39.700
The problem was we had to get rid of that thing first. So what do we have to do?

555
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:45.460
Well first we had to cut back branches so we could even get to the trunk of the

556
00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.293
tree.

557
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.170
They cut through for hours these spines and sharp,

558
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.650
it was terrible, but cut it back enough to get to the trunk.

559
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.930
But what happens if we would just leave it cut back to the trunk like that?

560
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.460
What happens next? Branches grow right back.

561
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.200
So what did we need to do? We need to get to the root of the tree.

562
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.620
Now hear this, we did have to cut the branches back to get to the root, right?

563
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:22.690
We had to cut up a huge section of it so we get the backhoe in there and dig it

564
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.130
out because it took a huge hole to get that thing outta there.

565
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.370
But we had to cut branches. But the point was not cutting the branches.

566
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.770
The point was we had to get that root outta there.

567
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:39.000
Is that not the same thing we're talking about here? You can.

568
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.200
You can cut branches back in your life all you want, any self-made religion,

569
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.720
all these things that we're talking about this,

570
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:49.760
this severity to the body and and punishing yourself and and all that.

571
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.480
That's just cutting away branches. You can put the guard on your phone,

572
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.720
you can get rid of your tv, you can do whatever.

573
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.960
Those are just cutting away the branches.

574
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.410
They may seem like they work and they might for a season,

575
00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.820
but on their own, they really don't. In the end,

576
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:17.420
the only thing that will actually work to change this indulgence of the flesh

577
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.180
to a desire for God is what God alone can do.

578
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.980
It's what Galatians six 15 says. Just like last week,

579
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.260
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything.

580
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.260
Meaning you can do all the things you wanna do or not do all the actions or not

581
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.300
do the actions. What counts it says is a new creation.

582
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.130
Those things don't count. What counts is a new creation.

583
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:43.490
You gotta get to the root of the problem in your life

584
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:49.390
and that's the problem. The problem is your sinful heart.

585
00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.420
It's not that you have a TV or you don't.

586
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.340
It's not that you have all these things or you're doing these things or not.

587
00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.180
It's that your heart is still sinful.

588
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.540
It's it's second Corinthians five 17. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,

589
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.380
he is a new creation. The old has passed away,

590
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:11.260
died and the new has come. Galatians two 20,

591
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.060
I've been crucified. I've died to myself with Christ. So I no longer live,

592
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.820
but Christ lives in me. Meaning I have died.

593
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.060
I'm a new creation. And Christ,

594
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.820
the fulfillment of the law is who's living this out through me.

595
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.630
That's what changes your heart.

596
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.240
Now,

597
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.080
I know self-regulations and practices can be good and helpful,

598
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.760
right?

599
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.900
You shouldn't probably have this temptation sitting right in front of you.

600
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.340
You should probably get rid of it. Yes.

601
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:49.050
But you cannot do those things divorced from the source of true

602
00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.010
transformation on their own.

603
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:55.050
They won't work tied to Christ.

604
00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.650
Absolutely they can.

605
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:02.730
The only one who can truly change your heart is Christ

606
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.530
making you a new creation.

607
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:08.290
Listen,

608
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:12.940
if you're not a believer and you're just here 'cause your mom made you come,

609
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.130
you can try as hard as you want. You can want to stop sinning.

610
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.470
You can't

611
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.430
because that root is still bad.

612
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.250
And so you need a new root. You need a new heart.

613
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.520
And that comes through dying to self, turning from your sin,

614
00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.680
turning to Jesus as your salvation.

615
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.930
But listen, believer, you need to hear this just as much.

616
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.050
If you have given your life to Christ and his life,

617
00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:52.170
death and resurrection is your hope forever and ever. And you've said Jesus,

618
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:56.130
you are my Lord and savior. Know this.

619
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.050
Don't deny this. Don't. Don't live any other way.

620
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.690
The Holy Spirit has made you a new creation.

621
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:07.470
You are spiritually alive now. You don't have to go back.

622
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:11.550
You don't have to wait anymore. You don't have to fall into that stuff anymore.

623
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.830
So don't let anyone tempt you to fall back into that stuff.

624
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.430
Don't let anyone tempt you to,

625
00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:22.310
to build fences around your life and and dead legalism as the way you can keep

626
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:25.970
your salvation. It's about Christ.

627
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.250
Don't let anybody suck you into that. Let him change you. And then this.

628
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.700
Don't let your sin reign in your mortal body anymore.

629
00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:42.280
Because remember what happened when Christ died. Your sin died too.

630
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:48.170
So you don't have to sin anymore. The root is good.

631
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:53.170
Now you have the ability in Christ to choose right, to choose good.

632
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.610
So live in that.

633
00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:01.490
Live in that reality that you are spiritually alive to him and

634
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:04.210
you're dead to all those things. Think about the worst insult.

635
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:07.130
You can give somebody the worst.

636
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:10.130
You look at somebody in their face and you say, you're dead to me.

637
00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:17.370
Tell that to your sin. Tell that to your past,

638
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:22.170
to your shame, to your whatever else, to these, these temptations,

639
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.610
to keep going back to the law and the ritual saying, no, you're dead to me.

640
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:31.650
I follow Christ. Christ is in me the hope of glory. I have everything I need,

641
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:33.210
so I don't need you anymore.

642
00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.750
That's the good news that he does what the law could never do.

643
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.590
He does what those shadowy religious practices could never do.

644
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:43.750
He fulfills all of it.

645
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:48.340
So trust him with it and walk in his freedom like that.
