WEBVTT

1
00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.125
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:38.845
Uh, it's good to be back together.

3
00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:40.405
I missed being with you last week,

4
00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.685
but I wanna say a big thank you to Alan

5
00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:44.645
for handling the words so well.

6
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.405
Uh, talking about being peacemakers within the church

7
00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.525
as well as outside the church.

8
00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:51.245
It was powerful to listen to that this week.

9
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.605
But as we get into today's segment of

10
00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:58.565
what a realigned life in Christ looks like,

11
00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.645
I just wanna be upfront and tell you that out

12
00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:06.245
of the entire series, I feel the most

13
00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:09.085
unqualified to preach this topic.

14
00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:14.325
I mean, every week we've seen right,

15
00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:18.605
how far from Christ's standard we actually are, right?

16
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.565
We, we see it every week that we're far from

17
00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:23.645
what Jesus modeled for us.

18
00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.085
But today's topic of humility

19
00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:32.045
and its antithesis, pride has been one of my life's biggest

20
00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:36.325
struggles going all the way back.

21
00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:40.485
You think of my teen years just characterized by,

22
00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:42.525
by blatant selfishness.

23
00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:49.605
And I really loved the, uh, the notoriety

24
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.525
that would come with being good at sports or academics

25
00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:57.285
or even public speaking, even to my early,

26
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.725
early ministry where it was characterized by

27
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:02.685
so much self-sufficiency, like,

28
00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:04.085
I can make this church thing work

29
00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:05.765
with my talent, my resources.

30
00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:06.725
Yeah, let's do it.

31
00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:14.855
It shows up over the years through sermon illustrations

32
00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:16.615
where I make myself the hero.

33
00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:21.295
Rather than letting you see like the real

34
00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:25.895
and raw who John Wolgemuth actually is, kind of thing.

35
00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:28.775
Put up a facade. Lets you only see part.

36
00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:32.695
It looks good on the outside.

37
00:02:33.595 --> 00:02:35.215
Listen, those are all forms of pride,

38
00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:41.295
which means I need this sermon more than you do.

39
00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:45.495
But I would also imagine that like,

40
00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:47.935
like I'm not alone in those things.

41
00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:53.225
I would imagine that you probably felt a little bit

42
00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:54.825
of maybe some of those things I was

43
00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:55.905
talking about in your life.

44
00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:01.955
I also know there's things like false humility

45
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.435
that may be where you're at, where you cut yourself down

46
00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:15.145
to draw attention or

47
00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:19.585
you love to flaunt the way your body looks to others.

48
00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:26.315
Or even just a base level lack

49
00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:28.555
of dependence on God at all.

50
00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:35.675
That's all pride. That's why like

51
00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:38.395
this is so critical today that we need to get this.

52
00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:42.435
Because way back in, uh, the early three hundreds,

53
00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:46.435
Augustine said, pride is the beginning of sin.

54
00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.315
Like all sin, pride is the start of it.

55
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:52.915
Pride is the initiator of it.

56
00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.555
It's, it's that the, it is an a sin in itself,

57
00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.075
but it's also the root of all others.

58
00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:03.765
Like if we're arrogant or,

59
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.845
or we think that we're somehow above God's law, then man,

60
00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.685
that's gonna get us in trouble really fast.

61
00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:10.685
I deserve this, right?

62
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:14.805
I should have no, like that's where we go if we have pride.

63
00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.565
It's how adultery begins. It's how stealing begins.

64
00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:21.445
It's how lying begins. All of it comes from this pride.

65
00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:23.685
I get to do this, I want to do this.

66
00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:26.245
It's pride that then leads us down the road.

67
00:04:26.505 --> 00:04:29.565
And pride is what gets us further down the road than we

68
00:04:29.565 --> 00:04:30.645
ever thought we would be.

69
00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.515
That's why we all need this today desperately.

70
00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:42.755
I don't wanna train wreck my life.

71
00:04:43.075 --> 00:04:44.595
I don't wanna train wreck my ministry.

72
00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:50.375
And I don't want you to bring destruction into your

73
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:51.695
family, into your life.

74
00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:54.795
I want you to flourish.

75
00:04:57.995 --> 00:04:59.215
It doesn't happen through pride.

76
00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:07.775
And so we're gonna see today how poisonous pride really is.

77
00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:12.605
But thankfully, we'll also see the antidote

78
00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:19.085
and how Jesus himself modeled humility for us.

79
00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:22.085
So we need to pray to get started.

80
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:25.005
Before we dig into Romans 12, we need to ask God for help.

81
00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:26.165
So Lord, we pray today

82
00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:30.685
and in light of what you want to do

83
00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:35.165
through your word, Lord, it, it is hard words.

84
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:39.985
But Lord, we know that you have,

85
00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:44.225
you have written this for us.

86
00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:47.505
You've given us your word, you've given us your spirit.

87
00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:51.145
Now, your presence among us. And so Lord, speak, use it.

88
00:05:51.765 --> 00:05:56.275
Change us. Don't let any of us walk away from this moment

89
00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.315
the same way we walked in here.

90
00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:06.545
Make us humble. Lord, this is so deeply rooted in all of us.

91
00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:08.905
We've got to have the dynamite of the Holy Spirit

92
00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:11.025
and your word to blow this thing outta here

93
00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:13.305
or it's not going to leave.

94
00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:16.705
Change our hearts.

95
00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:19.105
God, make us more like you

96
00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:24.275
in Jesus authority over all things we pray.

97
00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:29.555
Amen. So here's where we're gonna go today.

98
00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.795
We're gonna finish Romans 12, verse 16.

99
00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.035
It's there on your notes. If you have the app

100
00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:36.875
where you have the paper copy, it's on the screens as we go

101
00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:37.955
through it, it'll be there.

102
00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:40.235
But, but just a couple simple phrases.

103
00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:44.155
Romans 1216 to finish that verse, here's what it says.

104
00:06:45.215 --> 00:06:48.675
Do not be haughty but associate with the lowly.

105
00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:52.235
Never be wise in your own sight.

106
00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:56.115
Do not be haughty or prideful,

107
00:06:57.455 --> 00:06:59.315
but associate with the lowly.

108
00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:03.575
Never be wise in your own sight.

109
00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:09.945
So again, remember Romans 12 is the Apostle Paul applying

110
00:07:10.045 --> 00:07:12.385
the gospel to those Christians, right?

111
00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:14.985
He's just showing them what a life transformed

112
00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:16.985
by Christ looks like day to day.

113
00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:20.385
This is Romans 12. This is Jesus perfectly living it out.

114
00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:23.545
Here's what we need to be more aligned with as we go.

115
00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:28.665
Well here he's emphasizing a believer's humility.

116
00:07:31.005 --> 00:07:35.065
And he says it in such a way that it's not an option for us

117
00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:36.665
to choose or reject.

118
00:07:37.855 --> 00:07:41.785
This is not an add-on to a, a super spiritual life.

119
00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:43.025
Like, oh man, those are the humble people.

120
00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:44.305
Those are the super Christians.

121
00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:47.825
This is a command for all of us.

122
00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:53.325
Clear from the first phrase, right?

123
00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:58.865
Do not be haughty. Do not be prideful. Do not be arrogant.

124
00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:00.945
Just blatantly clear.

125
00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:06.365
It's not the first time we've seen this though in Romans 12.

126
00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:10.805
It's just a basically a recap of

127
00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:13.405
what we saw back in verse three a few weeks ago.

128
00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:17.525
We saw this for by the grace given to me, I say to everyone

129
00:08:17.525 --> 00:08:20.845
among you not to think of himself more highly

130
00:08:21.395 --> 00:08:22.765
than he ought to think.

131
00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:27.385
That's the same concept here in verse 16, right?

132
00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:31.225
That your frame of mind can be so focused on yourself

133
00:08:31.335 --> 00:08:33.825
that you think you are better than everyone else,

134
00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:36.945
or you think you are awesome compared to everyone else.

135
00:08:37.095 --> 00:08:38.865
Like, I can get there, you can get there.

136
00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:42.385
It's possible that we can think more highly about

137
00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:43.625
ourselves than we ought to.

138
00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:48.365
We can be prideful.

139
00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:54.385
It's the arrogance that Paul warned the Philippian church

140
00:08:54.385 --> 00:08:57.575
about Philippians two verses three and four.

141
00:08:58.715 --> 00:09:02.495
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,

142
00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:06.635
but in humility, count others more

143
00:09:06.635 --> 00:09:07.995
significant than yourselves.

144
00:09:09.135 --> 00:09:11.195
Let each of you look not only to his own interests,

145
00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:13.155
but also to the interests of others.

146
00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:16.755
That's super interesting there

147
00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:20.635
because what he did is he linked selfishness

148
00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:24.195
with pride, with conceit.

149
00:09:26.235 --> 00:09:27.655
And so if you're looking for a test,

150
00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:29.415
this is just simple like, okay,

151
00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:30.415
how do I know if I'm prideful?

152
00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:33.215
Here's a simple test. Are you selfish right now?

153
00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:38.625
Are you being selfish in that moment? That's a test.

154
00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.025
He says, do nothing from selfish ambition

155
00:09:41.025 --> 00:09:43.865
or conceit meaning you're looking out for you.

156
00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:45.985
You're looking out for yourself.

157
00:09:48.105 --> 00:09:49.605
If you're ever selfish, that's pride.

158
00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:53.365
Because the posture of your heart in that moment is like,

159
00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:54.525
man, you're here to serve me.

160
00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:57.765
Everything's here about me. I am here to get what I want.

161
00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.245
Right? That is pride,

162
00:10:02.195 --> 00:10:04.505
which is a posture then that leads you

163
00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:06.545
to all those other sins as a result.

164
00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:10.065
I want this, I want this, I want this.

165
00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:12.625
So I'm gonna do this to you. I'm gonna ask you to do this.

166
00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:15.025
I'm going to demand this. I'm going to say this.

167
00:10:15.245 --> 00:10:16.425
So you think better about me.

168
00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:18.905
It's all selfishness, it's pride.

169
00:10:21.815 --> 00:10:24.115
That's why Augustine said it's the beginning of sin.

170
00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:32.745
That's why our response must be

171
00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:37.145
to reject the soul destroying poison of pride

172
00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:43.605
like this will destroy our souls if we let it

173
00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:45.325
go, reject it.

174
00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:49.355
It's a poison. It's in us from birth.

175
00:10:49.655 --> 00:10:52.315
Our selfish nature is bent towards this.

176
00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:55.475
It's a poison that is in there from birth.

177
00:10:55.535 --> 00:10:56.875
We must reject it.

178
00:10:57.075 --> 00:11:01.595
'cause here's the reality, Unchecked arrogance

179
00:11:02.305 --> 00:11:04.035
will shipwreck your faith.

180
00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:11.135
Unchecked arrogance will shipwreck your faith.

181
00:11:13.855 --> 00:11:15.635
Now, I'm not saying you can lose your salvation

182
00:11:16.985 --> 00:11:19.115
Because What God has started, God will finish.

183
00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:21.075
If God has saved you, he will save you.

184
00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:23.835
He promises that he will bring that about.

185
00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:28.395
What I'm saying is that pride is what leads you

186
00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.715
to refuse to repent when confronted over sin in your life.

187
00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:38.145
And that refusal reveals

188
00:11:38.415 --> 00:11:39.415
Something.

189
00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:44.925
Here's the truth, clearly exposed.

190
00:11:45.035 --> 00:11:46.525
It's in Matthew chapter 18.

191
00:11:47.065 --> 00:11:49.965
It it's typically known as the church discipline passage.

192
00:11:51.265 --> 00:11:53.005
But what you're gonna see here is what,

193
00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:55.405
what I've just talked about, what the word talks about.

194
00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:56.765
You'll see it in action.

195
00:11:58.315 --> 00:12:00.725
Matthew 18, verses 15 through 17.

196
00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:03.485
Listen to what Jesus says is Jesus teaching.

197
00:12:04.705 --> 00:12:07.525
He says, if your brother sins against you, go

198
00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:09.485
and tell him his fault between you and him alone.

199
00:12:10.785 --> 00:12:13.245
If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.

200
00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:17.055
But if he does not listen, take one

201
00:12:17.055 --> 00:12:18.215
or two others along with you

202
00:12:18.445 --> 00:12:20.775
that every charge may be established by the evidence

203
00:12:20.775 --> 00:12:21.895
of two or three witnesses.

204
00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:26.195
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.

205
00:12:27.645 --> 00:12:31.625
And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be

206
00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:34.705
to you as a gentile and a tax collector.

207
00:12:37.035 --> 00:12:38.135
So do you see what was happening?

208
00:12:40.815 --> 00:12:42.655
A person that you believe is a Christian brother

209
00:12:42.675 --> 00:12:46.255
or sister, sins against you.

210
00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:49.455
And so you go to them and you confront them over it

211
00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:51.535
and you tell them, here's what happened.

212
00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:53.055
It's not a preference issue.

213
00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:55.095
It's not like, I didn't like your shirt the other day.

214
00:12:55.095 --> 00:12:56.415
Right? You're not doing any of that stuff.

215
00:12:56.765 --> 00:13:00.175
It's a clear, in God's word, genuine sin.

216
00:13:00.315 --> 00:13:02.655
Here's what you did. Here's what it did to me.

217
00:13:03.035 --> 00:13:05.055
I'm confronting. And what was their response?

218
00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:09.355
Well, ideally they would listen,

219
00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.755
they would respond, they would repent.

220
00:13:10.775 --> 00:13:13.395
And then you've won. You've restored the relationship.

221
00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:14.875
That's the ideal. But Jesus says,

222
00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:15.995
that's not always what happens.

223
00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:24.455
We don't know exactly how this person responded negatively,

224
00:13:24.515 --> 00:13:29.425
but, but maybe it was something like that person comes

225
00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:31.305
to them and says, Hey brother, listen, this was a sin.

226
00:13:31.525 --> 00:13:32.825
It hurt me. Here's what you did.

227
00:13:33.325 --> 00:13:35.345
Nah, man, that's, that's not a sin.

228
00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:39.545
I don't, I don't think you're interpreting that right, man.

229
00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:40.985
Man, you're just being legalistic.

230
00:13:42.305 --> 00:13:44.315
Stop, you're, you're pushing it too far, man.

231
00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:45.715
No, listen, that's not that big a deal.

232
00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:49.245
Why are you making it a big deal? It doesn't hurt that bad.

233
00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:52.125
Like why? We don't know what they said.

234
00:13:52.145 --> 00:13:54.285
But that's the picture we get here.

235
00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:56.885
And what does all that sound like?

236
00:13:59.325 --> 00:14:03.385
It's pride. It's pride that no, no, I'm not wrong.

237
00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:09.755
Well, what happens next? Well, that person

238
00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:12.595
who brought the sin forward, the confronter

239
00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:14.635
because they love the person.

240
00:14:15.785 --> 00:14:19.755
They bring one or two with them to just make sure

241
00:14:19.755 --> 00:14:20.875
that they're hearing everything right.

242
00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:22.235
Like, man, maybe I missed it.

243
00:14:22.235 --> 00:14:24.355
Maybe, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

244
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:27.395
And can we get some objective observers here and and listen

245
00:14:27.415 --> 00:14:28.875
and, and talk it out and think it through.

246
00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:31.955
And maybe we're both wrong maybe, but let's figure it out.

247
00:14:33.775 --> 00:14:34.915
Here's what I believe happened.

248
00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:37.195
Here's the sin that I believe happened yet again.

249
00:14:37.195 --> 00:14:40.035
What was the response in Matthew 18?

250
00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:41.635
Ideally the response is that

251
00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:43.115
that person, oh yep, I was wrong.

252
00:14:43.255 --> 00:14:45.195
I'm sorry, repent restored.

253
00:14:47.865 --> 00:14:50.845
But that isn't what happened here.

254
00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:54.645
Again, a prideful

255
00:14:54.755 --> 00:14:55.755
Refusal.

256
00:14:59.225 --> 00:15:00.775
Third step involves the church.

257
00:15:02.155 --> 00:15:05.015
But notice if they even refuse that.

258
00:15:05.725 --> 00:15:08.375
What did verse 17 say about that person

259
00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:10.775
who then even refuses that

260
00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:17.545
Jesus said treat them as a gentile and a tax collector.

261
00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:24.085
Those were catchall terms for people who are

262
00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:25.125
outside the church,

263
00:15:27.395 --> 00:15:30.485
essentially unbelievers you

264
00:15:30.485 --> 00:15:31.485
Might say.

265
00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:37.485
And so I wanna be clear what Jesus just said.

266
00:15:39.655 --> 00:15:42.665
He's not saying that we know for sure

267
00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:44.425
that person is an unbeliever

268
00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:47.685
because ultimately we don't know.

269
00:15:47.685 --> 00:15:49.245
Like I don't know any of you sitting right here.

270
00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:51.325
Like I'm just assuming I'm kind of reading the fruit.

271
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:52.845
I'm like, okay, yeah, I probably

272
00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.565
but, but like we don't know.

273
00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:55.885
It's between you and God.

274
00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:57.405
We have plenty of occasions

275
00:15:57.405 --> 00:15:59.685
where people have been acting like believers saying they're

276
00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:02.125
believers and on the last day they end up not believers.

277
00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:04.245
Like that's the reality of it.

278
00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:08.165
And so I don't know if somebody refuses to repent, repent,

279
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.885
repent, all those things like I don't know, that's

280
00:16:10.885 --> 00:16:12.045
between them and God.

281
00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:14.525
But they certainly are acting like one

282
00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:21.645
again.

283
00:16:21.745 --> 00:16:24.925
Why? Because of their pride.

284
00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:31.575
Refusing to see, listen again.

285
00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:32.975
If you refuse to see

286
00:16:32.975 --> 00:16:35.495
that your sin is separating you from God,

287
00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:41.075
if you refuse to see that your sin is hurting those

288
00:16:41.095 --> 00:16:43.235
around you, that's just arrogance.

289
00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:52.815
And it gives evidence that as far as we can tell, again,

290
00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:54.575
we don't know for sure, we hope we're wrong.

291
00:16:54.715 --> 00:16:56.095
But as far as we can tell,

292
00:16:56.275 --> 00:16:58.175
the Holy Spirit is not active in your life

293
00:16:58.175 --> 00:16:59.895
because Jesus promised the Holy Spirit was

294
00:16:59.895 --> 00:17:00.935
gonna convict of sin.

295
00:17:03.435 --> 00:17:06.375
And refusing that seeming to refuse that over

296
00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:08.815
and over means like, well, we is the Holy Spirit there.

297
00:17:08.815 --> 00:17:10.175
Which means they're not a believer.

298
00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:16.095
That's why we must reject pride,

299
00:17:16.095 --> 00:17:18.935
because eternity may be in the balance.

300
00:17:21.735 --> 00:17:25.115
It may be revealing something about your soul that is not

301
00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:26.875
eternally good.

302
00:17:31.515 --> 00:17:33.875
'cause remember why Satan was thrown outta heaven.

303
00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:38.035
Isaiah 14 says that Satan fell from heaven

304
00:17:38.145 --> 00:17:39.795
because of his pride.

305
00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.835
He wanted to be God. He wanted to sit on the throne.

306
00:17:43.905 --> 00:17:45.915
He's like, why does he get to and none of us do?

307
00:17:46.055 --> 00:17:49.765
He wanted and he was cast out of heaven because of pride.

308
00:17:54.495 --> 00:17:59.065
Listen, I don't want you, I don't want anyone

309
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:02.585
to get to that last day where you're standing before Jesus

310
00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:05.265
and in that moment you get exposed as a fraud.

311
00:18:08.035 --> 00:18:09.935
But Jesus, didn't we do all these things in your name?

312
00:18:09.935 --> 00:18:12.015
Didn't we do all these great things? He's like away from me.

313
00:18:12.095 --> 00:18:17.005
I never knew you because

314
00:18:17.025 --> 00:18:18.365
you never humbled yourself

315
00:18:18.385 --> 00:18:19.385
Before me.

316
00:18:24.775 --> 00:18:26.675
Listen, if you don't humble yourself before the

317
00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:30.935
Lord, Which is revealed as you humble yourself

318
00:18:30.935 --> 00:18:35.215
before other people, like if you don't humble yourself

319
00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:39.445
before the Lord beware eternity, that poison

320
00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:41.685
of pride will destroy your soul.

321
00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:47.995
So there's an eternal part of this that we cannot deny.

322
00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:49.955
We can't move past, like there's something here

323
00:18:49.955 --> 00:18:51.435
eternally we have to be aware of.

324
00:18:51.535 --> 00:18:54.155
But I also, not only eternally, I don't want you

325
00:18:54.155 --> 00:18:58.835
to suffer the consequences of a life lived in prideful,

326
00:18:58.835 --> 00:19:02.515
selfish focus, that it brings carnage in your life.

327
00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:06.635
Like if you just live about me, it's about me.

328
00:19:06.635 --> 00:19:09.955
It's about me. Everyone is damaged around

329
00:19:09.955 --> 00:19:10.955
You.

330
00:19:11.355 --> 00:19:12.355
I

331
00:19:13.515 --> 00:19:14.515
Want you to flourish.

332
00:19:16.235 --> 00:19:17.435
I want those around you to flourish.

333
00:19:17.515 --> 00:19:19.675
I want those around you to feel blessed and loved

334
00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:21.755
because your, your posture is towards them

335
00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:25.395
and it's sacrificial towards like that humble stance

336
00:19:26.135 --> 00:19:28.555
brings life to those around you.

337
00:19:30.145 --> 00:19:32.575
Pride only takes and takes and takes.

338
00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:38.015
Okay, so how do we get there?

339
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.575
We've identified the problem.

340
00:19:43.275 --> 00:19:45.845
Well, thankfully, verse 16 doesn't just stop in verse

341
00:19:45.945 --> 00:19:47.485
six with that first phrase.

342
00:19:49.265 --> 00:19:51.405
It also shares the antidote

343
00:19:52.305 --> 00:19:53.825
To The poison of pride.

344
00:19:55.145 --> 00:19:56.805
It moves from negative to positive.

345
00:19:56.805 --> 00:19:59.685
It says, do not be haughty but associate with the lowly.

346
00:19:59.685 --> 00:20:01.365
That's a contrasting statement.

347
00:20:01.365 --> 00:20:04.525
That word in the middle is a compare contrast word.

348
00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:08.445
Don't be prideful. Instead associate with the lowly.

349
00:20:10.885 --> 00:20:14.135
Okay? That word associate means be led by or

350
00:20:14.275 --> 00:20:15.695
or carried away with.

351
00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:18.415
It's similar to what we talked about a couple weeks ago

352
00:20:18.415 --> 00:20:21.055
with, with hospitality that you don't just tolerate people,

353
00:20:21.315 --> 00:20:24.175
you affectionately build relationships with them.

354
00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:27.695
You care, you circle up, you become friends, right?

355
00:20:27.695 --> 00:20:30.735
That's what we're talking about here, associating

356
00:20:30.765 --> 00:20:32.215
with the lowly.

357
00:20:32.215 --> 00:20:35.055
Well, next question, who are the lowly?

358
00:20:37.775 --> 00:20:39.985
Well, that word in the New Testament is used about people

359
00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:41.105
who are two things.

360
00:20:41.445 --> 00:20:45.065
One in a position socially that's low.

361
00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:49.365
But it's also used about people who are humble.

362
00:20:49.755 --> 00:20:51.165
Like you know those people in

363
00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:52.285
your life, those who are humble.

364
00:20:52.745 --> 00:20:54.565
That's what it's saying. They are lowly.

365
00:20:55.425 --> 00:20:56.725
So don't think it's a negative term.

366
00:20:56.725 --> 00:20:59.125
It's, it's an unfortunate word in English, but,

367
00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:00.885
but it, it doesn't mean anything about value.

368
00:21:01.995 --> 00:21:06.765
It's often set in contrast to proud or rich or mighty.

369
00:21:07.145 --> 00:21:08.525
And so you take the opposite of that,

370
00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:09.645
what we're talking about, humility.

371
00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.325
Lowly is poor, weak, humble.

372
00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:18.705
They're the uneducated, the social outcasts.

373
00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.665
The ones with no connections, no influence.

374
00:21:21.725 --> 00:21:23.665
The widow, the orphan, the stranger,

375
00:21:23.765 --> 00:21:27.385
the one Jesus said in Matthew 25, the least of these,

376
00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:33.865
Again, not talking about value in any way

377
00:21:33.865 --> 00:21:37.345
because what verse 16 doesn't say is show pity

378
00:21:37.345 --> 00:21:39.985
to those people or help those people like you have a lot.

379
00:21:40.045 --> 00:21:42.465
So give them money. Like that's not what it says at all.

380
00:21:42.605 --> 00:21:45.625
It says instead we are to associate with them.

381
00:21:45.885 --> 00:21:47.305
We are to come alongside them.

382
00:21:47.445 --> 00:21:50.025
We are to become their companions, their friends.

383
00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:54.585
We are to be with them like seeing them, sources of joy,

384
00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:56.905
sources of wisdom, learn from them.

385
00:21:57.055 --> 00:21:59.785
They have much to offer us. That's what it's talking about.

386
00:22:00.605 --> 00:22:04.025
In fact, the people in this category

387
00:22:05.315 --> 00:22:09.505
often have spiritual riches that those who are proud

388
00:22:09.525 --> 00:22:10.025
and wealthy

389
00:22:10.615 --> 00:22:15.565
lack, just think about it.

390
00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:20.855
They know their need. They have no delusions

391
00:22:21.115 --> 00:22:22.295
of self-sufficiency.

392
00:22:24.775 --> 00:22:28.785
They understand grace in a way that those

393
00:22:28.805 --> 00:22:30.785
who are maybe successful in the eyes

394
00:22:30.785 --> 00:22:31.905
of the world don't understand.

395
00:22:34.095 --> 00:22:35.755
And so we have a lot to learn when we

396
00:22:35.755 --> 00:22:37.395
associate with people like that.

397
00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:39.915
We are enriched as we do that.

398
00:22:39.935 --> 00:22:42.115
We learn desperate dependence.

399
00:22:42.115 --> 00:22:43.195
Our church talks about that all the time.

400
00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:45.435
We learn it whenever we're with people

401
00:22:45.695 --> 00:22:46.875
who are in that place.

402
00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:55.495
So here's the point. We in contrast to being prideful

403
00:22:55.495 --> 00:22:59.615
and the poison that is must treasure the unassuming company

404
00:22:59.635 --> 00:23:03.495
of the humble, like we need to treasure

405
00:23:05.315 --> 00:23:08.775
the unassuming company of the humble,

406
00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:12.135
like those who are quiet, those who are weak, those

407
00:23:12.135 --> 00:23:17.115
who are poor, treasure time with them,

408
00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:21.445
Don't just tolerate treasure.

409
00:23:21.675 --> 00:23:26.365
This is again where the standard of Jesus described

410
00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:30.645
by Romans 12 is so radically counter-cultural.

411
00:23:32.695 --> 00:23:36.095
'cause this is Jesus' standard here, associate with the low.

412
00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:38.415
This is where it completely flies against

413
00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:40.615
what we live every day.

414
00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:44.335
'cause what it does is it exposes

415
00:23:44.335 --> 00:23:47.445
that we often measure from the bottom up in our lives,

416
00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:51.595
like we're, we're measuring by the world's standard.

417
00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:54.155
Like we're, we're way off.

418
00:23:56.365 --> 00:23:57.725
'cause here's what the world says to do.

419
00:24:00.655 --> 00:24:04.565
Everything around us teaches us to climb the social ladder,

420
00:24:06.185 --> 00:24:08.525
to network with the influential,

421
00:24:10.925 --> 00:24:13.465
to schmooze those who can like advance our career

422
00:24:13.725 --> 00:24:15.385
or boost our status, right?

423
00:24:15.385 --> 00:24:16.625
And get a right group. So I

424
00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:17.785
gotta stand in this group over here.

425
00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:18.945
Oh look, I'm talking to these

426
00:24:18.945 --> 00:24:19.985
people, but those people came in.

427
00:24:19.985 --> 00:24:21.145
I gotta go over there, right?

428
00:24:21.145 --> 00:24:24.025
Like that's what the world says. But hear me.

429
00:24:25.565 --> 00:24:29.225
Who you seek out reveals what you value.

430
00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:36.705
Who you seek out reveals what you value.

431
00:24:38.075 --> 00:24:40.905
Pride gravitates towards status.

432
00:24:43.835 --> 00:24:45.675
Humility seeks out need.

433
00:24:47.905 --> 00:24:50.365
Who needs me right now? Who needs something right now?

434
00:24:50.585 --> 00:24:52.965
Not who can provide something for me right now?

435
00:24:53.065 --> 00:24:57.445
Who needs something I can fulfill right now?

436
00:24:59.305 --> 00:25:01.485
And isn't, isn't this what Jesus modeled for us?

437
00:25:02.915 --> 00:25:04.925
Like isn't this how Jesus lived his life?

438
00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:09.165
If, if we're looking at the standard, this is

439
00:25:09.165 --> 00:25:10.245
how Jesus did it, right?

440
00:25:10.245 --> 00:25:13.845
Matthew 1930, Jesus said, many who are first will be last.

441
00:25:15.175 --> 00:25:19.665
And the last, first Matthew

442
00:25:19.665 --> 00:25:23.625
2028, the son of man, Jesus came not to be served

443
00:25:23.925 --> 00:25:24.585
but to serve

444
00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:31.275
Philippians two, talking about his incarnation.

445
00:25:31.275 --> 00:25:34.875
Verse seven says, he emptied himself, he set aside the glory

446
00:25:34.905 --> 00:25:38.035
that he had and took the form of a servant,

447
00:25:42.135 --> 00:25:45.585
born among the animals surrounded by shepherds,

448
00:25:47.465 --> 00:25:49.845
raised in the backwater town of Nazareth,

449
00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:53.185
eventually hanging out with fishermen

450
00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:57.745
and tax collectors, not just speaking a word to a leper

451
00:25:57.745 --> 00:26:01.065
to heal them, but actually touching a leper to heal them.

452
00:26:03.095 --> 00:26:05.555
Listen, if we're gonna be like Jesus, we have to go

453
00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:10.355
where Jesus went to go

454
00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:11.635
where he is.

455
00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.705
Not in a fake way, not in a patronizing way.

456
00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.305
In an associating way.

457
00:26:19.445 --> 00:26:22.545
The scripture says like real valuing,

458
00:26:23.225 --> 00:26:25.945
recognizing other people saying, come on in, come on in.

459
00:26:25.945 --> 00:26:27.425
Because here's the, here's the truth.

460
00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:31.225
There are no unimportant members in the body of Christ.

461
00:26:33.995 --> 00:26:37.165
There's not a high and low in the kingdom of God.

462
00:26:38.225 --> 00:26:40.165
I'm not more important to the kingdom of God than you are.

463
00:26:40.455 --> 00:26:42.125
She's not more important than he is like

464
00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:43.365
that's not at at all.

465
00:26:43.585 --> 00:26:46.325
We are all, there's one king on the throne

466
00:26:46.465 --> 00:26:48.605
and the rest of us are just beggars Who found bread?

467
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:55.545
And here's this, this, this, this got me this week

468
00:26:58.615 --> 00:27:03.385
when we associate with the, the category, again,

469
00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:06.105
not value, but the category of those who are humble,

470
00:27:06.165 --> 00:27:09.465
the lowly, when we associate with them, it's just really

471
00:27:09.465 --> 00:27:11.905
where all of us should be anyway.

472
00:27:14.635 --> 00:27:17.215
If there's a king and it's not me, it's not you,

473
00:27:18.075 --> 00:27:19.635
It Then we are all down here.

474
00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:25.075
We're all lowly. So let's stop acting like we're not.

475
00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:30.405
And let's be lowly together, humble before the king.

476
00:27:35.355 --> 00:27:36.215
But again, man,

477
00:27:37.075 --> 00:27:38.695
That's Not the way the world thinks, is it?

478
00:27:41.675 --> 00:27:43.135
You don't associate with a lowly.

479
00:27:43.365 --> 00:27:44.775
They can't give anything to you.

480
00:27:44.805 --> 00:27:49.025
They can't do anything for you. So you don't do this.

481
00:27:50.915 --> 00:27:51.935
And here's the truth. You

482
00:27:51.935 --> 00:27:55.655
and I have marinated in that selfish, prideful,

483
00:27:55.655 --> 00:27:58.575
wealthy culture most if not all of our lives.

484
00:27:58.835 --> 00:28:01.295
And so it is really difficult for us

485
00:28:01.715 --> 00:28:05.775
to think differently than that for us not

486
00:28:05.775 --> 00:28:08.535
to just get caught up in this status game

487
00:28:08.955 --> 00:28:10.535
and not think like Jesus.

488
00:28:12.145 --> 00:28:16.155
It's easy for us to get there. It's hard to admit weakness.

489
00:28:16.615 --> 00:28:21.435
So we need Christ to reshape our minds,

490
00:28:22.895 --> 00:28:24.595
to redo our thoughts.

491
00:28:26.515 --> 00:28:27.715
Remember all the way back in verse two,

492
00:28:29.845 --> 00:28:32.145
do not be conformed to this world.

493
00:28:32.645 --> 00:28:35.345
Be transformed by the renewal of your mind

494
00:28:36.525 --> 00:28:38.285
by different thinking.

495
00:28:40.745 --> 00:28:42.555
Similar here in verse 16, right?

496
00:28:42.725 --> 00:28:47.475
Never be wise in your own sight. It's pride.

497
00:28:50.935 --> 00:28:54.545
It's not saying abandon all thinking.

498
00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:57.385
Stop learning. That's not what this is saying.

499
00:28:57.405 --> 00:28:59.585
God gave us minds to foster, to build, to grow.

500
00:28:59.645 --> 00:29:02.185
That's what we should be doing with our minds.

501
00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:04.105
What this is is a warning

502
00:29:04.645 --> 00:29:07.985
to abandon the deadly delusion of self wisdom.

503
00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:15.325
That this delusion that we are wise in ourselves is deadly

504
00:29:15.325 --> 00:29:16.685
and we should abandon it.

505
00:29:20.335 --> 00:29:24.075
We cannot think that our wisdom is sufficient.

506
00:29:26.235 --> 00:29:30.375
We cannot think that our understanding needs no correction.

507
00:29:32.275 --> 00:29:37.245
We cannot think that, that we, we,

508
00:29:37.245 --> 00:29:38.685
we can't think that I don't need input,

509
00:29:40.835 --> 00:29:41.925
that I don't need help,

510
00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:45.405
that my perspective is the final word.

511
00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:48.765
That's all delusions of self wisdom.

512
00:29:48.835 --> 00:29:51.885
That that we have some prideful version of

513
00:29:51.885 --> 00:29:53.005
who we think we are and

514
00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:55.525
what we can think about being wise in my own sight

515
00:29:55.525 --> 00:29:56.645
says I'm the final authority.

516
00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:01.785
I don't need anybody else. I certainly don't need

517
00:30:01.875 --> 00:30:03.105
God's word to correct me.

518
00:30:03.425 --> 00:30:04.665
I can figure this out myself.

519
00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:06.185
Listen, that's not merely foolish.

520
00:30:06.295 --> 00:30:09.145
That is rebellion against God. Almighty

521
00:30:14.315 --> 00:30:15.395
Proverbs speaks to this.

522
00:30:16.675 --> 00:30:19.275
Proverbs one, seven says, the fear of the Lord

523
00:30:20.255 --> 00:30:24.845
is the beginning of knowledge only.

524
00:30:25.055 --> 00:30:27.685
Fools despise wisdom and instruction.

525
00:30:32.595 --> 00:30:34.945
Pride makes you fear being wrong,

526
00:30:36.415 --> 00:30:41.025
fear being shown up, fear being corrected.

527
00:30:43.665 --> 00:30:46.165
And you only end up being unreachable,

528
00:30:46.595 --> 00:30:48.285
unteachable and unbearable.

529
00:30:52.845 --> 00:30:57.115
Humility on the other hand, humility makes you

530
00:30:57.225 --> 00:30:59.595
fear being on your own.

531
00:31:02.965 --> 00:31:05.305
It makes you fear a lack of counsel.

532
00:31:07.045 --> 00:31:10.835
It makes you fear being outside of God's word

533
00:31:13.775 --> 00:31:18.635
and you end up being more fruitful and wiser

534
00:31:19.295 --> 00:31:20.595
and your life flourishes.

535
00:31:24.825 --> 00:31:27.735
Don't hear me say that. You're losing your ability to think.

536
00:31:29.595 --> 00:31:32.535
You're gaining the ability to think God's thoughts

537
00:31:32.785 --> 00:31:36.265
after him, which is the definition of wisdom.

538
00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:41.745
How would God think about my life and my day?

539
00:31:42.745 --> 00:31:45.745
I wanna think those thoughts. How's he doing that?

540
00:31:45.925 --> 00:31:50.375
That's wisdom. You're gaining the ability to do that

541
00:31:50.715 --> 00:31:53.295
as you listen to him and his people and his word.

542
00:31:55.755 --> 00:32:00.155
'cause here's the reality. Sin has

543
00:32:00.225 --> 00:32:02.595
corrupted every facet of our lives.

544
00:32:03.935 --> 00:32:05.375
It Touches everything.

545
00:32:07.015 --> 00:32:09.595
And so we need the word of God to correct us.

546
00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:12.555
We need the spirit of God to guide us.

547
00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:15.555
We need the people of God to counsel us.

548
00:32:16.975 --> 00:32:19.315
And ultimately we need the, the God of the universe

549
00:32:19.415 --> 00:32:21.355
to completely reshape our hearts.

550
00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:25.955
We need him to change everything about our lives.

551
00:32:26.115 --> 00:32:28.595
'cause that's the only true antidote to the poison of pride.

552
00:32:28.745 --> 00:32:30.155
It's the gospel of Jesus Christ.

553
00:32:31.695 --> 00:32:32.985
It's so deep rooted in there.

554
00:32:33.215 --> 00:32:35.705
It's so saturated in the world around us.

555
00:32:35.755 --> 00:32:38.385
There is nothing we can do to remove it ourselves.

556
00:32:38.535 --> 00:32:41.525
Only God has to remove it. And here's how he does that.

557
00:32:42.715 --> 00:32:44.285
Like when we stop for a second

558
00:32:44.785 --> 00:32:47.045
and consider what God has done for us

559
00:32:50.515 --> 00:32:54.015
and we just stop and think about how, how we brought nothing

560
00:32:54.115 --> 00:32:58.975
to the table except the sin that made salvation necessary,

561
00:33:01.275 --> 00:33:02.605
that should just blow our minds

562
00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:04.205
and humble us from the very beginning.

563
00:33:06.785 --> 00:33:09.675
Like if we honestly assess our lives and we look around

564
00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:12.835
and we think about how far from God we are, how prideful,

565
00:33:12.935 --> 00:33:15.755
how selfish, all of these things, how much we actually are,

566
00:33:15.895 --> 00:33:17.555
and then we reflect on the grace

567
00:33:17.775 --> 00:33:20.955
and mercy of God toward us, even as his enemies,

568
00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.955
that he would say, you're my enemy.

569
00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:26.635
I'm gonna bring you into my family by my son's life.

570
00:33:27.055 --> 00:33:29.275
I'm gonna bring you in. Like if we think about that,

571
00:33:29.345 --> 00:33:30.715
that should make us the most humble

572
00:33:30.715 --> 00:33:31.915
people on the face of the earth, right?

573
00:33:33.195 --> 00:33:35.405
Nothing we deserve. There's no way we could earn it.

574
00:33:35.585 --> 00:33:38.045
We just had all against God.

575
00:33:38.145 --> 00:33:40.565
And he said, no, no, come on, you're mine.

576
00:33:44.235 --> 00:33:46.935
Why would we walk around preening and pretentious?

577
00:33:47.035 --> 00:33:48.295
Why would we think we have anything

578
00:33:48.295 --> 00:33:49.615
awesome to bring to the table?

579
00:33:49.875 --> 00:33:50.975
It is all God.

580
00:33:53.105 --> 00:33:56.685
And so we should be humble like God, just think about this.

581
00:33:57.185 --> 00:34:00.645
God saved you. God saved

582
00:34:00.785 --> 00:34:02.685
me like his enemy.

583
00:34:02.985 --> 00:34:04.965
God looked at me and said, I'm saving you,

584
00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:06.525
paying for it with my son.

585
00:34:07.035 --> 00:34:10.325
Like how could I not fall in my face in

586
00:34:10.565 --> 00:34:11.565
Response to that?

587
00:34:16.705 --> 00:34:19.845
So again, these, these commands here in Romans 12

588
00:34:21.875 --> 00:34:25.495
reject pride, embrace the lowly abandon self wisdom.

589
00:34:25.765 --> 00:34:28.295
They, they are not burdens to bear.

590
00:34:30.265 --> 00:34:31.815
These Are gifts to receive

591
00:34:34.075 --> 00:34:39.045
Because These will lead us out of the prison of pride

592
00:34:39.345 --> 00:34:40.925
and self-sufficiency.

593
00:34:41.305 --> 00:34:46.085
And they will lead us into the joyful freedom of humility

594
00:34:46.385 --> 00:34:48.125
and fellowship with God and with others.

595
00:34:51.595 --> 00:34:53.445
Because Here's what James four, six

596
00:34:53.445 --> 00:34:57.325
Says, God opposes the

597
00:34:57.325 --> 00:35:00.805
Proud, But gives grace to the humble.

598
00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.345
I don't want God opposed to

599
00:35:05.345 --> 00:35:06.345
Me.

600
00:35:10.695 --> 00:35:12.655
I wanna take a simple parable of Jesus

601
00:35:12.795 --> 00:35:13.935
to close our time today.

602
00:35:17.095 --> 00:35:18.945
This is a story you've probably heard before.

603
00:35:19.215 --> 00:35:22.265
It's actually so outrageous it, it kind of makes me chuckle.

604
00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:26.925
It's actually kind of funny the the way Jesus says it.

605
00:35:29.365 --> 00:35:31.505
But here's what I hope we hear it

606
00:35:31.505 --> 00:35:33.665
and read it with a little differently today with,

607
00:35:33.695 --> 00:35:35.025
with open eyes and hearts.

608
00:35:35.085 --> 00:35:38.245
Now in light of what God has shown us in his word,

609
00:35:38.465 --> 00:35:39.405
how we hear this,

610
00:35:43.425 --> 00:35:46.045
and as I read it, I would invite you just to ask God

611
00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:49.405
to reveal where you see yourself

612
00:35:52.795 --> 00:35:55.055
and then maybe where you should see yourself.

613
00:35:58.655 --> 00:36:00.905
This is Luke 18, nine through 14.

614
00:36:02.555 --> 00:36:04.545
Jesus also told this parable to some

615
00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:07.785
who trusted in themselves that they were righteous

616
00:36:08.925 --> 00:36:10.665
and treated others with contempt.

617
00:36:12.685 --> 00:36:14.545
Two men went up into the temple to pray.

618
00:36:15.525 --> 00:36:18.225
One a Pharisee and the other attacks collector.

619
00:36:19.405 --> 00:36:23.385
The Pharisee standing by himself prayed.

620
00:36:23.385 --> 00:36:27.905
Thus, God, I thank you that I am not like other men,

621
00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:32.705
extortioners, unjust, adulterers

622
00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:36.545
or even like this tax collector.

623
00:36:38.595 --> 00:36:42.635
I fast twice a week. I give ties of all that I give.

624
00:36:47.215 --> 00:36:50.955
But the tax collector standing far off

625
00:36:52.845 --> 00:36:55.715
would not even lift up his eyes to heaven.

626
00:36:58.215 --> 00:37:02.195
But he beat his chest saying, God, be merciful

627
00:37:02.215 --> 00:37:03.715
to me a sinner.

628
00:37:06.835 --> 00:37:10.955
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified

629
00:37:12.415 --> 00:37:13.475
rather than the other.

630
00:37:16.115 --> 00:37:20.095
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,

631
00:37:22.995 --> 00:37:24.295
but the one who exalts,

632
00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:28.535
humbles himself will be exalted.

633
00:37:31.765 --> 00:37:35.935
Lord, we come to you through your word

634
00:37:36.035 --> 00:37:38.655
and asking you humbly

635
00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:43.095
to reveal to us where our pride

636
00:37:45.165 --> 00:37:47.695
permeates every part of our lives.

637
00:37:53.035 --> 00:37:57.695
So God, I pray you would reveal that poison

638
00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:01.975
where it is, how deeply it is embedded in our lives.

639
00:38:01.995 --> 00:38:05.655
And Lord, you'd rip it out, replant

640
00:38:06.615 --> 00:38:10.215
humility in our hearts that we, we'd be willing to share,

641
00:38:10.215 --> 00:38:12.055
willing to open our lives, willing to,

642
00:38:12.195 --> 00:38:13.735
to not put on a facade

643
00:38:13.755 --> 00:38:17.655
and a fake image of, of who we really are.

644
00:38:17.755 --> 00:38:19.855
God, that we just be real who we are

645
00:38:19.855 --> 00:38:23.375
because we already in Christ are accepted before you.

646
00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:24.975
We don't have to be accepted by anybody else,

647
00:38:27.355 --> 00:38:31.935
but Lord, that humility, God,

648
00:38:31.935 --> 00:38:34.775
we know you've promised that that would change

649
00:38:35.575 --> 00:38:37.165
everything in our lives.

650
00:38:40.945 --> 00:38:43.685
But God, it's hard to admit weakness.

651
00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:45.485
It's hard to be in that place.

652
00:38:45.915 --> 00:38:49.965
It's hard for me to not love myself more than I should.

653
00:38:54.995 --> 00:38:56.575
So we come to you together, Lord,

654
00:38:56.635 --> 00:38:58.975
and I pray for every one of us that we would all

655
00:39:01.975 --> 00:39:04.175
recognize the need for humility

656
00:39:04.195 --> 00:39:07.455
and we would all walk towards you more humbly,

657
00:39:09.265 --> 00:39:12.295
crucifying ourselves, crucifying the pride

658
00:39:13.635 --> 00:39:16.055
to see others is more significant, to serve others

659
00:39:16.515 --> 00:39:19.095
to confess and repent of sin where we need to,

660
00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:21.535
even the small things that it wouldn't just be

661
00:39:22.065 --> 00:39:23.215
about us all the time.

662
00:39:24.325 --> 00:39:25.935
That the world would see something different.

663
00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:34.455
Or maybe church, maybe you, today's you're here

664
00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:36.095
and you recognize you've never

665
00:39:36.095 --> 00:39:37.415
humbled yourself before the Lord.

666
00:39:37.555 --> 00:39:38.855
You've played the church game,

667
00:39:39.235 --> 00:39:41.575
but you've never humbled yourself before God.

668
00:39:44.835 --> 00:39:46.375
And today you see your need for that,

669
00:39:46.435 --> 00:39:47.855
and you see that He listen.

670
00:39:47.935 --> 00:39:51.815
I hope you see it, that he's offered you forgiveness for

671
00:39:51.815 --> 00:39:55.695
that pride, forgiveness for that rebellion against him.

672
00:39:56.285 --> 00:39:58.495
He's offering it and you just have to receive it.

673
00:39:58.515 --> 00:40:01.215
You just have to look at him and say, God, I'm yours.

674
00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:08.655
Pray you do that today. Just walk into

675
00:40:08.655 --> 00:40:10.855
that freedom outta the prison of pride,

676
00:40:15.195 --> 00:40:16.175
self-importance.

677
00:40:17.965 --> 00:40:19.935
Just realize that it's only about his

678
00:40:19.935 --> 00:40:21.295
importance, it's about him.

679
00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:27.295
So that's what we're gonna sing.

680
00:40:27.715 --> 00:40:30.935
Christ, be magnified, pray that you would

681
00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:35.175
And that we live that way.

682
00:40:35.315 --> 00:40:37.935
So if you're able to stand together, let's magnify the one

683
00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:38.815
who is worthy of it.
