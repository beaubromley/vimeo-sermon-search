1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.200
Well, good evening.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.300
Why do I always have to say good evening

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.600
twice? Because the first time you don't say good evening back good

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.900
evening.

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.600
Thank you. I'm glad you guys are here. This is going to be a very very special night.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.800
If you're a guest with us, and this is

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.700
your first time to attend. We would love to have a

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.200
Record of your visit and we've I like

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.100
to say that it's not an accident that you've joined us tonight that we pray that

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.400
you're here. So you're an answer to our prayers. And so there is

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.100
a QR code on that seat back right in front

12
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.700
of you and if you'll just click a picture of that then it'll take you to a website where

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.300
you can fill out a form because we'd love to have a record of your visit. I

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.200
want to share with you that this is the third of

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.400
four weeks where we will be looking at topics that

16
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.600
are very popular popular and well

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.500
discussed in the culture and next week.

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.700
We'll be our final week. We will look very briefly at two

19
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.600
things. We're going to look at climate change

20
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
and our response to that as biblical

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
stewards, but we're also going to talk about a

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
very practical way for us as Disciples

23
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.300
of Jesus Christ to respond to someone who may

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.500
disagree with us. We've talked about different issues

25
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.100
and but sometimes when we talk

26
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.000
about those issues, we've not discussed. Okay, how do I conduct

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
myself in the Bible is very

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
Clear how a believer in Jesus Christ should have a conversation

29
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.700
and we have an apologetic

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
and we can promote and provide

31
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.100
that apologetic. But how do we do it in a manner

32
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.000
that is most like Christ. And so we'll talk about that next week this week.

33
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.900
We're discussing a religious liberty and I

34
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.100
want to start off by saying that you have

35
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100
to have crawled under a rock for a long

36
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000
period of time not to have identified the fact that the

37
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
culture concerning religious liberty seems

38
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.900
to be shifting.

39
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.100
And it's shifting with such a

40
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.400
huge extent and

41
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.300
with such a great velocity that it looks

42
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.600
like that Christianity that Believers in

43
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.500
Jesus are headed toward a head-on

44
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.800
collision with the culture. And so these

45
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400
are two completely different World Views and

46
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.300
we have to discuss. How do we

47
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.900
respond? If in fact the progressive liberal

48
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.200
agenda becomes the

49
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400
prevailing moral agenda for my whole

50
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.600
life and for all of our Lives the judeo-christian moral

51
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
ethic has been the predominant or the prevailing

52
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.800
culture and that seems to be shifting. It seems

53
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.000
to be helped Along by some and

54
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.100
influencers in our

55
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.500
day. But but what happens if the the

56
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.100
new morality becomes the prevailing morality

57
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.500
and prevailing morality doesn't

58
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.600
mean the true morality or even the

59
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.100
Biblical morality as a matter of

60
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.400
fact, for example, the past Pastor

61
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.100
John and the elders have asked me to to tell you that they

62
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.800
have prepared a statement concerning question 8:20.

63
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.200
Now, that's the proposition that's coming up

64
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.400
legalizing recreational use of marijuana for

65
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.600
people 21. Oh years of age and older and so

66
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.900
they they have prepared a statement and you can find that statement at

67
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.700
the information desk in the back and also on

68
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.200
our website. So let me

69
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.400
give you a background as to how we got here tonight.

70
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.700
First of all, I was studying because

71
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.300
I thought I was going to be the presenter.

72
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.400
For this evening, and and I

73
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.300
I know a lot of things about a lot of things. I

74
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.300
just don't know much about this topic. So I was reading this letter

75
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.300
right here, which was given to me as a gift Pastor John

76
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.100
gives the staff a book and I asked for this

77
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.300
one because I knew that we would be talking about these issues. And so

78
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.900
I was reading the right chapter on religious liberty and

79
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.300
really enjoying it's a great read

80
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.300
how many of you don't have a copy of the

81
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.200
resources lists. If you don't they're in

82
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.400
the back and there's going to there's plenty but I was

83
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.200
reading from Bruce ashford's book

84
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.100
Letters to an American

85
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.000
Christian and I thought you know, why don't I

86
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.500
just contact this guy if he'd be available to come and I don't

87
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.800
have thoughts like that, but I thought because of video conferencing maybe

88
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.500
we could we could arrange something and so

89
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.800
I sent him an email and by the way,

90
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.600
It seems to me that the the greater influence and

91
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.900
the greater number of letters. You

92
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.400
have behind your name the less likely you

93
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.500
are to return an anonymous email and guess what

94
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.200
he returns my email. He says I would

95
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.300
be glad to do that. And so the guy who wrote the

96
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.400
book in fact, he's written a number of different books our staff

97
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.600
went through together as a staff the gospel

98
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.400
of our King, which is also written by Dr. Ashford.

99
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.300
So that's how

100
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.600
we got to this this video conferencing tonight.

101
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.700
And so I will be interviewing Dr. Bruce

102
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.500
Ashford. He's an author a speaker a

103
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.000
columnist and a speech writer.

104
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.400
He's author or co-authored six different trade

105
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.100
books and three different academic books. This is

106
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.600
one of the academic books Pastor. Did you know that your staff studies

107
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.500
academic work?

108
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.600
but

109
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.300
So whoo, I got a whoo. I like

110
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.400
them. So he has a recently he

111
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.200
is so

112
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.300
well-documented in

113
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.200
his academic achievements currently. He is

114
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.300
a fellow in the public Theology of the

115
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.200
Kirby Lang Institute for Christian ethics. If you

116
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.700
don't know what that is, that's like an academic Collective Collective of

117
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.000
Mines that help represent help represent

118
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.900
us academically in the culture and

119
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.600
he's a participant in the Doles koloquium of

120
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.500
The Institute of Religion and public life. He's a

121
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.900
trustee at The Institute for religion and democracy. He

122
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.500
writes a personal blog that discusses politics and

123
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.700
public life and he includes topics like

124
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.500
marriage and family and work and Leisure and culture and

125
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.100
education and church and Mission.

126
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.200
And you can find his blog called Christianity for

127
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.300
the common good at Bruce ashford.net. And

128
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.400
so I wanted to I try

129
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.500
to find a statement that that characterizes his

130
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.500
heart and his mind and he writes on

131
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.300
his website. My conviction is that

132
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.000
that Jesus is Lord. And for that

133
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.200
reason we should be thoughtful and intentional about

134
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.500
how our belief in him should shape

135
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.500
our lives. And so I've been

136
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.000
worrying about this for a long time. I'm going to

137
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.400
say let's welcome Dr. Bruce Ashford and then he's gonna appear behind

138
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.700
us on the screen you believe that

139
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.400
You don't either.

140
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.600
My wife said yes, so ladies and

141
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.800
Gentlemen. Let's welcome to Henderson Hills Baptist Church via teleconferencing,

142
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800
Dr. Bruce Ashford.

143
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.000
No way. It'll work.

144
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.300
Fantastic. Well, listen, we would we

145
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.200
need to get to know you better Dr. Ashford. And so

146
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.200
tell us a little bit about yourself. Don't tell them. This is

147
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.600
the first time we've actually met faced to screen. But

148
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.700
anyway, tell us about yourself and and

149
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.300
tell us how you believe God has prepared you

150
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.300
to address the subject of religious freedom today.

151
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.100
Thank you so much for allowing me

152
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.800
to be yes. So about myself

153
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.100
of North Carolina. I hope that's not

154
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.000
enough against it.

155
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.800
Just during basketball season.

156
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.500
Yeah, just

157
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.500
Yeah, and don't listen

158
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.500
and attended

159
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.000
to go into politics or law.

160
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.200
Or quoting the ministry and I ended up service missionary

161
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.700
for two years instead of Malaysia with

162
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.100
Russia.

163
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.400
situation corner of Russia that was predominantly

164
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.700
Muslim

165
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.600
and and came back to the States

166
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.400
was ahead of the vicious Department of Southeast

167
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.900
Seminary about almost six right years.

168
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.000
And then ended up teaching this one

169
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.200
called.

170
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.200
He's turned in public theology is really the interface

171
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.600
of Christian Paul with public law.

172
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.400
The kind of things we deal with local realm

173
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.400
and so that's been my heartbeat.

174
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.500
on the matter religious liberty

175
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.500
I was born in 1974. Maybe there

176
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.700
are those of you who are at least my age who are

177
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.700
watching right now are a little bit older.

178
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.000
and I grew up during the during the Cold War and

179
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.600
you know, my parents received this newsletter in

180
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.800
the mail four times a year called The Prisoner bulletin and

181
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.400
it was stories from the front line and the Soviet Union. It

182
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.300
was about pastors and Christians who had been putting concentration

183
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.000
camps being tortured. Sometimes

184
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.500
kill the sake of the Gospel.

185
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.300
In other words, there was no religious liberty in the Soviet Union

186
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.000
and we would pray for them.

187
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.300
And if you had told me then

188
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.800
35 40 years ago

189
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.000
here in the United States

190
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.200
We would have a large number of people.

191
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.900
Who don't care about religious liberty?

192
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.300
And then an equally large number of people who are dead set against it.

193
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.500
I wouldn't believe.

194
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.400
But that's the case today. I mean our political scene in

195
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.200
the United States is something like the combination of

196
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.200
football game a carnival and a Hollywood movie, but

197
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.400
it's crazy.

198
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.600
And one of the most contested issues is religious

199
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.200
liberty and I'm very grateful that you asked me

200
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.800
to come and talk about it a little bit. It's subject which I'm which

201
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800
I'm very passionate and I think that is very important.

202
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.700
Real quick, Dr. Ashford. Tell us a little bit about your

203
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.900
role at Southeastern when you were there.

204
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.400
People here may not know what southeastern is. So tell us

205
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:09.800
what that is.

206
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.500
Yeah, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary

207
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.200
It's one of the world's largest seminaries and about

208
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.900
5,000 students wonderful list institution. That's always

209
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.300
Theology and Theology and velocity there

210
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.500
and serve as the Director of

211
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.300
commission Center for a while and then the college and then

212
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.500
he backley and then about two and a half years ago.

213
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.400
I moved to become a

214
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.100
fellow in public theology every language University.

215
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.700
Also, tell us a little bit about your time in cancer, Russia

216
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.500
and what you learned about religious liberty while

217
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:46.900
you were there.

218
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.400
Yes, I lived in the Republic of Patrick Star Russia

219
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.600
has republics the

220
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.800
United States has stage Russian has Republicans. So Republican

221
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.900
similar to say I lived in the Republican Pakistan

222
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.800
one of two Muslim republics in Russia. They used

223
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.500
to be three till she broke away.

224
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.200
And so when I moved there it was on it was

225
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200
a political hotspot people thought that Tucker slam

226
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.400
was going to try to pull away from Russia the

227
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.300
way chechnya had

228
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.800
It's about 50% Muslim

229
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.200
maybe 25% atheists and

230
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.800
25% of historic about his Christian.

231
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.100
And there still wasn't religious liberty even after the fall

232
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.100
of the Soviet Union. It was against the law for me to share the

233
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.900
gospel. And so when I was there I was harassed.

234
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.000
And there was kind of an air suspicion about me because I was

235
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.100
known as a religious guy.

236
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.500
And it's a wonderful learning experience for me.

237
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.900
I mean, it was freezing.

238
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.000
40 below zero comes in the winner

239
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.500
You can take a couple of Hot Coffee Starbucks coffee.

240
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.600
Pour it off of a third floor balcony and nothing

241
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.100
would hit the ground but ice chips involving grounds. Mmm those

242
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.300
cold. It was

243
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.900
costly different like to go to

244
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.600
The Banya which is a kind of a sauna and with each

245
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.200
other with Birch branches. Oh God.

246
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.400
And the delicious food there, but more than anything else everyone I

247
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.300
shared the gospel with.

248
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.600
And almost zero awareness

249
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.800
the gospel or any of the scrapbooks.

250
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.100
Because religious liberty had been so shuttled.

251
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.600
And the church had been so persecuted and imprisoned.

252
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.400
There's basically no gospel witness left.

253
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.400
And there are nation that we work hard to make

254
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.400
sure that that's not the case. We're not anywhere close to being

255
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.900
and that's your situation right now, but we

256
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.300
are headed in a bad Direction which many

257
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.400
people would like to shut a religious liberty.

258
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.200
So in an email exchange we discussed very

259
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.900
briefly the document called peaceful

260
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.300
coexistence and my research

261
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.600
says that it may have started as a

262
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.700
Marxist document, but but recently has been at

263
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.800
kind of adopted by our own government and explain

264
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.500
to us about this document peaceful coexistence and how

265
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.700
it stands in opposition to our constitution.

266
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.200
Yeah, so I'll just say if there are any of you there an audience

267
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.300
who have low blood pressure. I recommend reading this

268
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.700
essay completely blood pressure fix it

269
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.400
right just talking was published

270
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.900
I think and I don't know 2016 15 16 some

271
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.300
time along there. It was published funding United

272
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.700
States Commission on civil rights.

273
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.000
And you would think that United States Commission on civil rights?

274
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.100
Would be happy about religious liberty.

275
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.500
As a right. It's a Tron in the First Amendment to our constitution.

276
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.200
but instead

277
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.300
a majority of the people in the United States Commission on

278
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.300
civil rights argued in this paper that we should

279
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.300
Elevate non-discrimination laws above

280
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.500
religious liberty basically sexual preference

281
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.400
and gender identity non-discrimination

282
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.000
law above religious liberty.

283
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.000
So that the people speak out of their religious convictions?

284
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.600
In a matter that offends the transgender agenda.

285
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.100
Or the lgbtqia plus

286
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.700
agenda.

287
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.700
Then religious liberty loses non-discrimination went

288
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.200
wins. So you can find this document on

289
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.300
the internet our recommend you take a look at it read it

290
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.300
and you're gonna get a picture of what we're dealing with here

291
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.700
at the US. So it prioritize not discrimination laws about

292
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.000
religious liberty. The second thing it does.

293
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.900
It is salts religious Believers. All right, the chairman

294
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.300
of the United States Commission on civil rights. The

295
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.800
name is Martin Castro Vegas bidding last name. So

296
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.500
what he said something very similar to what Adel Castro

297
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.700
would say, here's what he said.

298
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.000
It's in the phrases religious liberty.

299
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.400
and religious freedom

300
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.100
will stand for nothing except as hypocrisy.

301
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.200
So long as they remain codewords for discrimination intolerance.

302
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.300
racism sexism

303
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.100
homophobia

304
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.200
islamophobia

305
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.400
Christian Supremacy or any other form of

306
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.100
entire lives

307
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.300
So the president of the United States Commission on civil

308
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.500
rights, Spartan Castro?

309
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.700
Believes in religious liberty is a code word.

310
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.700
for hypocrisy

311
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.700
bigotry and hatred

312
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.500
and so it smears and insults religious Believers

313
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.700
second thing that it does.

314
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.200
Third thing who doesn't misunderstands religion and

315
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.600
this is a very important point.

316
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.400
There are a lot of people in the United States many on

317
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.200
the left and some on the right. For example Wall Street,

318
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.500
right?

319
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.500
Who really don't give a flip about religion

320
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.200
they don't think it seriously.

321
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.500
and that if you religion the way we would you

322
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.200
a code or some

323
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.900
form of outer

324
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.100
something that people like to put on and dress up with

325
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.400
but they can easily take it off and there will be any consequences.

326
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.300
And that's what they want us to do. They want us to put our religious clothing on

327
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.000
when we go to church.

328
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.100
Or when we're at home.

329
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.600
But we're going to the Public Square and we talk about public issues.

330
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.100
You better take that note off believe it at the

331
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.100
door.

332
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.800
That's your view of religion religion is a superficial add-on

333
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.300
to life.

334
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.800
And a negative superficial add-on at that.

335
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.100
So what they want to do is they want to privatize religion.

336
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.200
And this brings up another document you'll hope it's okay. If

337
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.400
I bring up one more thing the Uber Excel

338
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.300
May Hodges same-sex marriage ruling.

339
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.700
And in that ruling the descending opinions

340
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.100
justices Roberts Thomas Toledo warned.

341
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.500
That that really had serious repercussions for

342
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.700
the person Amendment right to freedom

343
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.400
to create exercise of religion. Let me read you

344
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.900
a couple of things are pretty important justices said 50 cents

345
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.200
any opinions Chief Justice John Robinson.

346
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.900
the majority in this opinion

347
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.000
graciously Bank stations here graciously suggest

348
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.700
that religious Believers may continue to advocate.

349
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.600
and teach

350
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.900
their views of Mayor

351
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.400
the first amendment power

352
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.600
unlike them guarantees the freedom to

353
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.800
exercise religion.

354
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200
The point he's making here.

355
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.500
Is the Supreme Court majority of that time?

356
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.500
Just like the United States mission on civil rights wants to

357
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.800
privatize religion.

358
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.500
And want, you know, we can wear your religious floating if

359
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.300
you want to at church and at home

360
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.700
in private my spaces.

361
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.100
But you better take that stuff off and leave it when you come to

362
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.600
Public Square.

363
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.600
And then just Robert says yes, unfortunately people of faith

364
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.600
can take no comfort in the treatment they received from

365
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.700
the majority today.

366
00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.700
I also want to read something that Justice deleted

367
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.400
said that's the similarly to.

368
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.200
He said I assume that those who cling to Old beliefs.

369
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.300
Will be able to whisper their thoughts.

370
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.200
in the recesses of their homes

371
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.500
but if they repeat those views in public

372
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.000
They will risk being labeled as bigots.

373
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.300
and treated as such

374
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.000
by governments

375
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.200
employers and schools

376
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.700
by imposing its own view on the entire country majority facilitates

377
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.900
from marginalization of the

378
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.200
many Americans that additional ideas.

379
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.800
So this I mean these two documents there's so

380
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.200
much more evidence out there. I mean you've got Google

381
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.700
You watch the news. You understand that that's what we

382
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:09.900
deal with.

383
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.400
We're not just illness problem with with sometimes with

384
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.400
springboard. We're not just dealing with the problem in

385
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.400
the United States fish on civil rights. We're dealing with

386
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.500
major corporations in the United States who are

387
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.400
weaponized against Christian faith.

388
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.400
And I can tell you this we can't count on Wall Street

389
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.200
Wall Street left and many times the Wall

390
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.600
Street, right?

391
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.500
To have our concerns in mind.

392
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.100
When they pour money and whoever it

393
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.800
is, they want to be put on the ballot.

394
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.400
So Dr. Ashford, what

395
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.300
would you say in juxtaposition to this peaceful

396
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.300
coexistence document explained to

397
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.200
us briefly and concisely if

398
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.400
you will, what is the first amendment and why is

399
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.100
it so important for for the United

400
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.400
States?

401
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.600
Yes, because the First Amendment to the United States Constitution speaks to

402
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.900
a number of Rights including religious liberty.

403
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.600
Let me read.

404
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.100
Word for word here. It says Congress shall make no law.

405
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.900
respecting an establishment of religion

406
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.400
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

407
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.200
And this is very well put.

408
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.100
Book it says on the one hand.

409
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.300
Religion shouldn't be Force top down on anybody.

410
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.500
Congress shouldn't make a law.

411
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.600
Instituting Christianity is the official religion of the land in

412
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.100
order to be assisted in the United States. You have to be a

413
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.600
member of a Christian church or anything like that.

414
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.800
another hand

415
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.500
religion shouldn't be restricted top down.

416
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.300
So it shouldn't be Force Tottenham should be

417
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.300
forced to worship top down.

418
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.300
not should we be forced not to worship and not to exercise

419
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.100
our religion and

420
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.300
Now this free exercise of religion is extremely irritating

421
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.500
to a lot of our fellow citizens.

422
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.700
They would be fine with religious liberty.

423
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.200
If it was just that we had the right to teach what we

424
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.600
want to teach in our churches in our children at home.

425
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.000
That many of them will be okay with that.

426
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.400
What they are not okay with it's the free exercise

427
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.000
of religion.

428
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.600
Because listen to the Bible teaches when the Bible talks about religion.

429
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.700
It uses the word heart.

430
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.400
But we use the word heart over 800 times

431
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.800
to refer to religion.

432
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.300
And the Bible talks about the heart. Of course, it's not talking about the

433
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.400
party of vascular unit of pumps blood through

434
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.900
our body. It's referring to the Deep deepest interboast

435
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.900
recesses of the cell the central

436
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.600
organizer Community excesses.

437
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.600
And the Bible teaches that every human being is religious.

438
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.500
All of us in worshipers. We are the

439
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.500
worst of the god of Jesus Christ.

440
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.400
Or Allah Muhammad.

441
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.400
Or we were success or money or power.

442
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.900
The Bible's point is this that every human being absolutes is

443
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.400
something in life. We ascribe ultimately to

444
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:14.800
sign.

445
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.200
Sex for money or power for Jesus or whatever it is.

446
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.300
And whatever we prescribe ultimately to whatever is

447
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.500
number one for us functions that our God.

448
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.200
So someone could either worship the god of Jesus Christ so they can

449
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.600
work with counterfeit God. What are the other but everybody worships?

450
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.600
and the Bible also says that that

451
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.000
the issues of life flow from the heart

452
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.600
what that means is that once the human being has made

453
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.200
a decision to absolutize something in their life.

454
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.300
Once it holds the number one position sits on

455
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.100
the throne of the heart.

456
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.200
It absolutely will affect.

457
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.300
The way we act when we speak.

458
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.700
our dispositions and our attitudes

459
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.600
and so our Christianity should naturally

460
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.300
overflow into the

461
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:05.900
rest of our life.

462
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.200
And so if we don't have free exercise of religion.

463
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.500
We don't have freedom of religion at all.

464
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.800
So you would say that the US

465
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.600
Constitution stands in perfect opposition

466
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.700
to the peaceful coexistence Doctrine coming

467
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.000
from the Civil Rights chair. What

468
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.300
do you what would you say the

469
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.900
Christian faith has to say about religious

470
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.400
liberty.

471
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.500
Yeah, you know, I'll start by saying I think the Christian faith

472
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.800
teaches something that God's ideal.

473
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.700
Is something very much like what we see in the First Amendment

474
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.800
to the United States Constitution that people should and

475
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.300
we people should be free to align their lives

476
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.100
of their conditions and to do so freely.

477
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.900
openly and without fear

478
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.200
so if we were to go through different teachings in the Bible.

479
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.300
Excuse me. I'm of an advanced age now in the

480
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.400
minority since I've got to put my reading glasses on. Thank you.

481
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.500
Look good in those sir. I've been nervous Panic every

482
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.500
time I get ready to stand up and teach. So

483
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.100
I forgot my reading glasses. I'm gonna mess.

484
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.300
So the first thing we've mentioned is that in the Bible. No, we're

485
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.300
we see God coercing religion.

486
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.600
It doesn't he doesn't.

487
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.900
Doesn't want to coerce us.

488
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.200
And so first first thing first thing about the second

489
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.800
is that God created us and His Image and likeness.

490
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.800
And part of being created in His image and likeness is

491
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.600
that we have freedoms to choose.

492
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.300
and to act

493
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.100
and to create and to think I mean a great freedom to

494
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.200
fashion alive

495
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.900
in a way that we choose as long as it does to bring harm to other people.

496
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.300
And and so this is has been known about the

497
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.100
circles as freedom of conscience. And that's a good way to put it God's given

498
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.200
us freedom of conscience.

499
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.400
The third thing to note is that the Bible teaches

500
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.200
us of the Gospel is freely given and freely receive.

501
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.100
Amidst the nature of the Gospel right that God freely sent

502
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.600
his son.

503
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.500
First Corinthians, you know Paul says to the Corinthians,

504
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.500
you know, or wherever you want to whatever statement in

505
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.500
the Bible want to go through First

506
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.200
Corinthians. 1535 is a good one.

507
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.700
That God freely gave his son.

508
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.600
to die behalf of our sins

509
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.600
to be buried

510
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.000
and to rise from the dead.

511
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.700
To set us free from the consequences of our sins and his resurrection

512
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.400
from the dead is also down women and he's going

513
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.300
to return one day to set the world to rise.

514
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.800
This gospel was freely given by God and and we

515
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.100
freely receive it. We can accept it or we

516
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.900
can reject that's the nature of True Religion.

517
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.200
And so we don't want to set up a situation in the United States

518
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.800
legally.

519
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.300
You know that that goes against that.

520
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.200
the last thing that I would imagine

521
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.000
Is this look?

522
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.800
Nobody can actually take away.

523
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.800
Our religious liberty completely.

524
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.700
the Christians and the Soviet Union

525
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.600
Who were born from their homes?

526
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.700
put in concentration camps

527
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.400
Where they died after six or nine months or a

528
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:36.400
year?

529
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.800
Sometimes killed by Iron squads.

530
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.300
the Christians in different areas of North Africa in

531
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.600
the Middle East to experience severe persecution

532
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200
the early Christians

533
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.400
and church history

534
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.900
the anabaptists our corvairs

535
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.700
balances argue buyers an example. He's a young Theologian

536
00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.500
is I think he's in his early 30s when he's burned

537
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.100
alive at the state.

538
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.800
and poor gunpowder induced beer

539
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.600
when I'm on fire and burn it from the base down.

540
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.300
These men and women didn't have their religious liberty taken

541
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:13.600
away.

542
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.300
They were still free to exercise their religion. They just

543
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.500
had to be ready to accept the consequences.

544
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.800
And so I think one of the things that we learned from church

545
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.200
history and from our brothers and sisters around the world.

546
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.500
Is that if we do find ourselves in a situation where our

547
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.600
religious liberty is restricted in some way or punished, but

548
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.100
it that way.

549
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.300
Then God's call upon us as to exercise our religion

550
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.400
and be willing to face the consequences.

551
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.700
That's a top feel for America's swallow.

552
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.400
Because we've always come from a position of strength where

553
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.100
we had freedom.

554
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.800
And we're slowly beginning to lose that freedom of waste.

555
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.500
So if it if it appears as

556
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.600
that, the societal trend is turning

557
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.800
away from religious liberty. What how did

558
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.200
that happen? What what did we do to allow

559
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.000
that to happen? And what can we do to

560
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.900
kind of stem that tide? Is there anything?

561
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.900
Is the big question you throw fastballs, you know that we get

562
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.200
you one night so stand at the

563
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.100
plate and take your medicine.

564
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.100
So there's geometry is

565
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.600
that way out of 7 or 2008

566
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.700
it was a brilliant.

567
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.100
eccentric genius

568
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.100
it was hired or fully tenured faculty member

569
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.000
at 23 years old at University, Pennsylvania.

570
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.300
Most college students today are a year number seven

571
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.600
of college when they're 24 and haven't

572
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.200
quite radicated yet. This guy was and he started

573
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.200
out on the left. He was a darling of the left. He was

574
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.600
on all the big talk shows and the you know, the yes the

575
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.100
60s and 70s.

576
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.300
And then he disappeared for about 25 years.

577
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.300
went underground

578
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.100
any resurfaced toward the end of his life

579
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.000
at the turn of the century.

580
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.200
And published a Trilogy called The Sacred order

581
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.500
social order trilogy.

582
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.800
And he had become quite conservative in the meantime.

583
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.200
And in this book when he argues is he already said the

584
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.800
United States or the West in general but especially

585
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.200
the United States has been in the middle of it historically unprecedented

586
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.200
at its campus severed or from

587
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.000
social worker now, that's that's fancy language.

588
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.200
Scholars people and Academia

589
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.200
feel like they have to make up words and phrases right makes it important

590
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.800
and

591
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.000
And said, he was important obviously.

592
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.800
But that what he means by safer to order is a

593
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.100
religious and moral ordering.

594
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.500
That every society every civilization history has

595
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.700
had some sort of religious moral ordering.

596
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.300
And he said that the cultural Elite in the United States

597
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.400
I wanted to sever.

598
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.100
Social order which is our cultural institutions

599
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.200
in our society.

600
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.000
to separate

601
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.900
from our religious moral ordering so that society and

602
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.500
culture float on their own now being rooted

603
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.000
in the day of Christian role.

604
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.600
and

605
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.100
we found this offensive and he found it greatly destructive.

606
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.700
to our culture

607
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.300
He called our cultural lead

608
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.000
to officer class.

609
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.300
Because I like to order a surround.

610
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.800
Because I think they know best.

611
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.900
And they think that society would be better off without.

612
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.500
What brings is that? They've been quite successful.

613
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.000
but that there's hope

614
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.900
and when he says that there's hope we should listen to it.

615
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.500
Because he taught one of the most liberal institutions in

616
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.100
the United States of America and all of his friends are people to

617
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.000
the far far left.

618
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.500
Who don't care about religious liberty or are opposed

619
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:10.500
to?

620
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.300
And he said that there's hope of pause has already

621
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.400
cracks in the foundation. He said that they're

622
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.800
already is a bit of a panic.

623
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.700
among opponents of the Christian faith

624
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.800
because they're beginning to taste the consequences of the

625
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.000
red rejection of the basic moral order

626
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.100
of articulated by Judaism and Christianity.

627
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.000
And he ends his book.

628
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.600
Um first book is called my life

629
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.100
among the death.

630
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.200
And death works by the way, what he argues is.

631
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.200
Is it in a culture where we have gotten rid of did you know

632
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:47.900
Christian world you?

633
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.900
That the cultural products the things we produce the

634
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.900
music and the movies and the artwork

635
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.600
and Etc. He said they become death. Wor.

636
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.300
Ries and instead of breathing life into society they bring

637
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.100
that okay.

638
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.100
and at the end of this book

639
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.900
He said that the world awaits of people.

640
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.800
And I'm gonna name that.

641
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.100
the Christian church

642
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.200
and specifically Anderson Hills

643
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.500
tonight

644
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.900
the world awaits of people who can recover the Friday beauty

645
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.800
of the Thou shalt and the Thou shalt not

646
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.900
think about that for a moment.

647
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.100
Say that out and now shall not he has gonna say

648
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.300
say that again and elaborate for us make

649
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:33.900
us understand that.

650
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.200
Yes, and the thriving beauty of the Thou shalt and

651
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.100
the Thou shalt not.

652
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.300
So Thou shalt enough shalt not the first of the moral

653
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.300
order what we should things that we should do and things that we shouldn't do

654
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.200
and God has played those out for us in Scripture.

655
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.300
And reset there's a frightening Beauty to it.

656
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.600
It's beautiful because when Society lives by

657
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.900
these rules, there's order.

658
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.400
And the katana have awarded that causes human beings to

659
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:01.700
flourish.

660
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.600
But it's also product.

661
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.700
for people who want to be their own God

662
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.800
because it reminds them.

663
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.000
That they're not Young.

664
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.600
And so recent is that the world awaits of

665
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.100
people and our challenge not I think the challenge that

666
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:20.700
God gives us.

667
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.400
Is for us to take ownership of that that we are.

668
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.200
and so reef reef is the first intellectual I want

669
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:30.900
I want to point to

670
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.200
the second intellectual

671
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.600
he sees there are some little lectures for Good Guys.

672
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.600
And who teach at some of the big universities they're the second

673
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.700
electron, which is many Charles Taylor.

674
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.300
Now, it's not the same God with Chuck Taylor tennis shoes. All

675
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.100
right. Thank you.

676
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.700
different guy

677
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.600
and Charles Taylor wrote an enormous

678
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.300
book. I mean, he's huge. It's size of a cinder block. It's called

679
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.600
a secular age. I don't recommend that you read it. If you

680
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.600
do buy and try to read it, I'd definitely I recommend

681
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.400
that you're not reading at night when you're getting ready to go to bed because

682
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.200
I'm afraid to tell it, you know start reading

683
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.400
it. You'll fall asleep that sense get depression. Yeah.

684
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.500
and I'm ready for you and

685
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.700
I'll kind of describe what he says system and at the

686
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.400
beginning, you know, a lot of the book he's saying something similar to

687
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:22.800
read.

688
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.500
And then it and add something to it. But but it

689
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.200
says, you know Christianity has been displaced from

690
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.200
the default position.

691
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.100
So when he says that we live in a secular age. He doesn't mean

692
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.400
we live in an age for their hardly any religious believers.

693
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.900
That's not true.

694
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.200
But he says we live in a secular age doesn't mean that

695
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.700
most people.

696
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:47.500
It's not true.

697
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.300
What he means is that.

698
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.000
Christianity has been displaced from the default position.

699
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.500
And now it's just one among does

700
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.200
so philosophies will use an ideology.

701
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.300
And it will still lasting.

702
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.200
Years, they aren't using he also gives a really good

703
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.200
view into the mindset of secular progressives.

704
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.100
He says listen.

705
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.400
Secular progressives who?

706
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.600
Want to undermine the Christian thing?

707
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.100
And overthrow it.

708
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.500
That's very confident what they believe.

709
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.200
This is a matter of fact their fragilized. So

710
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.200
you made a horror. I told you like to

711
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:32.600
make work.

712
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.300
Fragilize it'd be important. Let's get

713
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.200
their own work. But so he says

714
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:39.400
that

715
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.100
people in a secular west across pressure and fragilized

716
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.400
All right. Let's take each of those words.

717
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.100
One at a time.

718
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.900
cross pressure

719
00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.500
What are you saying is we have cross-pressions. We've

720
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.200
got a pressure coming from one side and pressure coming from

721
00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:58.900
Another Side.

722
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.300
From one side we have this social pressure.

723
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800
to capitulate

724
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.300
the disown the Christian faith to get rid of the Christian

725
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.600
teaching on gender and sexuality specific.

726
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.300
Most of the hot and buff issues to

727
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.000
American politics have been together.

728
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.200
That just that's a fact.

729
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.400
So there's a pressure get rid of Christianity.

730
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.400
So we can do and say what we want with regarded gender

731
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.700
insects and other things.

732
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.600
This is pressure not to believe that bigoted hateful

733
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.400
ignorant stuff.

734
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.300
But there's a cross pressure Taylor status.

735
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.200
But if you read your Bible.

736
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.500
and if you pay attention to the world around

737
00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.300
you'll know that God instructed the

738
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.500
world at such a way that it testifies existence.

739
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.200
The Taylor points that out.

740
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.600
He calls it signals at transcendent.

741
00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.900
That's another phrase that was made up by differences

742
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.200
the element. It's also important.

743
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.800
obviously

744
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.200
a signals of transcendence that there are things all around

745
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.400
us like a sunset.

746
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.800
of the sunrise

747
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.300
or I mean you name it

748
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.400
the massive beauty of this world. It's ordering its

749
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.000
regularity.

750
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.100
The law cause and effective do bad things

751
00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.400
that is going to happen in return when you do good things good

752
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.500
things tend to happen return.

753
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.100
all of these features of the universe being in the existence of

754
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.700
a god

755
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.300
and Taylor says that many of the people who seemed so

756
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.600
firmly opposed and adamantly opposed the Christian faith

757
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.800
are actually quite fragile fragilized.

758
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.900
by this cross pressure

759
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.600
and so refunds Taylor both give us some encouragement.

760
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.500
Reef said

761
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.100
the world awaits of people

762
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.400
and that's God's people. That's true.

763
00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.300
and Taylor says

764
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.300
the people we'd like to fix

765
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.400
there may be a lot of Bluster.

766
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.200
and a lot of vitriol

767
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.400
But deep down meaning in fragile in

768
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.500
their beliefs. The last thing Taylor says

769
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.100
is something I find fasting.

770
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.600
Makes up another praise.

771
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.200
He says that the United States is characterized by

772
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.900
an extraordinary moral inarticulous.

773
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.200
And here's how explains it.

774
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.900
Says on the one hand.

775
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.600
People in the United States have seen incredible.

776
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.400
ideals

777
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.900
We're going to abolish poverty program.

778
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.200
So that there's equal income for everyone on the globe.

779
00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.400
you know, we're gonna get rid of it justice, we're gonna

780
00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.900
usher in you know, we're gonna have political revolutions

781
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.200
that

782
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.500
give us kind of a Utopia episode. So we

783
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.400
have these really high deals. Yes.

784
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.500
but the Army is

785
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.000
we have nothing to fund those ideals. We have

786
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.600
no way of we have nothing to point where ideas

787
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.200
come from except around. Yes.

788
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.200
We've got rid of the idea that there's a God the hundred bird

789
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:22.800
age like this.

790
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.900
Who would act and make it happen?

791
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.900
We've gotten rid. I mean listen.

792
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.000
If there's a moral law.

793
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.300
There has to be a law given.

794
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.600
But they insist that there's no law Giver.

795
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.400
So now that could be no more alone.

796
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.700
All there is more opinion.

797
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.600
And so what Taylor points out is that we live in this country was

798
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.100
for me love decided. There's no longer.

799
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.200
And now they're realizing that means there's no more a law.

800
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.200
All there is a plural opinions.

801
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.300
And when all there is is only thing that's

802
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.700
left to do is to shout each other down.

803
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.300
Which is a pretty good description probably if you're basically electrons,

804
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.200
you know.

805
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.400
I mean, that's what happens when you get you know, that email from Uncle Earl.

806
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.500
It's like in all half expectations. Just want

807
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.300
to see local girls all caps lock it is

808
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.200
exclamation mark he disabled it would be able to send an email

809
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.500
and

810
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.500
Were just business look we're in a tough spot that we've got brief,

811
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.200
and we've got Taylor.

812
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.200
Now the third intellectual.

813
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.800
Is a didn't even tell local christian.

814
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.800
Very similar to us maybe throw

815
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.200
through.

816
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.100
And he's written on a concept called expressive individualism.

817
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.500
and this isn't unique to him and he's written the

818
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.800
the world Authority book

819
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.100
and I'm sure he's made up some words to that. I just don't

820
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.500
remember as our season.

821
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.400
but expressive individualism says this

822
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.300
and when he's arguing is a secular

823
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:08.600
age.

824
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.900
In our secular age America expresses individualism has

825
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.400
become the functional religion for many or

826
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.100
most Americans.

827
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.100
including many Americans Republic Christians

828
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.400
expressive individualism

829
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.200
The point of life is feel and take.

830
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.200
and the way to be authentic

831
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.800
is to follow the desires of my heart.

832
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.800
That's how you you're authenticated.

833
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.000
and the way to be an authentic Society

834
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.100
is to applaud other people for following

835
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.300
the desires of their heart.

836
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.200
Now do you see the problem with that?

837
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.900
The problem is it besides our hearts are all completely.

838
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.200
Wrong and one way area.

839
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.600
And so that's what we've got. Our own Nation right now is we've

840
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.000
got a nation full of people who want to

841
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.100
fulfill their own desires. A lot of that is sexually

842
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.200
but there's other things too a lot

843
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:11.600
of its sexual.

844
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.700
And want Society go all them for doing it.

845
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.500
So this is the sort of situation Brandon. Yes,

846
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.700
I mean Bill your fastball group.

847
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.400
I've swung three times now actually the three

848
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.300
that's one with Taylor as long with Truman.

849
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.100
I hope they hit ball with one of them. All right, if I didn't

850
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.200
free trucks in your app. This is how we

851
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:37.900
go we are

852
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.700
This is why we can't have nice things.

853
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.300
So let's all in all of our toys

854
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.100
while we're

855
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.200
in a rough spot here in the

856
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.600
US and one more thing here.

857
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.000
I'm sorry Bill. He's here Professor. I thought

858
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.400
um, I'm not important that that's made up

859
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:03.700
anymore.

860
00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:08.700
Here's the deal.

861
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.300
This change has been in the way for a long time. We can say

862
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.500
at least since the 60s.

863
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.500
Those of you have a certain age some of you were alive 60s you

864
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:18.900
saw it happen.

865
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.800
So we've got more than happy century.

866
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.700
of secularization

867
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.800
This is not going to be changed in the next election.

868
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:31.600
Now I know that.

869
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.700
People news show in America will tell you.

870
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.600
Every single presidential election cycle that this

871
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.200
is the most important presidential election cycle ever

872
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.400
in America history.

873
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.700
and I don't need to minimize presidential election Cycles,

874
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:49.800
but

875
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.500
there's no presidential elections. I'm going to face the

876
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.100
best brainer.

877
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.000
Can move the needle on a better correct? Sure, we're

878
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.600
gonna have to play the ball game.

879
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.400
We're gonna have to bear plate with this and do

880
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.700
the hard work right balls change.

881
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.600
for decades on it

882
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.400
That's what we're going to have to.

883
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:13.200
so

884
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.700
you mentioned that that the secular

885
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.500
religious social I mean the sexual

886
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.600
or social order sees cracks in the

887
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.300
foundation.

888
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.900
And you've also said that we can

889
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.800
stem the tide by playing the long game and

890
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.700
being the voice that God's called

891
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.100
us to be what does that

892
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.600
look like practically for a none of

893
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.500
us here are in a religious think

894
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:49.100
tank or professors at the Seminary but but

895
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.200
we do want to make a difference. And so what does that look

896
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.400
like? How can we make a difference?

897
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.600
playing the long game

898
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.100
Yes, so let me out the phrase to that. We need to

899
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.700
take the broad view and we need to play the long game.

900
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.700
So let's start with taking Broadview.

901
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.300
Thank you the wrong humase. And I think this is

902
00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.100
going to be encouraging.

903
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:14.200
For for those of you who are out there and video lands

904
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.600
right now for kids video and we're there

905
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.100
and there's still that.

906
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.000
All of the things God has given you to do in life.

907
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.700
all of them matter to him

908
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.100
each of those things

909
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.000
God calls every Christian to a family

910
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.000
a church

911
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:34.900
workplace

912
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.700
And a community right? So we're a family member a church

913
00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:40.000
member.

914
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.600
a worker

915
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.100
your work could be at home or be out of

916
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.400
the home. Either way. It's workplace.

917
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.400
And then called you be a citizen and community and the way you

918
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.400
fulfill those callings the way we fulfill those callings.

919
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.800
Does impact our society?

920
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.600
not just

921
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.700
an impacts Society on the national level

922
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.300
we can get

923
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.300
I was uncommon as the Fox News for four years you

924
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.200
would think that would be able not really I mean

925
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.200
news influence well enough, but I'm not able I mean even when

926
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:15.600
I had

927
00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.300
You know some positions like that you would think would have

928
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.600
some influence of what we have that much influence. None of

929
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.300
us do but we do have influence of the local

930
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.600
level in the state level.

931
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.500
So when we exercise our colleagues

932
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.300
When we take when when we're faithful in our

933
00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.000
workplace, for example, you might work in art Sciences

934
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.800
or scholarship and education politics and

935
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.200
economics Business and Entrepreneurship.

936
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.200
agriculture

937
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.600
Entertainment, it is sports. I

938
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.000
mean you name it.

939
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.300
That's the place where we can exercise significant influence.

940
00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.300
By doing our work to God's glory and representing him. Well

941
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.300
so that when people see a Christian they respect that Christian.

942
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.100
That's one of the things we got to do is we've got

943
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:10.500
to live the sort of lives that are respected in the community the early

944
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.200
church. Did this in Rome?

945
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.200
And when they were persecute religious minority and

946
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.300
even Julius Stanford who hated

947
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.500
them had to say he said I forget the

948
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.500
exact quote at one point put out of public places. Like

949
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.900
I'm so tired of hearing.

950
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.300
That it's always the Christians to take care of the sick from the plane comes

951
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.300
through. I'm so tired of them setting up hospitals. I can

952
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.200
do what they do.

953
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.300
We're just as good as them are we?

954
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:41.000
In other words, he was jealous of the good things they did and what

955
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.400
God would like us to do.

956
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.500
Is to make other people jealous so to speak.

957
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.100
of the good lives with

958
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.100
so that they'll want that God.

959
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.600
So taking the broad view means that changing influencing

960
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.100
Society. Thank God.

961
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.900
It's not limited to the 2024 presidential election.

962
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.300
Which most Americans Christian are not as we think.

963
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.600
Being culture change comes from residential life.

964
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.300
But it's a significant moment. I'm not saying it's

965
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.300
not important experience.

966
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.000
But the things we do in an everyday basis.

967
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.700
All of those things are important.

968
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.800
slain elongate this means

969
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.400
We've got to be invisible Long Haul and the warning

970
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.100
that I know that I've always tried to give my students

971
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:33.500
is.

972
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.400
Don't sell your soul.

973
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.400
To get a short-term political think free of whatever sort it

974
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:41.400
is.

975
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.100
just

976
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.500
are influence

977
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.200
for Christ

978
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.500
Is something that stretches over the entirety of our lifetime?

979
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.100
I'm not over the next year or the next two and a

980
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.800
given presidential election site. So

981
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.600
let's not.

982
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.500
For example, behave better the election site.

983
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.400
And show ourselves and act out in a bad

984
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:10.700
ways.

985
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.500
Because we feel like I'm sure for some

986
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.300
reason that will be good but not the

987
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.500
meaning great people we disagree with assembly line

988
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.500
at Christian career after you hear the wall.

989
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.400
And then the other thing I would mention is.

990
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.400
Just encourage you all here. There are legal.

991
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.900
firms like Alliance, depending freedom

992
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.800
first celebrity in Texas

993
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.300
who are fighting in Arabic hat on matters of religious liberty

994
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.400
that is religious liberty freedom of speech other

995
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.600
rights that we've got. And so

996
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.800
there's legal reasons recourse against Martin Castro

997
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.600
is proud.

998
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.500
We also happy for us to civil disobedience.

999
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.200
If and when we are told we can't speak

1000
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.700
our mind on again issue.

1001
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.400
Even when we are told of not exercise our faith and

1002
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:12.800
given way.

1003
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:19.300
We do have the ability to dissipate engage

1004
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.300
in Civil Disobedience.

1005
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.400
I think we should say civil disability really

1006
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:24.700
matters.

1007
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.300
Or else we likely I'd love.

1008
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.900
But that's a recourse called future we need it.

1009
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.400
And then finally on the you know

1010
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.300
playing office of this. Yes, we can just take

1011
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.400
a page out of the Playbook of the person's future.

1012
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.400
the majority of restaurants historically

1013
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.700
outside of the medieval

1014
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.200
Christian West

1015
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.400
Morty majority of Christians historically a majority of Christians

1016
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.200
around the globe today lived in places where their religious

1017
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.500
Liberties is punished.

1018
00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.000
Their their punished severely besides their religion.

1019
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.700
We're kind of the exception.

1020
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.200
And so, you know if the news it's Ronald.

1021
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.100
if we received some punishments for acting

1022
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.900
on our beliefs

1023
00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:14.200
then

1024
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.300
God will walk with us through the fire.

1025
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.200
so

1026
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.600
let me ask you a couple of questions.

1027
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.400
Is it possible?

1028
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.300
I want to be careful when I say this and you

1029
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.500
may figure out why as I ask it. Is it possible to

1030
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.500
win a short-term political victory?

1031
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.100
and lose

1032
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.800
in the long game

1033
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.700
Can you give me an example?

1034
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:54.600
I don't have an example that I'm willing to give okay?

1035
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.300
would say

1036
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.000
one of the things

1037
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.700
the founding fathers

1038
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.100
never envisioned the United States in which there

1039
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.500
were two major political parties.

1040
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.300
heavenly

1041
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.500
That was not their vision.

1042
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.100
It might surprise you because it's the only thing you've known.

1043
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.700
But what happens when you have two major political parties?

1044
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.500
Isn't their invented each other.

1045
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.900
They depend on each other.

1046
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.000
There's only one person to demonize.

1047
00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.300
We could focus all of our efforts we can toss elections back

1048
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.300
and forth we each other.

1049
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.300
and whoever we

1050
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.900
Nominate, they're gonna have to look for him.

1051
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.300
and there's gonna come a time when we as, you know,

1052
00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.600
wouldn't even go Christians are going to have to say

1053
00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.200
to a given party

1054
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.400
We're not going to vote for whatever head you can do on

1055
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.300
hand to us on a planet.

1056
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.900
Probably I'll be my guest.

1057
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:14.900
another

1058
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.600
way that we can lose. I mean, I think we we feel under such

1059
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.000
fresh or to make our point and a short

1060
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.500
term, you know, short-term issue like that. Maybe it's an election or

1061
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.500
a contested issue that we're willing

1062
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.300
to behave badly hmm to speak

1063
00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.400
in ways or Unbecoming of the Christian faith.

1064
00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.400
To degrade other people we give

1065
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.800
ourselves a right to judge other people's bars.

1066
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.300
And the things that the Bible never gets us permission to

1067
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:43.300
do.

1068
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:45.500
um

1069
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.200
that answer is exactly what

1070
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.100
I was hoping to hear because I see out of

1071
00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.400
frustration and out of fear Christians responding in

1072
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.700
manners that are not very Christian.

1073
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.700
You know Jesus when he spoke.

1074
00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.000
He spoke some hard Cruise man, when he said some things yeah

1075
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.800
people like a bag of hammers. He didn't

1076
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.100
pull his punch this video great.

1077
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.700
You know when he spoke he spoke with this powerful combination of

1078
00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:17.000
Truth and Grace by truth. I

1079
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.700
mean that he spoke the truth about reality.

1080
00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.500
Didn't hold it back.

1081
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.600
and by grace

1082
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.300
I mean that he spoke it in such a way that he wasn't

1083
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.800
decimating the person.

1084
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.500
And condemning the person.

1085
00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:31.500
so

1086
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:33.700
like

1087
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.800
when we the political REM and we speak truth without Grace.

1088
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.900
or political bullies

1089
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.000
that doesn't honor God.

1090
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.000
like we speak truth about Grace is when we

1091
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.600
don't speak as somebody who

1092
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.900
get them for the grace of God should be condemned.

1093
00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.700
You know we speak in a different manner from a perch from a moral

1094
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.400
merge with condescension and and

1095
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.300
with a kind of a condemning wrath or other people.

1096
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.800
And that's political bullying and that we shouldn't be characterized

1097
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.100
by that.

1098
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.700
But then another had people speak when they

1099
00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.700
speak then got raised but not true.

1100
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.200
It's all graciousness.

1101
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:24.300
But they're gonna pull the punches and not tell the truth our praying

1102
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.900
to say the Bible says in a given issue.

1103
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.700
And their political went for non-energies.

1104
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.400
So we don't want to be political bullies.

1105
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.100
Jerks on the one hand. We don't want to be political Winston on

1106
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.000
the enemies on the other hand.

1107
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.900
We want to exhibit that Jesus that powerful

1108
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.100
Jesus like combination of Truth and Grace.

1109
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.100
amen

1110
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.100
So I want to ask one more question before we do that. I'd like to summarize some of the things

1111
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.800
that I've heard so that if I'm wrong you can you can

1112
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.700
You can correct me first and foremost. We have the privilege of

1113
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.200
voting. So we take the Holy Spirit into the

1114
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.500
voting booth with us. And then the secondly

1115
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:05.600
We Can Make a Difference by just praying

1116
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.500
and living out our faith where

1117
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.400
God has called us to live whether that's our home

1118
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.200
or our work or our church or neighborhood wherever

1119
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.600
God has called us to make a difference for him and number

1120
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.300
three we can we can

1121
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:23.300
support those who are illegal that

1122
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.400
support legal recourse like the

1123
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.600
alliance defending freedom.

1124
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.200
We don't have to worry yet about Civil Disobedience, but

1125
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.400
that's an option if we ever have to I'm not

1126
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.200
excited about that. But but I do trust that the

1127
00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:36.400
Lord.

1128
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.400
The Lord's plans will prevail and and he

1129
00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.500
has used Christians in much more difficult circumstances in

1130
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.000
a mighty way.

1131
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.400
And he will use us as well. So the last question I

1132
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.500
want to pull back a little bit from the political Arena and

1133
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.100
just talk about what does it mean to have to Be

1134
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:57.300
an Effective Christian witness in the secular age. How

1135
00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:01.400
can we how can we be that effective Christian Witnesses? Just

1136
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.400
is that our testimony? What does that

1137
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:03.400
look like?

1138
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:09.100
Yeah, you know I've listed four things here and they

1139
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.200
all start with an alarm.

1140
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.800
I haven't been at work. I'm not actually answer this

1141
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.300
question. So we mentioned four things we can

1142
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.800
do to give powerful witness from

1143
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.300
position of cultural weakness. In other

1144
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.800
words. We find our stuff for the minority. How can we still get powerful witness

1145
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.500
it first thing we need to do I would

1146
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.200
say is to resent her God.

1147
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.100
Or reintroduce God to the Public

1148
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:37.500
Square.

1149
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.000
God has already been introduced.

1150
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.000
To lots of Americans and he's been

1151
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.800
introduced to them by MSNBC.

1152
00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.200
and by CNN

1153
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.900
and my box and by

1154
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.900
Muslims of my Buddhists and by seculars, I mean

1155
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.200
they put lots of things about God.

1156
00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.100
But they probably actually haven't met the god

1157
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.000
that we know we've got to find some way to reintroduce

1158
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.400
him to the public imagination.

1159
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.400
So they're imagining God and thinking of him the

1160
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.300
way he actually is.

1161
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.100
Rather than dispute or distorted version. They might have to see

1162
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.700
so what are some ways we can do that recenter God.

1163
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.900
One of the things we can do is we can make sure that the

1164
00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.900
Bible's Narrative of the world.

1165
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.100
Is our Master Mary?

1166
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.200
That's where the world is what frames everything else for us

1167
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.000
that it's not the Fox News narrative famous MSNBC

1168
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.200
narrative or the CNN area.

1169
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:39.100
Now those people know what's funny. I have a

1170
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.700
favorite among those three. It's not MSNBC.

1171
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.200
But what I'm saying is the bottles Narrative of

1172
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.200
the world that is the master narrity and when

1173
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.500
any of our favorite people news networks or political funds

1174
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.500
or political parties or whatever Department in the Bible says the

1175
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:54.500
world

1176
00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:58.200
we stay within the Bible started the world and it's our

1177
00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.200
Master friend of reality.

1178
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.300
Um a second thing is that we got to find

1179
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:04.700
ways of

1180
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.800
articulating to people or showing people

1181
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.500
that our God

1182
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:15.100
is The One and Only God the true God and that

1183
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:18.200
when we the god of Jesus Christ is the

1184
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.800
only one who can follow through on his promise.

1185
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.400
That when you elevate sexual pleasure or

1186
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.200
financial gain or power.

1187
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.800
Or the approval of other people or any

1188
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.300
of these other things to the ultimate level

1189
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:33.900
in your life.

1190
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.800
And you put them on the throne.

1191
00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:40.400
those things can't promise to sell they they can't deliver on the

1192
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.000
salvation of

1193
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:46.200
and when we as a country corporately elevates

1194
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.700
says

1195
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.800
or money or power

1196
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.700
and we make it ultimate.

1197
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.300
Then he can't deliver for our country when it costs

1198
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.800
and instead hurts us to breaks us.

1199
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.800
So we've got to find a way that we can to reset

1200
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.600
for God put him back to the center and look

1201
01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.500
see really is.

1202
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.500
The second thing is equally important.

1203
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.700
If we have if we're going to reset for God we're going to have to decent

1204
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.200
for the self.

1205
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.200
And what does it mean to decenter the self it means that?

1206
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.400
How do you descent itself?

1207
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.200
One of the ways we decent for ourselves as Christians is so

1208
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.800
that God can take Center Stage instead

1209
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.400
of us taking Center Stage is is

1210
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.200
for Christians to be known as the people who seek the good of the

1211
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.500
whole city as it says in Jeremiah 29 chapter

1212
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.300
29 verse 57. God told me Israel

1213
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.100
to see the good of the city.

1214
01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.300
He says the same thing to his church today is to seek

1215
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.200
the good of our entire nation. So we don't want to be seen as

1216
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.800
kind of people who only webinarize politically to

1217
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.900
get rights for Christians.

1218
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.600
We want to be seen as the kind of people.

1219
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.600
Who want to push for a political agenda in our country that serves everybody

1220
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.000
well?

1221
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.900
For us to be the kind of people that genuine concern for the

1222
01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.700
economically disadvantage who had genuine concern or

1223
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.900
victims of crops.

1224
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.600
Or whatever the issues we think

1225
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.200
we want to be seen as good built. We want to

1226
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.200
be good will be.

1227
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.300
And seek the good of our whole extent.

1228
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.500
The second way to decenter the self is this

1229
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.700
combination of proof of Grace?

1230
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.600
if we can refuse to be political bullies and

1231
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:32.900
jurors

1232
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.500
Even when our political leaders are releasing jerks.

1233
01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.400
If we can speak with truth and Grace the

1234
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.300
way Jesus did.

1235
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.700
And followed Jesus instead of a favorite political leader.

1236
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.800
That's a way of decent bring the self. It's way

1237
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.100
engage in politics. It's not egocentric.

1238
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.300
narcissistic vitriolic

1239
01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:57.600
Etc

1240
01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.200
So there is a way to this doesn't mean to

1241
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.500
be a wimp in the Public Square. You can be strong. Jesus was strong.

1242
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.000
The strongest, you know, the strongest vendors ever lived.

1243
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.600
That we can speak through the power.

1244
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.300
And we can stick to our governments and we could not budge.

1245
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.300
and we can also do it our

1246
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.200
retaining a Christian

1247
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.600
so we want to receptor.

1248
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.900
on a decent of the cell

1249
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:36.100
Actually all about points just right number

1250
01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.300
three

1251
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.900
we want to reframe.

1252
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.200
issues

1253
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200
I mean by that is this.

1254
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:48.300
And you've got these hot political places in the United States, right? And

1255
01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.600
you've got standard problem points of publicans

1256
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.200
issues standing standard talking points Democrats.

1257
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.600
You know particularly.

1258
01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.300
And even when you align a lot more with one party

1259
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.400
than you do with the other and you align with them on the

1260
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:03.600
issue.

1261
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.100
As a Christian you might address that issue in a

1262
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:07.600
different manner.

1263
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.100
So that when you're speaking to that it should even if you come to

1264
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.100
the same conclusion as let's say a generic Republic somewhere.

1265
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.700
Or a generic Republican politically

1266
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.200
the function does he never come

1267
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.600
into the same conclusion that way you are particulated?

1268
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.300
You might give a different explanation for it as a Christian drawing on

1269
01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:26.600
the body.

1270
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.800
Or it might be that your tone is different.

1271
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.300
That you actually about demeaning integrated if

1272
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.000
you disagree with.

1273
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.000
it's honestly most of the we just

1274
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.100
have different solutions

1275
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.400
and even if their Solutions on solution is

1276
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.300
I mean horrible person who should be

1277
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.000
even if they're behavioral moment.

1278
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.700
You know we can still take them.

1279
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.500
As somebody created a good place God so the wrong.

1280
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.800
The way that doesn't agree.

1281
01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.700
So we can reframe issues and we can and then

1282
01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:03.900
finally.

1283
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.300
I've got this big term Revitalize both.

1284
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.300
That seems like a huge ass.

1285
01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.300
Like all right, Grace smart guy. How do

1286
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.700
I Revitalize it? My name is Frank. I

1287
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.300
probably, you know, my name is

1288
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.400
Michelle and I'm still whatever, you know,

1289
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.700
like we're saying earlier we take the broad.

1290
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.900
They belonging.

1291
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.200
What we do is we just say, this is God. I'm giving me.

1292
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.900
This family this journey.

1293
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.100
This place of work, it's Community to live

1294
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.800
in I'm gonna honor you that's the facility.

1295
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.400
and everything I do

1296
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.700
that revitalizes

1297
01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.000
the breakdown America

1298
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.400
a large part of it is great getting families to churches.

1299
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.000
Those are two of the most important institutions in our

1300
01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.100
culture. They're supposed to be a war.

1301
01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.200
against bad things and athletic

1302
01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.900
But our families are great.

1303
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.200
many of our churches

1304
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.300
that we can strengthen our families to strengthen our churches.

1305
01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.200
We can air our places.

1306
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.400
where if we can carry ourselves pretty well public

1307
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400
safer and not act down behave that

1308
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.200
and speak well on behalf. Good ambassadors.

1309
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.400
We are really.

1310
01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.000
And we can listen.

1311
01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.900
God works

1312
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.700
for the work of this, baby.

1313
01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.400
He Delights.

1314
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.100
and bringing fruit

1315
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.800
to the season we stop and so we're faithful

1316
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.700
we can trust that. God will do something.

1317
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.300
Faithfully sowing seeds

1318
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.000
the long game

1319
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.700
and the broad view I think that's

1320
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.200
man, we were hoping you would fix this thing tonight, but

1321
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.200
If that's not going to happen, we just want to say thank you for coming and being a

1322
01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.300
part of what we're doing here Church. Let's show him our appreciation.

1323
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.300
We also we just want to not only

1324
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.500
say thank you for giving us this night. But thank you for serving the lord. So

1325
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.400
Faithfully the way you do and representing Us

1326
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.300
in an arena that we don't really have access to I

1327
01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.100
think yeah, I'm encouraged and I knowing that you're

1328
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.100
you're there for us doing the hard work and the heavy lifting so

1329
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.300
All right. Well love this is

1330
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:41.200
not happened in the three weeks. We've been doing these these

1331
01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.300
topics but we have

1332
01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:45.900
10 minutes nine minutes left and we're not

1333
01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.400
going to take any questions from the audience because we don't

1334
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:48.800
have the

1335
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.500
Don't have the technology or the courage just the

1336
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.100
joke about the courage. We don't

1337
01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.100
have the technology but or the courage, but anyway,

1338
01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:03.200
I just want to say thank you for coming and and if

1339
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.300
and can I pray for you and for our

1340
01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.200
church as we go forward?

1341
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:08.900
Let's pray. Yes.

1342
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.300
Father thank you so much for the United

1343
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.400
States of America and how Lord you have been able to fund

1344
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.400
a missions globally through the middle class

1345
01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.900
here for so many years. But Lord as the cultural winds

1346
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.200
begin to blow in a

1347
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.400
different direction and as we begin to feel more marginalized and less

1348
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.300
free, I pray Lord you would allow us to remember that

1349
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.300
it is you and your power and your Sovereign way that

1350
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:34.800
direct us.

1351
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.300
The Lord let us do play the long game Lord.

1352
01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:41.200
Let us see the Broadway. Let us treat our

1353
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.200
our fellow brothers and sisters

1354
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.100
in Christ and our people in our family in a manner that people

1355
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.300
would take notice Lord. Let us plant seeds that would bear

1356
01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.200
fruit in righteousness. So that people could see who God

1357
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.500
is and who they're missing when they don't follow him.

1358
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.200
What I pray for Dr. Ashford, thank you for Lord for

1359
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.800
not only his willingness to be with us tonight. But for his faithfulness to

1360
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.500
represent you and your word and your truth

1361
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.900
in an arena Lord that that is

1362
01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.200
very few voices like his and I just pray Lord you would

1363
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.400
protect him Lord speak to him through him

1364
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.600
with power. And with that perfect balance

1365
01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.600
like Jesus had of Grace and Truth and

1366
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.000
it is in Jesus name that we pray. Amen.

1367
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.300
Amen. All right. Well, thank you, Dr.

1368
01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.500
Ashford and
