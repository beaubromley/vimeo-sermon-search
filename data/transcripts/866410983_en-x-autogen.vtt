1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.240
Hi, I'm Phil Sly.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.040
I'm the pastor of Discipleship and Community here at Henderson Hills,

3
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.560
and we're looking at community group certification.

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.320
We've looked at different roles, the role of the Bible teacher and the director,

5
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.560
and the prayer and care coordinator. Well,

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.440
tonight we're going to look at a key leader who's often unsung and humble,

7
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.400
yet plays a very significant role in the spiritual growth and the outreach of

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.233
the community group.

9
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.160
And this unsung hero is none other than an outreach and social leader. Now,

10
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.960
this role goes far beyond just organizing social groups or events or

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.000
programs. Uh,

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.720
this leader becomes the driving force by about fulfilling the great commission.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.280
They lead the mandate given to all believers by Jesus Christ himself.

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.000
And so we're gonna explore the importance of the social outreach leader in a

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.920
community group context by, uh,

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.640
drawing inspiration from both Matthew 28 19 and 20, and Acts one, eight.

17
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.280
So let's look at the outreach Social Leaders Great commission. Uh, the, uh,

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.600
great Commission is a call to reach people for Christ.

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.920
And so before diving into the role of the outreach leader,

20
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.560
it's essential that we understand the origin of this mission.

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.640
In Matthew 28, 19 and 20,

22
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.880
it encapsulates the mandate where Jesus instructs his disciples

23
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.920
to go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,

24
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.040
son of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you.

25
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.640
This commandment is known as the Great Commission,

26
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.440
and it extends to all believers,

27
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.960
and it serves literally as the cornerstone of Christian faith and living.

28
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.040
And so, uh, community groups,

29
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.320
were gonna play a significant role in fulfilling the Great Commission.

30
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.320
This is not the the staff's responsibility. This is not the, uh,

31
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.040
comms department's responsibility. This is all of our responsibility.

32
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.280
And so by inviting new members, uh,

33
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.840
into the community group at their events and at their socials,

34
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.040
they have an opportunity to intentionally connect with them and eventually teach

35
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.880
them about Jesus and the gospel so that they can come to know him and then maybe

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.320
grow in their faith. And so, uh, this is the Outreach Leader's Purpose.

37
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.960
An outreach leader embodies the,

38
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.760
in the essence of the Great Commission and serves as a bridge between,

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.040
uh, the, the community group and the world, uh, outside of the church walls.

40
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.240
And so their primary purpose as a, uh,

41
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.400
outreach social leader is to inspire and equip and mobilize fellow

42
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.160
believers to engage in evangelism and discipleship.

43
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.640
So here's some crucial aspects of their role. First one, spiritual leadership.

44
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.360
The outreach leader must exhibit a deep and authentic relationship of Christ.

45
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.960
They model the virtues of love and compassion and empathy.

46
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.800
Their life then becomes a living testimony of God's grace and serves

47
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.640
as an inspiration for others to follow. Ultimately, the community group should,

48
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.760
uh, learn through the example

49
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.520
Of this leader to create experiences and ultimately a multiplying

50
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.080
effect as these believers grow in their faith,

51
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.080
as they develop leadership strengths and experiences.

52
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.200
And then they go on to start new community groups because there's just not space

53
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.360
in the group where you're community group is meeting. Uh,

54
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.880
so that's spiritual leadership. Number two, organizing outreach socials.

55
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.840
An effective outreach social leader designs and coordinates various outreach

56
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.200
socials. Now,

57
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.520
this is a philosophical change in just a regular community group event.

58
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.600
Many community group events are created just so that people who know one another

59
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.960
can hang out together.

60
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.240
But what I'm asking you to do is to make those social events actual outreach

61
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.073
events,

62
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.960
to see that the community group mobilizes to invite people to their social

63
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.880
events that are outside of the group, neighbors and friends, maybe ball team,

64
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.760
parents, coworkers.

65
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.600
They're inviting people so that they can come inside from

66
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.360
outside and meet people within the community group,

67
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.840
whether they've ever been to the church or not. Uh, number three,

68
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.960
purpose is equipping the saints. Equipping the,

69
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.720
the community group for outreach is a significant aspect of the outreach

70
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.120
social leader, uh,

71
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.320
through talking and celebrating and mentorship and outreach opportunities,

72
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.080
they help community group members gain confidence in sharing their faith with

73
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.880
others and nurturing brand new disciples. Uh, d uh,

74
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.560
fostering a culture of reaching. This is so important for community groups,

75
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.200
especially those that are meeting, been meeting for a number of years. Uh,

76
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.880
the social outreach leader actively works to create a culture of

77
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.360
growth, of reaching, of evangelism, of living scent within the community group.

78
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.520
This involves encouraging open conversations about faith at these events.

79
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.280
It's,

80
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.000
it's about providing resources for personal evangelism and celebrating

81
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.720
stories of transformed lives. Uh, we used to call 'em testimonies,

82
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.840
but these are faith stories of how God has changed someone's life through a

83
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.480
relationship with Jesus. So,

84
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.720
community groups must develop a culture of vision that motivates them to reach

85
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.553
people for Christ.

86
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.960
They're better equipped to reach people for Christ than any other organization

87
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.440
in the church. Uh,

88
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.840
did you know community groups is Henderson Hill's largest organization,

89
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.880
and we meet all the time. We meet Sunday at nine, at 10 30,

90
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.760
at 5:00 PM Monday night at six 30, Wednesday nights at six 15. And,

91
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.050
uh,

92
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.640
these community groups can be organized effectively to quickly assimilate new

93
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.200
people and build new relationships. It happens every week. So, uh,

94
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.600
that's creating or fostering a culture of reaching. And so, uh,

95
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.080
a social outreach leader, uh, number two, we talked about Acts one,

96
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.040
eight is empowered by the Holy Spirit to comprehend how this is going

97
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.790
to happen.

98
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.240
This vast sweep of a social outreach leader's role,

99
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.080
we have to turn to Acts one, eight, where Jesus says,

100
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.480
you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,

101
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.080
and you'll be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,

102
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.320
and the ends of the earth.

103
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.680
So the Holy Spirit empowers believers to become bold witnesses

104
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.200
of the gospel. And an outreach leader,

105
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.160
outreach social leader plays a vital role in helping people discover and

106
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.080
utilize this Holy Spirit power. Uh,

107
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.160
one eight's also a reminder that our responsibility as a community group extends

108
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.760
beyond our intermediate, our immediate circle. Uh,

109
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.080
we're called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth,

110
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.800
sharing the good news of Jesus with all who will listen. So, uh,

111
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.160
community groups are, uh,

112
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.720
play a vital role in fulfilling this call to become God's witnesses.

113
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.000
And they do that by bringing new members from diverse backgrounds who all have

114
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.680
an opportunity to share the gospel with the people who are in that group.

115
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.760
And some may have never heard it before.

116
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.560
And this can be especially true about community groups that are intentional

117
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.320
about outreach and evangelism. And so,

118
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.520
as a community group welcomes new members,

119
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.600
they're expanding their reach and fulfilling their call to be witnesses to the

120
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.433
end of the earth.

121
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.480
The last thing I wanna talk to you about is the social outreach leader.

122
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.720
As a catalyst of transformation,

123
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.400
an effective outreach social leader becomes a catalyst for spiritual

124
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.600
transformation in both the community group and the church.

125
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.280
They facilitate this in several ways. First of all,

126
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.160
personal transformation by encouraging believers to actively participate in

127
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.273
outreach efforts.

128
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.120
The social outreach leader fosters personal growth and spiritual maturity in the

129
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.400
manner of Christ who is always, uh,

130
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.080
going to those who are not a part of the inner circle.

131
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.200
They engage in evangelism and,

132
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.760
and discipleship and provide opportunities for people within their community

133
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.320
group to step outside their comfort zone and rely on the Holy Spirit's power.

134
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.520
So that's personal transformation, but there's also unity and fellowship.

135
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.840
What that means is that outreach initiatives bring the community group together

136
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.320
for a shared purpose.

137
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.800
I've seen this happen where a community group plans a social event.

138
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.440
This was a Christmas party, and I know community groups have Christmas parties,

139
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.600
but they made this an intentional outreach event. And one lady, uh,

140
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.080
asked for prayer for her husband who she knew was not a believer.

141
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.080
He never comes to church. He doesn't support me in my spiritual efforts,

142
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.400
but I know I can get him to come to the Christmas party. And so, uh,

143
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.560
we as a community group begin to pray for this lady's husband.

144
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.800
And what happened on that night, he shows up.

145
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.360
And so now it's more than a Christmas party.

146
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.400
It's an opportunity to lead this lady's husbands to Jesus.

147
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.920
And long story short, he did start attending the community group,

148
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.960
and he did place his faith in Christ. And so, uh,

149
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.960
believers who work hand in hand to reach others,

150
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.840
they strengthen their bonds one to another,

151
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.280
and they create a tightly knit community of faith with a purpose for reaching

152
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.400
people for Jesus. And then next is the impact on the community.

153
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.040
A dedicated outreach leader can significantly impact the community group by

154
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.760
addressing various needs such as loneliness and spiritual emptiness.

155
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.400
Uh, in my lifetime, and I'm on the older side of,

156
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.360
of adulthood in my lifetime,

157
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.640
I've never seen the culture as lonely as they are as a result of C O V I D.

158
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.280
And as a result of a a working from home,

159
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.080
there are so many people that have reported just a epic, um,

160
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.760
an epidemic of loneliness.

161
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.320
And we have an opportunity to extend what God has given us beyond the walls of

162
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.760
the church and spread the message of hope and love to those who are loneliest,

163
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.760
who need it the most. And, uh,

164
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.080
what I want you to to understand is in the economy of God, uh,

165
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.160
leading out, uh, leading out an outreach comes with both challenges,

166
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.840
but also with rewards. Yes,

167
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.280
there will be periods of discouragement as the, you may as a leader,

168
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.400
face resistance. And we just wanna have a party.

169
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.240
We don't wanna invite a bunch of people. Well,

170
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.640
that's not the purpose of the church. And so yeah,

171
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.640
you might res face some resistance, but there will also be rewards and,

172
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.000
uh, rewards for your labor. Uh, listen to this, uh,

173
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.960
witnessing results in transformed lives, hearts turning to Christ,

174
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.880
commitments to experience Christ's love and restoration.

175
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.240
These are immeasurable, invaluable rewards. And, uh,

176
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.680
and I wanna just go on record as saying that of all the roles reaching people

177
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.520
for Christ and the purpose of the community group,

178
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.640
this is the highest purpose of Christian community. Um,

179
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.640
the social outreach leader is the,

180
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.560
is the catalyst for helping the community group understand its role in growth

181
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.680
and evangelism.

182
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.680
And through their spiritual leadership and dedication in organization,

183
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.920
they can equip and empower fellow believers in the community group to become

184
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.400
effective witnesses of Christ's love.

185
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.520
And inspired by Christ and inspired by the, inspired by the Biblical ma, uh,

186
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.680
models in scripture and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit,

187
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.200
the social outreach leader literally becomes an agent of transformation and

188
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.360
impacts both the community group and the church overall.

189
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.800
And so my prayer is that at Henderson Hills,

190
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.640
we would strive to become a beacon of light in a dark world and world.

191
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.400
And the role of the community group outreach leader remains of utmost importance

192
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.760
because they uphold the very essence of Christianity.

193
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.880
And that is to go and make disciples of all nations.
