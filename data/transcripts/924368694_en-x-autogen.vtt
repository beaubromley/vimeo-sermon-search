00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:03.625
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.825
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:09.545
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.905
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:17.065
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:27.545
Well, good morning. My name is Mark Kellerman.

7
00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:29.425
I'm the residency director here,

8
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:33.785
and it's my honor to guide us through Psalm 64 as we

9
00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:37.225
continue our series in John's absence.

10
00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:39.185
He's away for some much needed

11
00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.225
and well deserved r and r with his family.

12
00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:44.105
So I'd encourage you to be praying for him and for them.

13
00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.785
But if you would please turn with me to Psalm chapter 64

14
00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:51.585
as we open God's word together.

15
00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.705
Now, as you, uh, as you're turning there,

16
00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:58.225
whether you're turning on your phone or device

17
00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:00.825
or flipping there in your Bible, if you need a Bible,

18
00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:03.465
we have them available underneath the seats.

19
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:06.625
Um, if you need a Bible, like you actually have no Bible,

20
00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:07.705
please come talk to us.

21
00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:09.585
We would love to give you a Bible.

22
00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.745
But I wanna begin by asking you a

23
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.265
question as you find your place.

24
00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:19.225
Have you ever experienced fear in an overcoming sort of way?

25
00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:21.665
Maybe in a way that you would say it was even a

26
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:22.705
bit paralyzing.

27
00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:26.425
Maybe there was a doctor's report that you were anticipating

28
00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:28.145
and you were afraid.

29
00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.145
Perhaps it was financial news

30
00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:32.185
and there was news that was coming that

31
00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:34.905
potentially could be devastating.

32
00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.865
Maybe you lost touch with a loved one who you were supposed

33
00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.425
to meet up with but you haven't heard from in hours

34
00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:42.905
and you don't know how to get ahold

35
00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:44.825
of them or what has happened.

36
00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:47.985
Maybe you've been in actual literal physical danger

37
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:53.745
and you know what that is like maybe you've been in law

38
00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:55.585
enforcement, military seen combat,

39
00:01:56.805 --> 00:02:00.745
and when fear can get a hold of you, it's like an icy grip

40
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:02.465
that won't let go.

41
00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.065
I we're talking this morning about fear.

42
00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:08.585
I think it's something we can all relate to.

43
00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:13.465
Merriam Webster's dictionary defines fear as an unpleasant

44
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.465
emotion caused by the belief that someone

45
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:19.945
or something is dangerous.

46
00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:24.385
It's likely to cause pain or harm or it is a threat.

47
00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.985
So fear, sometimes it's hard to distinguish

48
00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:30.265
from the threat itself,

49
00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:34.705
but it is an emotion, it's a feeling, it's a state of mind,

50
00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:37.425
an internal response to a sort of

51
00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:39.265
external threat and danger.

52
00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:40.865
It's either real or imagined.

53
00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:43.425
It's physical or emotional, it's psychological.

54
00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:46.305
It can even be spiritual in nature.

55
00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:52.025
But fear itself can be quite crippling, can rob you

56
00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:54.785
of your peace of mind, can affect the way you sleep,

57
00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:56.865
how much you eat or how little

58
00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:00.405
it can affect your relationships with other people.

59
00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:03.805
It can affect your relationship with God himself even.

60
00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:08.215
So how do you tend to respond

61
00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:10.535
when fear takes hold of you?

62
00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:14.655
Beyond that, not only how do you respond, how should we

63
00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:17.935
respond as Christians,

64
00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.495
Psalm 64 I think is a good guide for us in light

65
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.655
of these questions.

66
00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:30.015
Uh, to begin with Psalm 64, as it says here in

67
00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:32.815
what we call the superscription, this is, uh, part

68
00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:34.695
of the original text of the Bible.

69
00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:39.055
In your, in your Bible, it says Chapter 64, mine says,

70
00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:40.615
hide me from the Wicked.

71
00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.535
That's sort of a, a recent title.

72
00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:45.215
It's just prompting us to know what's coming.

73
00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:49.175
But then in the book of Psalms, there's a lot of, a lot

74
00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:51.655
of times that this label is here

75
00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:55.415
and it says something like this to the choir master

76
00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:57.215
a Psalm of David.

77
00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:01.815
Now that's in the original Hebrew text, as old

78
00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.015
as the rest of the Bible.

79
00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:04.935
And what that indicates is two things.

80
00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:08.215
One, this is a Psalm of David either written

81
00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:09.855
by him or about him.

82
00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:12.015
I think likely it is both.

83
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:15.095
And it's also to the choir master.

84
00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:18.775
So this is a prayer of David's, which was meant

85
00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:20.375
to be sung as a song.

86
00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:23.415
So keep that in mind as we read this.

87
00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:27.775
David in Psalm 64, he is faced with fear.

88
00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:29.895
He has an enemy.

89
00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:33.135
This is a person or perhaps a group of people

90
00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:35.175
that are conspiring against him,

91
00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:38.175
and it leads him to God in prayer

92
00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:41.095
as a response, he prays to God.

93
00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:43.215
And what we find, and this is where I get the title

94
00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.575
of my message this morning, is that we, he moves,

95
00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:51.335
we watch David move from fear to faith,

96
00:04:52.765 --> 00:04:56.505
and his enemies become, even his fear becomes

97
00:04:57.205 --> 00:05:01.945
an opportunity for him to experience and know God better.

98
00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:05.385
And I think that's the invitation of Psalm 64.

99
00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:07.105
This is where we're headed this morning.

100
00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:09.945
And I think that the overall effect

101
00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:13.065
of Psalm 64 is, is aimed at this.

102
00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:15.265
It is meant to encourage

103
00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:19.225
and comfort God's people in who are faced with fear

104
00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:20.905
and enemies that are beyond them.

105
00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:24.025
But there's another aspect we'll see later on,

106
00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:27.585
and that is that this psalm also confronts us.

107
00:05:28.085 --> 00:05:31.865
And I wanna invite you to join me as we see all of this

108
00:05:32.485 --> 00:05:33.625
in Psalm 64.

109
00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:36.065
So if you would, in fact, I'm gonna, I just wanna read

110
00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:39.025
through the entire chapter if you would follow along.

111
00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:40.945
But I would invite you if you're able to please stand

112
00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:43.665
with me in honor of the reading of God's word.

113
00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:47.945
And please follow along as I read beginning of verse one,

114
00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.725
hear my voice, oh God, in my complaint,

115
00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:57.645
preserve my life from dread of the enemy.

116
00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:03.165
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng

117
00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:07.005
of evil doers who wet their tongues like swords

118
00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:11.485
who aim bitter words like arrows, shooting from ambush,

119
00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:15.445
shooting at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly

120
00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:20.445
and without fear, they hold fast to their evil purpose.

121
00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:23.565
They talk of laying snares secretly

122
00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:25.045
thinking who can see them?

123
00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:27.965
They search out injustice saying,

124
00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:33.045
we have accomplished a diligent search for the inward mind

125
00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:35.325
and heart of a man are deep,

126
00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:41.385
but God shoots his arrow at them.

127
00:06:42.515 --> 00:06:46.805
They are wounded. Suddenly they are brought to ruin

128
00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:50.005
with their own tongues turned against them all

129
00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:52.525
who see them will wag their heads.

130
00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:58.005
Then all mankind fears, they tell what God has brought about

131
00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:00.045
and ponder what he has done.

132
00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:03.845
Let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord

133
00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:05.645
and take refuge in him.

134
00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:11.085
Let all the upright in heart exalt. Let's pray.

135
00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:16.625
Almighty God, we thank you this morning for the light

136
00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:20.305
of your word in Psalm 64 to us.

137
00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:25.105
God, I pray that as these words wash over our minds

138
00:07:25.605 --> 00:07:28.185
and enter into our hearts, I pray that you would speak them

139
00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:33.145
to us by your spirit, that we would be changed

140
00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:36.385
by your word, by your presence, by your power.

141
00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:40.825
We pray in Jesus' mighty name. Amen. You may be seated.

142
00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:46.625
So our first point here, if you're following in the outline,

143
00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:49.345
is we move from fear to faith.

144
00:07:49.895 --> 00:07:53.265
When you realize that God hears

145
00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:55.665
you, God hears you.

146
00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:57.185
Let me read it again in verse one.

147
00:07:57.655 --> 00:08:00.945
Hear my voice, oh God, in my complaint,

148
00:08:01.945 --> 00:08:04.865
preserve my life from dread of the enemy.

149
00:08:05.605 --> 00:08:09.465
So David asks God that he would hear his voice,

150
00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:13.505
and specifically David's voice comes in the form

151
00:08:14.165 --> 00:08:15.185
of a complaint.

152
00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:18.505
Now, there's nothing wrong with complaining to God.

153
00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:21.065
In fact, most of the time we complain to other people.

154
00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:24.305
So complaining to God is actually an improvement, you think.

155
00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:28.145
Um, and I think, uh,

156
00:08:29.135 --> 00:08:33.985
what we find here is an invitation from God in his word

157
00:08:34.085 --> 00:08:38.425
to pray to God about anything and everything.

158
00:08:38.445 --> 00:08:41.945
In fact, that reminds me of Philippians chapter four,

159
00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:45.585
verses six to seven, which says, do not be anxious

160
00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:49.945
about anything, but in everything by prayer

161
00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:52.265
and supplication with thanksgiving,

162
00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.945
let your requests be made known to God

163
00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:59.605
and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding.

164
00:08:59.635 --> 00:09:02.485
Meaning it doesn't depend on your circumstances,

165
00:09:03.025 --> 00:09:04.765
it doesn't depend on whether you've got it

166
00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:05.885
all figured out or not.

167
00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:08.645
It's because God has it all figured out, right?

168
00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:12.565
It's because God's circumstance supersedes all

169
00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:13.605
of the other ones.

170
00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:16.755
And so it's not based on our understanding.

171
00:09:16.925 --> 00:09:20.395
Again, it will guard your hearts

172
00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:23.435
and your minds in Christ Jesus.

173
00:09:24.775 --> 00:09:27.955
One Peter five, six to seven tells us to humble ourselves

174
00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:32.515
before God's mighty hand, casting all our anxiety on him.

175
00:09:32.975 --> 00:09:36.955
Why? Because he cares for us.

176
00:09:38.015 --> 00:09:41.395
So because God is good and because God is God and

177
00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:42.795
because God is there and

178
00:09:42.795 --> 00:09:46.395
because he cares for you, then we know

179
00:09:46.395 --> 00:09:50.875
that there is a gracious invitation from God

180
00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:53.395
to us that we would draw near to him

181
00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:56.115
and that we would talk to him about anything

182
00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:59.875
and everything, especially those things that concern us,

183
00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:01.675
even our complaints.

184
00:10:02.695 --> 00:10:04.555
So I think the truth is here,

185
00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:06.755
this is a a, a fact in a reality.

186
00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:09.235
If you're a believer in Christ, you've been in church

187
00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:11.795
for a while, this is not news to you hopefully.

188
00:10:12.255 --> 00:10:13.395
But here's the reality.

189
00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:15.555
I believe more times than not,

190
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.235
we take this far too casually.

191
00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:22.515
We need to be much more amazed by this reality

192
00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:24.035
that the most important

193
00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.475
and the most powerful being in the universe,

194
00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:29.715
indeed the most important

195
00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:34.475
and the most powerful person in the universe has

196
00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:37.315
promised to hear you when you speak to him.

197
00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:41.635
And that's something I think we can be more amazed by.

198
00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:44.875
Beyond that, I think what's also happening here.

199
00:10:45.135 --> 00:10:48.675
So David's complaining in, in perhaps even the current use

200
00:10:48.675 --> 00:10:51.555
of that word, but I think there could be like a legal

201
00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:53.515
complaint that he's bringing

202
00:10:53.615 --> 00:10:56.795
before the judge of all the universe, the only one

203
00:10:56.855 --> 00:11:00.275
who is righteous and just the only place he knows he will

204
00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:04.155
actually be heard and actually receive total justice.

205
00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:07.035
It's at the throne of God himself.

206
00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:10.595
And so he brings his complaint, and this is our first point.

207
00:11:10.735 --> 00:11:15.715
We move from fear to faith when we know that God hears you,

208
00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:17.475
when you know that God hears you.

209
00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:21.155
So our second point about moving from fear to faith

210
00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:25.395
is when we understand not only that God hears you,

211
00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:28.635
but also that God hides you

212
00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:30.955
also, that God hides you.

213
00:11:31.035 --> 00:11:33.915
I wanna read in again verse one through verse six,

214
00:11:34.615 --> 00:11:38.075
and listen to the nature of David's enemies

215
00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:39.275
as he describes them.

216
00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:42.515
Hear my voice, oh God.

217
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:46.955
And my complaint, preserve my life from dread of the enemy.

218
00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:51.075
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked,

219
00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:53.805
from the throng of evil doers

220
00:11:53.865 --> 00:11:56.205
who wet their tongues like swords,

221
00:11:56.825 --> 00:11:58.925
who aim bitter words like arrows,

222
00:11:59.445 --> 00:12:01.405
shooting from ambush at the blameless,

223
00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:05.885
shooting at him suddenly and without fear, they hold fast

224
00:12:05.945 --> 00:12:07.445
to their evil purpose.

225
00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:10.285
They talk of laying snares secretly

226
00:12:10.285 --> 00:12:11.805
thinking who can see them?

227
00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:15.645
They search out injustice saying We have

228
00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:17.605
accomplished a diligent search.

229
00:12:18.085 --> 00:12:20.045
I like the new living translation, which says,

230
00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:22.605
we have devised the perfect plot

231
00:12:25.325 --> 00:12:27.545
for the inward mind and heart of a man.

232
00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:32.905
Our deep. Not only does David ask that God would hear him,

233
00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:36.945
but he also asks that God would preserve his life.

234
00:12:37.655 --> 00:12:41.065
He's actually concerned about his life as these people are

235
00:12:41.785 --> 00:12:42.825
collaborating against him.

236
00:12:43.005 --> 00:12:46.385
He asked God to hide him from the hidden ambush

237
00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:47.625
of these enemies.

238
00:12:47.895 --> 00:12:52.385
They were secret, they were devious, crafty and cunning.

239
00:12:52.965 --> 00:12:53.985
And David, you know,

240
00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:57.305
may have been a mighty warrior in and of his own right.

241
00:12:57.685 --> 00:12:58.825
And he was indeed,

242
00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:03.025
but he was no match for an enemy that he could not see.

243
00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:05.865
And that's what David has encountered here,

244
00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:07.465
and this is why he's praying.

245
00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:12.905
In verse two it says, they make secret plots in verse three,

246
00:13:12.935 --> 00:13:15.345
they aimed words like deadly weapons.

247
00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:17.785
In verse four, they wore camouflage

248
00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:20.785
and planned surprise attacks in verses five to six.

249
00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:24.425
They are laying traps that were hidden and deceptive.

250
00:13:25.445 --> 00:13:29.305
And, and the dangers as as David is enumerating them.

251
00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:33.625
They repeat, they deepen, they amplify

252
00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:34.865
and enlarge.

253
00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:38.425
And David felt this paralyzing sense of fear.

254
00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:40.185
He calls it dread.

255
00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:42.625
I have this dread of the enemy in verse one.

256
00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:47.705
And he felt needy, exposed and vulnerable.

257
00:13:48.775 --> 00:13:52.265
Therefore, David is crying out to God for protection.

258
00:13:54.315 --> 00:13:55.415
Do you know how that feels?

259
00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:58.775
Have you ever felt in like,

260
00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.935
like this in any way for any reason?

261
00:14:01.915 --> 00:14:06.095
You know, your enemies might not be quite like David's are

262
00:14:06.365 --> 00:14:09.615
Exactly, but we all have a deadly enemy.

263
00:14:10.035 --> 00:14:11.695
And the Bible is very clear about this.

264
00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:14.855
Jesus describes him in John 10 10

265
00:14:15.275 --> 00:14:19.655
and says that he comes to steal, kill, and to destroy.

266
00:14:20.275 --> 00:14:24.095
And indeed, spiritually speaking, this is the enemy

267
00:14:24.115 --> 00:14:27.335
of our soul, Satan himself, and the power of sin

268
00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:29.255
and darkness in the world around us.

269
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.575
Because you see, Satan hates God.

270
00:14:32.275 --> 00:14:34.215
And how does he wage war against him?

271
00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:38.935
Well, one of the ways he does is he assaults God's people.

272
00:14:39.835 --> 00:14:42.455
He assaults anyone no matter

273
00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:44.735
who they are in the image of God.

274
00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:48.295
Because all humanity is born in the image of God made,

275
00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:51.405
even though it's broken, made in the image of God.

276
00:14:51.785 --> 00:14:53.285
And Satan attacks mankind

277
00:14:53.745 --> 00:14:56.365
and Satan attacks those that are in Jesus Christ

278
00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:58.205
as a way of attacking God.

279
00:14:58.345 --> 00:15:00.805
He comes to steal, kill, and to destroy.

280
00:15:00.905 --> 00:15:03.165
And he is a mighty foe.

281
00:15:03.665 --> 00:15:06.365
In fact, he is beyond us the even act,

282
00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:07.965
the evil actions of other people.

283
00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:11.525
Like when you encounter, uh, enemies of a variety

284
00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:13.365
of kinds in your life, real people,

285
00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:16.445
the truth is there's a way that sin

286
00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:18.165
and darkness lies behind that.

287
00:15:18.425 --> 00:15:20.565
That's actually the ultimate driving force.

288
00:15:21.065 --> 00:15:24.965
We read about this in Ephesians six, verse 12 says,

289
00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:27.565
for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood.

290
00:15:27.765 --> 00:15:29.885
I mean, you might say, hold on.

291
00:15:30.785 --> 00:15:32.845
No, I actually had a fight with that guy.

292
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:36.325
Okay, so there's actual flesh and blood that's at work,

293
00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:38.485
but the reality is the flesh

294
00:15:38.485 --> 00:15:40.285
and blood is not the ultimate source.

295
00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:42.365
The ultimate source is beyond that.

296
00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:46.005
We wrestle not only against flesh and blood,

297
00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:48.765
but against the rulers, against the authorities,

298
00:15:48.765 --> 00:15:51.805
against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,

299
00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:56.765
against the spiritual forces of evil in heavenly places.

300
00:15:56.945 --> 00:15:59.205
And like it or not, you

301
00:15:59.205 --> 00:16:03.885
and I are simply no match for enemies like that.

302
00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:06.845
Those that are potent and hidden,

303
00:16:07.585 --> 00:16:09.485
and we are no match for them.

304
00:16:09.745 --> 00:16:10.885
So how do we respond?

305
00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:14.445
According to Psalm 64, we respond

306
00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:16.765
by hiding ourselves in God.

307
00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:18.845
Let me illustrate this in a way.

308
00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.805
Um, I don't know how many of you maybe hunters

309
00:16:21.025 --> 00:16:23.445
or animal lovers, believe it

310
00:16:23.445 --> 00:16:24.805
or not, there's not much difference.

311
00:16:25.225 --> 00:16:29.445
Um, so, so I think about like deer

312
00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:33.445
and elk, like, like these big game animals, okay?

313
00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:38.285
These are very strong, uh, relatively intelligent, uh, very,

314
00:16:38.515 --> 00:16:39.805
very fast at times.

315
00:16:40.345 --> 00:16:43.525
Uh, highly attuned sense of, um,

316
00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:45.565
ability to survive.

317
00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:48.285
And, and so what happens when this kind of,

318
00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:51.165
these animals can, can avoid all kinds of predators.

319
00:16:51.265 --> 00:16:55.165
But what happens when the danger of bullets

320
00:16:55.185 --> 00:16:57.005
and arrows begin to fly?

321
00:16:57.515 --> 00:17:00.805
Well, they understand enough to put that into action

322
00:17:01.025 --> 00:17:03.045
and they go looking for a place to hide.

323
00:17:03.745 --> 00:17:07.565
In fact, they like refuges. We call them wildlife refuges.

324
00:17:08.025 --> 00:17:10.725
Um, and so you, you think about, I we,

325
00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:12.765
we moved recently from Colorado.

326
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.725
We live near the Rocky Mountain National Park, which is a

327
00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:19.445
nature preserve of over 400 square miles.

328
00:17:19.755 --> 00:17:22.245
It's over 200,000 acres

329
00:17:22.785 --> 00:17:25.605
of un huntable wilderness.

330
00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.965
And and especially during hunting season,

331
00:17:28.545 --> 00:17:32.525
the elk in particular will gather there by the thousands

332
00:17:32.525 --> 00:17:35.765
because they're seeking refuge, they're hiding.

333
00:17:36.295 --> 00:17:39.245
These are big, strong, capable creatures,

334
00:17:39.465 --> 00:17:41.725
and yet they need something larger than

335
00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:43.525
themselves to protect them.

336
00:17:43.905 --> 00:17:46.405
In fact, you see this picture right here, this is an,

337
00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.005
a picture I took a few years ago,

338
00:17:48.345 --> 00:17:50.725
and you notice that the guy is shooting him

339
00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:52.805
with a camera and not a weapon.

340
00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:55.805
Like if he was outside the park just a mile

341
00:17:55.805 --> 00:17:58.725
or two away, that same guy could be shooting at him.

342
00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.885
But he knows, and he wouldn't even be there.

343
00:18:00.945 --> 00:18:02.245
He would run from people.

344
00:18:02.905 --> 00:18:05.605
But in that context, they just walked through the cars

345
00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:07.165
and pass the camera man.

346
00:18:07.825 --> 00:18:09.845
And because they know that they are safe

347
00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:13.165
when they take refuge in that environment.

348
00:18:14.585 --> 00:18:16.445
So in the same way you

349
00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:18.365
and I are no match

350
00:18:18.785 --> 00:18:22.085
for our many enemies like David himself,

351
00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:25.805
our own self-reliance, our own natural

352
00:18:26.365 --> 00:18:28.845
resources are just simply not enough.

353
00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:32.685
And we must take refuge in God and let him hide

354
00:18:33.225 --> 00:18:35.485
and protect us like a, like a good father

355
00:18:35.585 --> 00:18:37.805
who would shield his children from danger

356
00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:38.965
or bullies or whatever.

357
00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:42.445
We need to hide in God because we know that he loves

358
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:43.885
and receives us.

359
00:18:43.905 --> 00:18:46.125
We move from fear to faith.

360
00:18:46.155 --> 00:18:51.045
When we believe that God hides us, it's our third point.

361
00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:52.645
You move from fear to faith.

362
00:18:52.645 --> 00:18:56.645
When you see that God defends you, God not only hides you,

363
00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:58.685
but he actively defends you.

364
00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:01.405
We read about this in verses seven and eight,

365
00:19:03.625 --> 00:19:06.805
but God shoots his arrow at them.

366
00:19:07.265 --> 00:19:09.765
At these enemies they are wounded.

367
00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:12.365
Suddenly they are brought to ruin

368
00:19:12.475 --> 00:19:16.365
with their own tongues turned against them all

369
00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:18.525
who see them will wag their heads.

370
00:19:21.085 --> 00:19:24.095
Here we encounter one of the most encouraging

371
00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:27.775
and reassuring phrases in the whole Bible.

372
00:19:28.715 --> 00:19:29.855
Two simple words.

373
00:19:30.475 --> 00:19:33.455
And I would encourage you to memorize these

374
00:19:33.835 --> 00:19:36.295
and base your entire life on them.

375
00:19:37.415 --> 00:19:40.975
Grammatically speaking, it's a conjunction and a noun.

376
00:19:41.355 --> 00:19:44.535
The words, but, and God, right?

377
00:19:45.075 --> 00:19:49.255
But God, it means except for God, these enemies,

378
00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:51.695
these threats are haunting us.

379
00:19:51.965 --> 00:19:56.015
They're overcoming us except for God.

380
00:19:56.075 --> 00:19:58.655
We encountered this phrase a few weeks ago when

381
00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:01.655
Aaron Ferguson was preaching on the doctrine of salvation.

382
00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:06.695
In Ephesians chapter two, it said, you in your natural state

383
00:20:07.245 --> 00:20:09.215
were broken, separated from God.

384
00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:11.895
You were dead in your trespasses and sins.

385
00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:16.835
But God, what did God do?

386
00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:20.515
God caused you to be born again

387
00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:25.595
and he brought you from death to life through Jesus Christ.

388
00:20:25.695 --> 00:20:29.875
And so we were dead, but God, we were brought to life.

389
00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:35.205
David's enemies were cunning, hidden, dangerous and scary.

390
00:20:36.595 --> 00:20:39.375
But God knows God is there.

391
00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:41.945
God is mighty.

392
00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:46.225
God is good, and God defends his people.

393
00:20:47.175 --> 00:20:51.715
And here David's fear begins to melt away in Psalm 64

394
00:20:51.935 --> 00:20:55.515
as he contemplates the nature of God himself.

395
00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.435
You know what happens when we get afraid

396
00:20:58.495 --> 00:21:00.075
or terrified by our circumstances

397
00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:01.435
or the enemies in our lives?

398
00:21:01.735 --> 00:21:05.235
We, we see them. And the truth is, to some extent, we begin

399
00:21:05.435 --> 00:21:07.115
to have faith in them.

400
00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:11.715
We believe, excuse me, we believe

401
00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:15.115
that they're able to bring their threats to pass.

402
00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:19.235
But when we follow David here, we begin to see

403
00:21:19.235 --> 00:21:21.715
and behold God and exert our faith in God.

404
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:24.315
And we see what God can do and what God has promised

405
00:21:24.415 --> 00:21:29.075
and what God is doing, then the fear begins to melt away.

406
00:21:29.075 --> 00:21:30.875
Verse seven says,

407
00:21:31.095 --> 00:21:35.035
but God shoots his arrow at them.

408
00:21:35.035 --> 00:21:39.355
Notice he only needs one and they are wounded.

409
00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:43.915
Suddenly, David's enemies would plot hide, whisper, slander,

410
00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:47.275
and lie shooting at him from ambush,

411
00:21:47.755 --> 00:21:49.195
shooting suddenly and without fear.

412
00:21:49.535 --> 00:21:53.235
But the Lord has set an ambush for them.

413
00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:57.985
The fix is in, they make their threats.

414
00:21:58.205 --> 00:22:00.825
But God has a threat of his own

415
00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:02.985
and they don't even see it coming.

416
00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:05.185
We read about it in verse eight.

417
00:22:05.255 --> 00:22:06.625
They're brought to ruin

418
00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:10.425
with their own tongues turned against them all

419
00:22:10.485 --> 00:22:12.545
who see them will wag their heads.

420
00:22:12.895 --> 00:22:14.585
It's like a boomerang of justice

421
00:22:14.695 --> 00:22:16.505
that brings their evil deeds

422
00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:19.265
and plans back upon their own heads

423
00:22:19.325 --> 00:22:21.865
and it brings them to ruin and mockery.

424
00:22:21.955 --> 00:22:25.185
Maybe you're familiar with the book of Esther, where, uh,

425
00:22:25.515 --> 00:22:29.025
Haman, the bad guy of the story, he had built some gallows.

426
00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:30.785
He was going to hang Mordecai on it.

427
00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:32.585
And what happened at the end of the story,

428
00:22:33.325 --> 00:22:34.385
he was the one hung.

429
00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:36.865
Instead, this is a boomerang

430
00:22:36.865 --> 00:22:40.145
of God's righteous justice on the wicked.

431
00:22:40.645 --> 00:22:42.945
The result is that they're held in contempt.

432
00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:46.025
The fear they sought to impose on others

433
00:22:46.635 --> 00:22:49.865
comes down upon their own heads in mockery and ruin.

434
00:22:50.175 --> 00:22:54.025
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord God Almighty.

435
00:22:55.205 --> 00:22:59.745
And you move from fear to faith When you come to see

436
00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:03.465
that God is the one who actively defends you.

437
00:23:05.145 --> 00:23:07.725
We hear the voice of fear,

438
00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:12.885
but God hears our voice in prayer, hearing, hiding

439
00:23:13.905 --> 00:23:15.405
and defending us.

440
00:23:16.225 --> 00:23:18.245
And the reality is the results

441
00:23:18.985 --> 00:23:22.325
and the effect of this can be quite dramatic.

442
00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:25.405
We read about it in the last two verses, verse nine

443
00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:29.725
and 10, then all mankind fears

444
00:23:30.795 --> 00:23:32.965
they tell what God has brought about

445
00:23:33.385 --> 00:23:35.645
and ponder what he has done.

446
00:23:36.745 --> 00:23:39.445
The let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord

447
00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:40.925
and take refuge in him.

448
00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:46.565
Let all the upright in heart exalt you can begin

449
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.765
to move from fear to faith.

450
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:52.565
We see right here when God delights you,

451
00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:54.565
there are two things that are going on here

452
00:23:54.985 --> 00:23:57.445
and let's take them in turn verse nine.

453
00:23:58.465 --> 00:24:03.205
All mankind fears then they tell what God has brought about

454
00:24:03.585 --> 00:24:05.685
and they ponder what he has done.

455
00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:08.725
There's two different kinds of fear at work in this passage.

456
00:24:09.305 --> 00:24:13.205
One is the crippling kind of fear that an evil adversary

457
00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:14.725
or circumstance can bring.

458
00:24:15.065 --> 00:24:18.925
And the other is the liberating, healing, life giving,

459
00:24:19.115 --> 00:24:22.365
life altering fear of the Lord,

460
00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:26.285
which proverb chapter nine tells us, is the very beginning

461
00:24:26.285 --> 00:24:27.805
of wisdom itself.

462
00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:31.325
Think about another analogy from the Bible.

463
00:24:31.935 --> 00:24:34.925
Think about when Israel was crossing the Red Sea,

464
00:24:35.365 --> 00:24:37.325
escaping from slavery in Egypt

465
00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:40.965
and the army of Pharaoh was descending upon them

466
00:24:41.185 --> 00:24:43.685
and God's justice fell upon that army

467
00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:45.605
and destroyed them completely.

468
00:24:46.535 --> 00:24:48.725
God's people were dramatically saved,

469
00:24:48.725 --> 00:24:50.805
their enemies were destroyed.

470
00:24:50.905 --> 00:24:54.845
And what happened? Everyone wrote songs and sang about it.

471
00:24:55.755 --> 00:24:57.525
More than that, ancient Israel learned

472
00:24:57.525 --> 00:24:59.405
that God was truly there

473
00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:03.165
and the surrounding nations that would've been hostile

474
00:25:03.345 --> 00:25:06.285
to them, all of them were put on notice.

475
00:25:07.155 --> 00:25:09.125
Have you ever experienced anything like that?

476
00:25:09.685 --> 00:25:11.605
I certainly don't mean that dramatic,

477
00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:14.925
but I mean, have you ever, in either in your own life

478
00:25:15.345 --> 00:25:18.365
or perhaps in the lives of people around you, seen

479
00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:21.645
and witnessed God work in such dramatic ways

480
00:25:21.915 --> 00:25:25.485
that it causes you and other people to think about God

481
00:25:25.545 --> 00:25:29.685
and talk about God and begin to revere him even more?

482
00:25:29.715 --> 00:25:33.565
This is the result that we see in Psalm 64.

483
00:25:34.305 --> 00:25:36.965
And um, so the invitation is that we would see

484
00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:40.045
and that we would behold what God has done

485
00:25:40.425 --> 00:25:41.885
and that we would worship him

486
00:25:42.225 --> 00:25:44.725
and that we would get to know him better.

487
00:25:45.905 --> 00:25:48.285
And this brings us to the Psalms close.

488
00:25:48.465 --> 00:25:50.845
Now, this is not quite my close yet,

489
00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:53.085
but this is the psalmist close.

490
00:25:53.225 --> 00:25:57.805
So in verse 10, we read again, let the righteous one

491
00:25:58.325 --> 00:26:01.965
rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him.

492
00:26:02.745 --> 00:26:06.005
Let all the upright in heart exalt.

493
00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:09.845
So David concludes with this admonition.

494
00:26:10.565 --> 00:26:13.485
Rejoice in the Lord, take refuge in him

495
00:26:14.145 --> 00:26:16.405
and celebrate like you mean it.

496
00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:19.325
That's my definition for exalt.

497
00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.045
So be glad in God.

498
00:26:23.105 --> 00:26:25.805
Uh, Nehemiah chapter eight, verse 10 says, the joy

499
00:26:25.825 --> 00:26:27.485
of the Lord, it's God's joy.

500
00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:30.085
That is your actual strength.

501
00:26:31.265 --> 00:26:34.565
So rejoice, be glad in him like the deer

502
00:26:34.585 --> 00:26:38.845
or the elk being hunted, take refuge in him, hide in God,

503
00:26:40.025 --> 00:26:42.005
and then likewise celebrate like humanity.

504
00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:47.085
Let other people actually see and enter into your joy

505
00:26:47.425 --> 00:26:50.285
and put it on display because it brings God glory

506
00:26:50.745 --> 00:26:52.125
and it honors him for what he does

507
00:26:52.125 --> 00:26:53.965
and it helps other people to see

508
00:26:53.965 --> 00:26:57.245
and behold him, like the old saying goes, the best

509
00:26:57.845 --> 00:27:01.485
advertising is done by satisfied customers.

510
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:07.125
But before we conclude, I, there's sort of a problem, okay?

511
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.325
As I read this and I'm thinking about it,

512
00:27:09.325 --> 00:27:10.925
and maybe this has occurred to you as well

513
00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:12.925
as you're listening to me, maybe not,

514
00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:15.165
but as I, I read through this

515
00:27:15.745 --> 00:27:18.365
and sought to even apply it to my own life

516
00:27:18.425 --> 00:27:20.885
and I'm praying about these things, I thought, wow,

517
00:27:21.205 --> 00:27:22.245
I encounter a word.

518
00:27:22.405 --> 00:27:25.965
A couple of words here that, you know, on at first blush,

519
00:27:26.205 --> 00:27:27.765
I don't quite know to know what to do with.

520
00:27:27.825 --> 00:27:29.765
It says this in verse 10.

521
00:27:30.425 --> 00:27:33.245
Let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord

522
00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:34.845
and take refuge in him.

523
00:27:34.985 --> 00:27:39.605
Let all who are upright in heart exalt.

524
00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:41.925
So I have a question for you.

525
00:27:41.945 --> 00:27:45.605
Do, are these words, righteous and upright?

526
00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:50.325
Are these words that always define you as I read this,

527
00:27:50.325 --> 00:27:52.525
that I know they don't always define me.

528
00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:54.165
And so there's kind of a problem, right?

529
00:27:54.165 --> 00:27:57.325
These are promises to righteous those that are righteous,

530
00:27:57.325 --> 00:27:59.405
those that are upright in heart.

531
00:28:00.025 --> 00:28:02.285
And um, so I guess that's kind of my question.

532
00:28:02.465 --> 00:28:06.765
Are you, are you righteous? Are you upright in heart?

533
00:28:06.765 --> 00:28:08.005
In fact, as we read the Bible,

534
00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:11.085
maybe you've read Romans chapter three, verse 10.

535
00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:14.325
It says, there's actually none that are righteous.

536
00:28:15.105 --> 00:28:18.805
In fact, he emphasizes it by saying, no, not one.

537
00:28:19.705 --> 00:28:22.605
And the claim of anyone to say that I'm upright

538
00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:24.885
and hard is a bit scandalous, I think.

539
00:28:25.305 --> 00:28:27.165
Um, so lemme just say this.

540
00:28:27.225 --> 00:28:30.725
You know, I'm not confused about my audience here. Actually.

541
00:28:30.925 --> 00:28:35.885
I know for a fact that I'm talking to a room full of people

542
00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:39.965
who are broken and sinful and unrighteous,

543
00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:43.205
and my fingers are all pointing back

544
00:28:43.225 --> 00:28:44.445
my direction too, right?

545
00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:48.565
You're looking at an example of one who is unrighteous

546
00:28:49.025 --> 00:28:52.445
and not always upright in heart.

547
00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:54.005
So I'm talking about us,

548
00:28:55.065 --> 00:28:57.005
but I'm specifically talking about you.

549
00:28:58.145 --> 00:29:00.645
Can I get an amen? Amen.

550
00:29:01.715 --> 00:29:05.085
Some of you have been on the receiving end of something like

551
00:29:05.085 --> 00:29:07.405
what David is talking about here, some

552
00:29:07.405 --> 00:29:09.765
of his evil enemies and adversaries.

553
00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:12.805
And you can really relate to Psalm 64.

554
00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:15.845
And frankly, I hope all of us here, if that's you.

555
00:29:16.225 --> 00:29:19.165
The reality is this is meant to comfort and encourage you.

556
00:29:19.165 --> 00:29:20.645
And I pray that that is the result.

557
00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:25.005
But some of you have actually in your life been those

558
00:29:25.235 --> 00:29:26.925
enemies to other people.

559
00:29:28.655 --> 00:29:29.855
I don't know who you are, and I'm

560
00:29:30.055 --> 00:29:31.095
certainly not naming names.

561
00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:33.775
Uh, I know I've done this in my life.

562
00:29:34.255 --> 00:29:37.375
I have been at times an enemy to other people.

563
00:29:38.435 --> 00:29:39.775
You know, there's a way in which all

564
00:29:39.775 --> 00:29:41.055
of us I think can relate to that.

565
00:29:41.665 --> 00:29:43.525
All of us at times are self-serving,

566
00:29:43.905 --> 00:29:46.885
and we have, uh, self selfish ambition

567
00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:50.565
and selfish gain in mind, and we treat people that way.

568
00:29:51.105 --> 00:29:52.965
Um, we weaponize our words.

569
00:29:53.745 --> 00:29:56.685
We spread rumors or lies, we gossip, slander,

570
00:29:57.385 --> 00:30:01.005
malign other people sometimes, whether we mean to or not.

571
00:30:01.025 --> 00:30:04.125
We spoil people's friendships, we interfere with them

572
00:30:04.145 --> 00:30:06.965
and their relationship with, even with God.

573
00:30:09.365 --> 00:30:12.145
We set traps for them. We're jealous and selfish.

574
00:30:12.445 --> 00:30:16.055
And sometimes this happens in our families, right?

575
00:30:16.055 --> 00:30:20.495
Maybe at home, sometimes it happens at, at the office, like

576
00:30:20.495 --> 00:30:22.375
where you work, people you work with,

577
00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:23.535
you've seen it certainly,

578
00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:26.215
but then sometimes we, you're, you're the cause of it.

579
00:30:26.365 --> 00:30:27.495
Perhaps it's at school.

580
00:30:27.515 --> 00:30:29.455
If you're a student in the cafeteria

581
00:30:29.475 --> 00:30:32.615
or in the classroom, wherever it might play out.

582
00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:35.375
I mean, God forbid, I I would assume

583
00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:36.535
it even happens in the church.

584
00:30:37.555 --> 00:30:39.935
In fact, I've been pastoring long enough to know

585
00:30:39.935 --> 00:30:41.575
that it actually does.

586
00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:45.175
So, so I'm not confused about who I'm addressing.

587
00:30:45.495 --> 00:30:48.135
I love you all and just as much as I love myself,

588
00:30:48.475 --> 00:30:51.055
but these are words where we see what God is doing.

589
00:30:51.215 --> 00:30:53.855
I think in a moment like this is holding up a mirror for us

590
00:30:53.855 --> 00:30:56.775
to see ourselves really clearly because all,

591
00:30:56.775 --> 00:30:59.015
because here the reality is we're not the

592
00:30:59.015 --> 00:31:00.175
hero of this story.

593
00:31:00.515 --> 00:31:03.695
You know, even David himself is not the hero of this story.

594
00:31:04.265 --> 00:31:05.975
David is the one who is in need.

595
00:31:06.385 --> 00:31:08.495
David was, there were times when David's life,

596
00:31:08.495 --> 00:31:10.095
when he was the enemy, right?

597
00:31:11.075 --> 00:31:13.815
And so he's calling out to God who can save him

598
00:31:14.355 --> 00:31:15.495
and have mercy on him.

599
00:31:15.595 --> 00:31:20.135
And I think either way, Psalm 64 provides a bit of a rebuke

600
00:31:20.595 --> 00:31:23.655
and a bit of a confrontation to people like us.

601
00:31:24.955 --> 00:31:29.655
And as we look into the mirror of Psalm 64, we see,

602
00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:30.815
we see some of these things.

603
00:31:31.295 --> 00:31:32.495
I what I hear here,

604
00:31:33.275 --> 00:31:37.775
and what I want to extend to all of us here this morning is

605
00:31:37.775 --> 00:31:41.735
that here we encounter a gracious invitation from God

606
00:31:42.165 --> 00:31:45.335
that we would return to him in repentance.

607
00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:47.815
And that that's what I want to invite you

608
00:31:47.815 --> 00:31:49.335
to do this morning.

609
00:31:50.165 --> 00:31:54.295
Because what we've learned here in this chapter is

610
00:31:54.295 --> 00:31:55.295
that God sees,

611
00:31:56.675 --> 00:31:59.775
God hears, God knows.

612
00:32:00.955 --> 00:32:03.895
And when you were that enemy, you didn't get away with it

613
00:32:04.805 --> 00:32:08.015
because God is the one who is the only righteous judge.

614
00:32:08.275 --> 00:32:11.815
And he calls every single one of us to an account.

615
00:32:14.105 --> 00:32:16.245
You need to make that right with God.

616
00:32:16.565 --> 00:32:18.005
Whatever perhaps is coming into your heart

617
00:32:18.005 --> 00:32:20.605
and mind, whether it's a current reality

618
00:32:20.665 --> 00:32:23.725
or a distant memory, you need to make that right with God.

619
00:32:23.785 --> 00:32:25.045
And you may need to go

620
00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:27.445
and make that right with other people.

621
00:32:28.185 --> 00:32:30.685
That's a step we often lack, but that's true.

622
00:32:30.695 --> 00:32:35.125
Repentance is inconveniencing ourself to make it right

623
00:32:35.515 --> 00:32:38.885
with other people as God makes it right with us.

624
00:32:39.465 --> 00:32:43.005
So I would just say as we are in,

625
00:32:43.065 --> 00:32:45.965
as whether you're in the middle of a, of a sin

626
00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:49.005
and a crime like that, or whether it's just a distant memory

627
00:32:49.065 --> 00:32:52.885
or something else, I want you to see and hear

628
00:32:53.465 --> 00:32:58.285
and understand that the gospel message from Psalm 64 says

629
00:32:58.285 --> 00:33:00.165
that there is a hero to this story.

630
00:33:00.505 --> 00:33:03.925
And it is the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only one

631
00:33:04.185 --> 00:33:06.605
who is righteous and upright in heart.

632
00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:09.965
And he suffered at the hands of his enemy on our behalf.

633
00:33:10.305 --> 00:33:13.725
He was talked about, betrayed, lied about, tortured.

634
00:33:13.745 --> 00:33:16.925
And indeed he was ambushed unto the point of death

635
00:33:17.465 --> 00:33:19.645
for you and for me.

636
00:33:19.995 --> 00:33:21.485
Amen. Amen. Yes.

637
00:33:22.185 --> 00:33:24.085
And so this is what we see here,

638
00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:26.325
because it's him who saves you.

639
00:33:26.835 --> 00:33:28.245
It's him who forgives you.

640
00:33:28.475 --> 00:33:30.045
It's him who will rescue you,

641
00:33:30.185 --> 00:33:31.925
and it's Him who will change you.

642
00:33:33.825 --> 00:33:35.845
The Lord takes us where he finds us,

643
00:33:36.175 --> 00:33:37.645
which is good news indeed.

644
00:33:38.065 --> 00:33:40.005
But he doesn't leave us that way.

645
00:33:40.425 --> 00:33:44.085
He loves us too much to leave us the way that we are.

646
00:33:44.085 --> 00:33:45.485
And he wants to change us

647
00:33:46.065 --> 00:33:48.925
and to do so in a way that brings him honor

648
00:33:48.945 --> 00:33:51.365
and glory self as we turn to him

649
00:33:51.425 --> 00:33:54.005
and faith, as we repent of our sins

650
00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:58.525
and we turn away from those things, we turn in faith

651
00:33:58.785 --> 00:34:02.205
to God in trust, and we turn and follow Jesus.

652
00:34:02.465 --> 00:34:07.005
So this is where as we begin

653
00:34:07.005 --> 00:34:08.685
to kinda land the plane on this,

654
00:34:08.685 --> 00:34:10.725
we we're approaching our final point.

655
00:34:11.385 --> 00:34:14.925
Um, God is the hero of this story.

656
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:21.455
If you have or if you will, the invitation is to come

657
00:34:21.515 --> 00:34:24.935
to him, to trust in him, to turn from your sin

658
00:34:24.935 --> 00:34:28.095
and walk in his forgiveness for you.

659
00:34:28.245 --> 00:34:32.495
Come and follow Jesus. God is a gracious and a willing God,

660
00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:35.775
and he is willing and ready to receive every one of us.

661
00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:39.855
So, um, if that doesn't excite you, frankly, I don't know

662
00:34:39.855 --> 00:34:43.135
what will I know it's nine or whatever the time is, okay?

663
00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:46.415
But this is good news and good news indeed.

664
00:34:46.615 --> 00:34:47.775
I just wanna read it again.

665
00:34:48.175 --> 00:34:51.135
'cause verse 10 reflects a dramatic reality.

666
00:34:51.515 --> 00:34:55.575
If this is you, if your righteousness is in Jesus Christ,

667
00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:56.975
then this applies to you.

668
00:34:57.075 --> 00:35:00.815
Let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord

669
00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:02.255
and take refuge in him.

670
00:35:02.595 --> 00:35:06.335
Let all the upright and heart exalt in him.

671
00:35:07.235 --> 00:35:11.575
And because we move from fear to faith, when we find

672
00:35:11.575 --> 00:35:13.575
that God thrills, fills

673
00:35:14.115 --> 00:35:18.615
and changes us, we believe that God delights you,

674
00:35:19.275 --> 00:35:21.095
is what we see here in this verse.

675
00:35:21.155 --> 00:35:22.815
So in the face of enemies, foes,

676
00:35:22.815 --> 00:35:27.175
and fears, Psalm 64 assures us that we are heard, hid,

677
00:35:27.255 --> 00:35:30.975
defended and delighted as we take refuge in God.

678
00:35:31.315 --> 00:35:34.535
And here we begin to land the plane. This is my conclusion.

679
00:35:34.635 --> 00:35:35.895
We move from fear to faith.

680
00:35:36.115 --> 00:35:37.605
If you're following in the outline,

681
00:35:37.785 --> 00:35:40.845
number five point number five is we do so.

682
00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:43.525
When we believe that it is not about you,

683
00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:46.725
it is ultimately all about God.

684
00:35:47.275 --> 00:35:49.965
Just listen to the course of this chapter.

685
00:35:50.985 --> 00:35:54.245
God hears, God hides,

686
00:35:55.705 --> 00:35:58.005
God defends, God delights,

687
00:35:58.265 --> 00:36:01.005
and God deserves all of the glory.

688
00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.685
We just get all the benefits.

689
00:36:03.935 --> 00:36:06.965
Verse nine, fear God and tell others what he has done

690
00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:08.805
and let it change the way you think and live.

691
00:36:08.855 --> 00:36:11.405
Verse 10, rejoice in the Lord and hide in him.

692
00:36:12.105 --> 00:36:15.605
And then celebrate like you mean it in repentance

693
00:36:15.605 --> 00:36:18.885
and faith in a way that others can see and benefit from.

694
00:36:18.885 --> 00:36:22.325
Learn to pray from Psalm 64 and look to God

695
00:36:22.325 --> 00:36:24.485
and faith as you do in the end.

696
00:36:24.775 --> 00:36:26.925
Don't leave here today without letting God

697
00:36:27.325 --> 00:36:29.045
confront and comfort you.

698
00:36:29.475 --> 00:36:33.965
With these words, we hear God's sorry, we hear the voice

699
00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:37.565
of fear, but God hears our voice in prayer

700
00:36:37.665 --> 00:36:41.085
and we move from faith, sorry, from fear to faith

701
00:36:41.955 --> 00:36:44.325
when we take refuge in him.
