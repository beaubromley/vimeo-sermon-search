00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.300
Well, good evening church. So glad you guys are here

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.400
tonight. We get a special evening tonight.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.200
It's a little bit out of the ordinary we get

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.100
to ordain some deacons and you're going to get to hear

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.900
a little bit here in just a bit. Just what these men have

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.100
gone through over the last 12 months

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.800
last year. This is a long rigorous process

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.300
of

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.400
Basically, just getting the torture them for a whole year. So we're

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.700
excited to get to hear from them and

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.200
see what God is doing in their lives what he's already

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.700
used them for and then what he's continuing to do through

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.300
their lives and the deacons are a big part of what we

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.800
do here at Henderson Hills and part of

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.100
God's plan for the local church. So you'll get to

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.700
hear about that this evening as well.

17
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
But before we get into that, we're

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.700
going to take a little bit of time to sing some songs together and worship.

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.000
And before we begin, let me go

20
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.700
ahead and pray for us.

21
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.400
Father we are so grateful that we get to be here

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.600
in this room tonight getting to to worship

23
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600
you getting to see your plan

24
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.500
for the church and action here at

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.600
Henderson Hills. But God more

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.300
than just being focused on what we're doing here locally. We

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.600
want to give you glory and honor for who

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
you are and how you have stepped into creation and

29
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.800
we get to remember that during this Christmas season. I'm

30
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.400
focus on what you've

31
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.100
accomplished here on Earth when you

32
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.400
came some 2,000 years ago.

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
But what's the accomplish them, but you're still going to accomplish in the future

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.400
what you're doing in seouls tonight what you're

35
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.500
going to do in seouls tomorrow and 100 years from

36
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
now and into eternity and saving us and

37
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.400
redeeming us from the sin that

38
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.300
we were trapped in God. We

39
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.700
love you. We thank you for your faithfulness and your

40
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.500
goodness to us.

41
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
That's in your son's name. We pray. Amen. Well you go ahead and

42
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.700
stand with us as we get racing tonight.

43
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.200
Great Is Thy Faithfulness?

44
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.400

Father we do praise you tonight. We bring you glory.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.000
Tonight although we get to celebrate what

131
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.100
you're doing in the lives of these these men

132
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.300

son without Jesus and it

137
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.600

amen

142
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.500
Good evening.

143
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.400
Glad that you're all are here. It's my pleasure and

144
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.000
privilege to.

145
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.500
share a few words this evening and in honor of

146
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:22.700
our

147
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.500
Brothers that are coming to be ordained tonight Beau Brumley,

148
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.100
I'm Brad kesanki and Steve Stoltz. So

149
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.100
we're thankful that you could be here and my job

150
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.900
I guess is to talk a little bit about the qualifications

151
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.500
for the Deacon's and the process that

152
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.400
we follow and I want to thank Chris and Randy both deacons for

153
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.900
leading this in worship this evening.

154
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.600
So I'm also supposed to talk about what a deacon does and

155
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.500
before I start I was thinking about when

156
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.200
I first heard about Deacons.

157
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.900
I remember that in house where I grew up.

158
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.200
In Oklahoma City, we had a

159
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.800
piece of furniture.

160
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.700
In the front room.

161
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.300
And my mom called that the deacons bench.

162
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.900
so I asked her we're one time when I was a

163
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.200
Young lad why is it called the

164
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.200
deacons bench and she told me that it was the type of

165
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.100
beans that deacons of the church would sit on normally at

166
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.800
the back of the church.

167
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.200
So they could keep an eye on the congregation.

168
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.800
And make sure they were not misbehaving or sleeping.

169
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.700
And during the church service and and I

170
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.100
didn't start really going regularly to church until I was in the

171
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.600
seventh grade and started going to church at the

172
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.200
Baptist Temple down in Oklahoma City 30th and

173
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.600
Villa.

174
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.100
and so I started going to that church from the youth group there and

175
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.100
and I asked who were the men that were out in the

176
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.500
parking lot.

177
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.900
Walking around and some of them were smoking.

178
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.900
And I was told that those were the deacons of the church.

179
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.100
And they were on vigilante Patrol to make

180
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.500
sure the parking lot was safe.

181
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.200
So at that point in time I remembered now, maybe

182
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.400
that's a pretty good job. I might want to have some time walking around

183
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.500
in the parking lot not smoking but making

184
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.000
sure everything was safe.

185
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.700
So that's really my first recollection of deacons and

186
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.300
later on. I served as a deacon at

187
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.200
the Baptist Temple Church and First Baptist Edmund and

188
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.600
also here at Henderson Hills.

189
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.800
And I was trying to guess.

190
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.300
All total. I think I served as a deacon for over 35 years

191
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.700
before becoming an elder.

192
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.600
here at in August of 2021

193
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.300
I also remember I was in Charleston South Carolina

194
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.400
a long time ago on a trip and

195
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.900
I went to a church service in a Baptist Church in downtown

196
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.600
Charleston.

197
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.600
And for those of you been there's a lot of history there. And

198
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.200
so I think the church was founded in the

199
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.000
1700s.

200
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.100
And they were saying these stools at the back of

201
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.700
the sanctuary.

202
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.500
And in colonial times as I understand it the deacons would

203
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.500
sit on these stools.

204
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.200
And there were these long poles.

205
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.300
And they could use these poles to poke someone if

206
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.700
they fell asleep during the sermon.

207
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.200
So we don't do that today. We don't have any.

208
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.000
Stools or poles or benches at the back and we

209
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.400
don't poke you if you fall asleep because no

210
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.800
one would ever fall asleep during the message but deacons

211
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.500
are really not.

212
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.400
The the pokers or

213
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.500
the hitters. They are the the servant

214
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.800
Ministers of the church.

215
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.200
And so we're thankful for that and we're thankful tonight to to

216
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.600
honor these men into designate and

217
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.500
and set them apart for their calling.

218
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.400
so

219
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.500
Acts chapter 6

220
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.400
beginning in verse 1 now in these days when the

221
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.800
disciples were increasing in number a complaint by the hellenists arose

222
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.200
against the Hebrews because their widows

223
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.400
were being neglected in the daily distribution.

224
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.400
And the twelve some and the full number the disciples and said

225
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.500
it is not right that we should give out preaching the word of God to serve

226
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.000
tables.

227
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.400
Therefore Brothers pick out from among you seven

228
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.700
men of good repute.

229
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.000
Follow the spirit and of wisdom whom we will

230
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.000
point to this Duty.

231
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.700
But we will devote ourselves to prayer.

232
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.500
and to the ministry of the word

233
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.200
And what they said please the whole Gathering and they

234
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.100
chose Stephen A Man full of faith and the Holy Spirit Philip kuris

235
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.500
and the canore and time

236
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.300
and parminus and Nicholas prostate of

237
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:45.800
Antioch.

238
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.900
There's these they set before the apostles.

239
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.000
And they prayed and laid their hands on them.

240
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.300
And the word of God continued to increase and the

241
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.600
number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem and a

242
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.200
great many of the priests became obedient.

243
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.300
to the faith

244
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.500
There are two offices of the church. I mentioned

245
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.500
in the Bible the first of these is that of overseer or

246
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.600
Elder. The second is the decent Deacon or

247
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.000
servant.

248
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.800
God calls the individual to either office and the

249
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.400
individuals recognized with great honor and this in

250
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:18.500
the church.

251
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.200
And is acceptance of the calling deacons are recognized

252
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.500
by their peers as humble servants and Ministers of

253
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.800
Mercy long before they're invited into the office of

254
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.300
deacon.

255
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.400
This demonstrates a commitment to the hard work of helping God's

256
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.800
people over time.

257
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.700
And I know each of the three men tonight and they've

258
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.300
been deaconing for a long time and we're

259
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.800
thankful for that and for their service.

260
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.400
It is Henderson Hills believed that both elders

261
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.100
and deacons are biblical designated as officers of the local

262
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.300
church.

263
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.300
Our ordination does not extend to other churches when an elder

264
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.300
Deacon moves to that church nor does an elder or Deacon from another church

265
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.400
who comes to our church automatically become an elder

266
00:15:59.400 --> 00:15:59.900
or deacon.

267
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.500
In all cases Henderson Hills obeys the

268
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.800
biblical principle of absolutely affirming one's qualifications.

269
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.400
for the office

270
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.200
and let them also be tested first and then

271
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.000
let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.

272
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.300
The scripture I read act six and

273
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.200
then the Philippians 1:1 says Paul and

274
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.100
Timothy Servants of Christ. Jesus to all the

275
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.500
saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi with the

276
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.000
overseers and deacons. So that's the first New Testament

277
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.700
reference to the yacht in it.

278
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.500
In first 10:3-13. It talks

279
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.900
about I mentions the deacons rewards

280
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.700
for those who have served. Well as deacons attained

281
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.700
for themselves a high standing and great confidence

282
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.600
in the faith. That is in Christ Jesus.

283
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.700
Hebrews 13:17 says obey your

284
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.800
leaders and submit to them.

285
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.500
For they keep watching over your souls.

286
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.300
As those who will have to give an account.

287
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.100
As those who will have to give an account.

288
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.300
Let them do this with joy and not with groaning for that would

289
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.300
be of no advantage to you.

290
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.800
A deacon is a biblically qualified servant officer

291
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.200
who is called by God and led by

292
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.800
elders.

293
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.200
Though deacons are subordinate Elders there to be

294
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.800
elevated even exalted within the church body Elders must

295
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.100
be careful to lead to deacons with Excellence communicating clearly

296
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.000
and frequently to avoid misunderstandings and

297
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.200
clarifying goals and responsibilities deacons should

298
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.500
be free to do the hard work of directing directly touching

299
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.800
people's lives elders and deacons must work together and

300
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.600
lead by example continually fostering

301
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.500
an atmosphere of love with trust and respect for each

302
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:52.600
other.

303
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.300
Deacons are the servant Ministers of the church as I said and they

304
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.300
have the honor of modeling for the local church and the Lost World.

305
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.200
God's compassion and kindness and mercy and love

306
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.600
as a church compassionately cares for people's needs the world sees a

307
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.200
visible display of Christ's love in each of these men.

308
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.700
Which will draw people to the savior?

309
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.100
Deacons are to be an example of commitment and unity and

310
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.200
Harmony in their service.

311
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.600
The deacons are to effectively and carefully administer the church's charitable

312
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.500
activities their agents of mercy and Distributors

313
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.500
of relief. They help the poor the jobless the

314
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.500
sick the widowed the elderly the homeless the shut-in and

315
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.000
the disabled.

316
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.500
They Comfort protect and encourage people and help

317
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.200
to meet their needs.

318
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.800
qualifications of a deacon

319
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.400
in first Timothy chapter 3 beginning in verse 8 deacons

320
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.900
likewise must be men of dignity not

321
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.300
double tongue or addicted to much wine or

322
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.800
found a sorted gang.

323
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.100
But holding to the mystery of the Faith with a clear conscience.

324
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.500
These men must also first be tested then let

325
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.200
them serve as deacons if they are Beyond.

326
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.800
reproach

327
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.300
deacons must be husbands of only one wife and good

328
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.200
managers with their children and their own household for those

329
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.400
who have served. Well as deacons obtained for themselves a high

330
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.000
standing and great confidence in the faith.

331
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.200
That is in Christ Jesus.

332
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.800
I've talked a little bit about the qualifications man

333
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.600
of dignity not double tongue.

334
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.300
Not addicted to much wine free from the love of many not

335
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.500
fond of sort of gain.

336
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.500
Holding to the mystery of the Faith with clear conscience. Let these

337
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.800
also first be tested.

338
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.300
you know, honestly I said earlier that

339
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.700
I had privilege of

340
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.500
serving as a deacon in other churches.

341
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.900
And the testing process that I

342
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.300
underwented at the other churches in

343
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.300
which I served in is quite different from the one that we've had at

344
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.300
Henderson Hills for many years.

345
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.400
For we spend nearly a year with each

346
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.900
of these men.

347
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.600
Not only do we

348
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.400
pray with them and discuss with them and hear

349
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.100
their testimony.

350
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.300
But we sit down and we go over some

351
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.000
material that talks about what it means to be a

352
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.600
deacon.

353
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.400
and

354
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.100
then they get to have a mentor a

355
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.300
deacon who's who goes with them through the process?

356
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.600
we also then give them 40 questions

357
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.100
theological questions that we give them

358
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.100
most of the summer to

359
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.200
to go through and to write answers and then they

360
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.400
turn those in and then we talk to them about their answers and tell

361
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.900
them that they were wrong and try again and but now

362
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.900
we don't do that, but we do encourage them and visit

363
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.200
with them and so the process

364
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.500
That I went through at Henderson Hills and the process that these

365
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.200
men tonight went through is extensive.

366
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.400
And we believe they've been tested well.

367
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.600
And we are as a deacon coordination team.

368
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.300
That's we don't really have Deacon officers,

369
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.500
but we have a coordination team that functions as

370
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.300
officers and they serve as the

371
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.600
leadership team of the deacon body.

372
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.900
The DC team DCT as we

373
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.800
call it is responsible for the overall direction and

374
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.400
coordination of all Deacon Ministries and is the

375
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.800
primary point of contact between the Deacon body.

376
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.900
And right now I have about 83 Deacons.

377
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.200
The Elder Council and the Pastoral staff

378
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.400
one of our Elder serves as a deacon facilitator

379
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.300
and that's TR Lewis. He couldn't be here tonight. Then there

380
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.800
are other Elders that serve I serve on the DCT and

381
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.600
Mark Wood before he went on sabbatical was

382
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.600
also an elder member of the DCT we have

383
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.200
Trevor Nall

384
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.800
and Rob Garrett and Chris Cross who have

385
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.000
served on the DCT this year and Rob

386
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.800
were kicking off and no

387
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.800
you're rotating off and we'll in

388
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.300
2023 Phillip. Slope will

389
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.200
be joining us on the DC team. We're glad to have you Phillip. So

390
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.400
thank you for winning one to serve and thank you rob saying all seriousness.

391
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.800
You made a great deal of difference in our DC team the past

392
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.400
couple of years that you served and we appreciate you.

393
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:22.900
So we

394
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.100
the Deacon facilitator and the Deacon team we get together.

395
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.200
We we met first with our Deacon candidates.

396
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.600
We asked them if they might be interested. We are we first

397
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.900
of all during the first part of the year. We let our

398
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.200
church body know that we'll be

399
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.200
accepting nominations or persons that want

400
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.300
to submit somebody's name. And then we review those names

401
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.500
review those with the church staff and with the elders. We also

402
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.600
then contact the persons

403
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.300
and ask them if they might be interested. The whole process is

404
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.500
meant to be and very confidential because of

405
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.100
any one point in time. It may be that a person

406
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.500
might want to step out of the process. So as I mentioned we do

407
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.000
a schedule we do a study and have classes

408
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.300
and additional interviews. We have the opportunity

409
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.900
to meet with their spouse and make sure

410
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.900
that everyone kind of knows what we're talking about here and

411
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.400
we talked about the 40 questions and then

412
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.100
we do a final interview and then if everyone is still on

413
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.400
the same page and wants to proceed they recommended the elders

414
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.000
and then ultimately the church

415
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.300
Will vote on them and and then

416
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.600
we were here tonight about and that's

417
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.700
the process that we follow.

418
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:36.800
so

419
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.900
every time the Deacon body meets we remind ourselves of

420
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.400
our calling and our responsibilities.

421
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.600
We continue to read these scriptures over and

422
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.300
over and over again, and we

423
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.800
continue to remind ourselves how important

424
00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.000
our job is some principles

425
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.400
that we have identified is that as deacons. We

426
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.100
have been called qualified and equipped by God for the work of

427
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.700
his church.

428
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.200
We are accountable to God to the elders to each other

429
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.800
into the congregation for our words and our actions as Church

430
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.600
officers. We expected to be role models of Christian character

431
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.000
and living.

432
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.300
Man of dignity and integrity truthful trustworthy

433
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.300
sober-minded faithful and marriage

434
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.200
and leading our family. We assist the elders with

435
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.100
their pastoral care of the congregants enabling the elders to focus on

436
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.400
their god-given responsibilities of leading feeding and protecting

437
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:31.900
the church.

438
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.300
As deacons we serve with the attitude of Christ humbly lovingly

439
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.800
sacrificially and joyfully and

440
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.000
those who serve well gain a good standing for the

441
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.200
cells and a great confidence in the faith.

442
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.000
Me a little bit of word about that humbly.

443
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.300
We have deacons have all been provided

444
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.200
with a name tag that has their name in

445
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.300
the word deaconundrea.

446
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.500
And we have always encouraged the deacons to wear those and it's

447
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.500
like pulling teeth to get a deacon

448
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.700
to where a name tag because why because they

449
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.100
don't want to stand out. They they want

450
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.300
to work they want to do what God has called

451
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.700
them to do, but they're not they don't do it for recognition.

452
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.300
and so we keep working on that and

453
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.800
I don't wear my name didn't wear my name tag either but

454
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.200
What is a deacon do well we look after the

455
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.200
widows and widowers of our church, which is one of the greatest

456
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.800
blessings that each one of us have.

457
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.100
To be assigned a widow or widow or one or

458
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.100
two to check on them on a regular basis to see what we can do

459
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.200
to to walk aside walk side by

460
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.400
side with them and which is a very difficult time often.

461
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.400
Many of our widows and widowers do not have family nearby or

462
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.400
may not have family and so the importance of

463
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.200
looking after them and seeing how that we

464
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.200
could assist them Deacon's wise work hand in hand

465
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.400
and help us in those very important tasks. And

466
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.700
we also have the opportunity to in many

467
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.500
occasions to go to hospitals and visit with folks and check

468
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.400
on folks and see how they were doing encouraged them

469
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.100
to pray with them and then there's Ministries to

470
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.500
the homebound Ministries to nursing homes. There's Ministries

471
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.400
to Children of single parents and those who

472
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.800
do not have parents we a big

473
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.200
responsibility. We have a team of deacons who look after our

474
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.400
benevolence Ministry and people who come to

475
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.200
our church and need help financially. And so

476
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.700
we that's a deacon responsibility dealing with financial counseling

477
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.200
or help some Ministry. A lot of folks need some help with things around

478
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.300
their house. And so that happens through our Deacon team

479
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.800
Lord's supper and baptism and greeters.

480
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.900
Those things are also coordinated with the

481
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.300
leadership of our Deacon body.

482
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.300
so Deacons

483
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.400
are to spot and

484
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.500
meet tangible needs when they see them.

485
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.700
They're to protect and promote Church Unity.

486
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.800
There to serve and support the elders.

487
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.500
But I will say that.

488
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.900
Deaconing is not for the faint of heart.

489
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.400
It is a high calling.

490
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.700
It is a privilege.

491
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.300
It is an honor to serve those.

492
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.500
I can think back to the widows. I

493
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.500
have been blessed to serve.

494
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.300
And I can tell you that they bless me more than I ever blessed

495
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.600
them.

496
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.000
And so

497
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.700
Steve Brad and Beau

498
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.200
beginning does not for the faint of heart, but I know you're up to

499
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.700
it and I look forward to serving with you.

500
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.400
So they're deacons and Elders in the audience that will look

501
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.300
forward to serving with you.

502
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.100
So God bless you men and your families.

503
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.400
And let me pray quickly heavenly father. Thank you for our time

504
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:51.800
tonight.

505
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.700
And as we learn more about these men now I pray that

506
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.600
you will guide them that you will strengthen them that you

507
00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.700
will continue to give them wisdom.

508
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.500
And thank you for their service to our church.

509
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.300
Thank you for their families who support them and stand it's

510
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.900
stand right by their side.

511
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.900
Before we pray these things in your name and for your sake. Amen.

512
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.800
All right, if you three men will come join me up here on

513
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.200
stage.

514
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.300
They look very reluctant.

515
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.600
Said anywhere you want.

516
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.400
You know when Steve was talking about?

517
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:56.800
the

518
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.000
Elder sin in the back watch him. Make sure people don't sleep. I thought

519
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.200
man. That sounds like a pretty good job.

520
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.200
and then I realized I'm usually the one sleeping during the service

521
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.600
so I probably wouldn't do very well at that but

522
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.200
Church, this is a this really is a fun night for us

523
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.300
as the DCT and for these men and their families as as we

524
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.100
finish up this process, you know,

525
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.700
we've got to spend the better part of the last year. Just getting

526
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.400
to know these man walk through the process with them and it really

527
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.100
has been a great joy to do that. But we

528
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.900
just we wanted to you to get to hear a little bit from them

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.400
When we move to Edmond, I

546
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.100
was born and raised in Lone Wolf, Oklahoma.

547
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.700
Maybe a few of you have heard of it.

548
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.800
My sisters are here tonight as well with their family and my mother-in-law father-in-law.

549
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.100
My sister's go to church here as well.

550
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.900
So that makes three of us and also know one other.

551
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.400
Lone Wolf graduate that goes to school Henderson Hill,

552
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.600
so I think we're representing pretty well for a town of 400 people.

553
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.700
So

554
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.100
Let's see. He said what I do for a living, I work in

555
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.400
the John Deere business manage the parts and service

556
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.100
operations for pancake equipment. Where a John

557
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:04.200
Deere.

558
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.700
Farm and lawn and garden equipment in Oklahoma and Arkansas. So

559
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.400
that's what I've done. I've been in the John Deere business ever since

560
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.100
I got out of college.

561
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.900
At Oklahoma State. Thank you.

562
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.900
Anybody that's not Brad's family ever heard of loan.

563
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.300
Lone Wolf. Wow, that's a

564
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.500
lot. Okay.

565
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.400
Bo

566
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.500
hi, my name is Bo Bromley.

567
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.700
My wife is Kristen. We got

568
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.900
married in 2013. So that's

569
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.500
Nine years ago.

570
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.200
We grew up in Tulsa.

571
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.200
And we got married just out

572
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.500
of college. So we graduate I graduated from OSU in 2013 moved

573
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.800
to Edmond and got married

574
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.400
just two months later and came to Henderson

575
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.300
and those following months. I think one of the biggest things that Drew us

576
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.500
here is at the time it felt like it was a big church,

577
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.500
but it broke down into Community

578
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.600
really well and I think that Community like sucked Us

579
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.400
in and we felt like we were plugged in immediately. We

580
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.100
we started getting active in different Ministries.

581
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.700
So I think that was one of the things that really

582
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.300
Drew us here and that was that was 2013. Yeah. So

583
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.100
right at the same nine years

584
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.300
And we have three kids. We have

585
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.700
Porter who's six?

586
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.600
He just started kindergarten this year and then we have Kaya who's

587
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.600
three and a half?

588
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.700
And Rhett who's 18 months one and

589
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:35.700
a half.

590
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.300
What else what are you I'm an

591
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.900
engineer in oil and gas. So it's it's been a

592
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.400
wild ride. I've been a Devon since since the

593
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.400
graduated again. So it's we've seen some UPS. We've seen a lot

594
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.500
of dance. We're back up. That's great. Yeah,

595
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.400
and my wife has had the opportunity to teach

596
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.600
Porter and Kaya in CLC, and

597
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.000
I can tell you

598
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.300
She loves them. I think that's because of their mother, but she

599
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.300
does love them. So.

600
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.100
Good evening. My name is Steve Stoltz.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.300
from Texas been here since

614
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.100
so I was a I've retired

615
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.600
at the end of 2020. It was a management employee

616
00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.100
with Transportation Company

617
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.900
ups for 40 years and number

618
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.600
of different things mostly operations

619
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.500
type management and then in the engineering

620
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.700
department for about 10 years.

621
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:10.900
so

622
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.800
Enjoyed been here at Henderson House. Roughly. I

623
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.300
don't know look at my wife 20 years

624
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.500
18.

625
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.000
Oh, well something like that have enjoyed

626
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:29.200
serving here. And a number of capacities have

627
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.100
always been generally active

628
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.800
in church and many different ways. So happy to

629
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.400
be here. I appreciate that and and math is

630
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.200
not a qualification to be a deacon. So we

631
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.400
have some issues up here with that. But Steve, let's

632
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.400
start with you since you already have the microphone and you

633
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.300
just give us kind of just a short version of

634
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.300
your testimony. And and when

635
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.700
I say sure just keep it less than an hour and and then

636
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.200
maybe talk about where you're currently serving.

637
00:34:59.500 --> 00:34:59.700
Sure.

638
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.200
Different than well. I say different way, but I grew

639
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.800
up in a Christian home. My parents

640
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.500
were both Christians. And so

641
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.400
we were in church from

642
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.600
Early age birth, you know and I was

643
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.800
at least my and my two sisters so grew

644
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.400
up in church.

645
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.200
unlike many individuals who

646
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.400
have different testimonies in that regard.

647
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.500
Came to know the Lord at

648
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.300
the age of nine and so and pretty

649
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.500
much been in in the church ever since love the

650
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:41.600
church.

651
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.600
Haven't been straight away and brought

652
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.600
and come back and those type things there's many testimonies of

653
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.900
individuals who?

654
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.000
Go through some hard times and difficult times and become Believers

655
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.200
and in the Lord's miraculously changes

656
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.100
their lives and that's not

657
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.200
my story. My story is I've been in

658
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.200
church most of my life, but the one thing that I remember

659
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.900
being in Nicaragua and hearing a

660
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.200
similar testimony of a man that was on the trip with us

661
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:15.300
and

662
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.300
Difficult times he'd gone through and different things and came to the

663
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.300
Lord in his life turned around. It's marriage strengthened and so on and so

664
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.900
forth and those are incredible testimonies, but at the

665
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.100
same time, I think the Lord for those

666
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.500
who

667
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.400
Haven't been through those difficult times but yet

668
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.300
still have that Saving Grace because we

669
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.400
all need forgiveness of sins and and I'm

670
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.700
a sinner and and have that forgiveness. And

671
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.600
so therefore a child of the king and grateful for

672
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.100
that those other thing currently serving

673
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.300
have served

674
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.400
in the cafe for a number of years not currently there

675
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.600
but most recently joined back

676
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.900
with as the choir has kind of

677
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.200
because become a part of some Services

678
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.400
again, enjoy leading in Worship in

679
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.800
whatever way whatever capacity that I

680
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.300
have the opportunity to do and I love to sing. I

681
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.600
love music. I Loved lyrics

682
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.700
and thankful for a church who emphasizes the

683
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.500
words of music and not just Rhythm and eat

684
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.900
and and sound and different things so currently loving

685
00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.400
the opportunity to lead in

686
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.700
Worship in those opportunities in those ways.

687
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.900
Thank you bow.

688
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.200
Um, yeah, so like like Steve I was born and raised to

689
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.100
a Christian family. My parents are here. I'm appreciative. They

690
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.500
I remember going to church forever my

691
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.700
whole life it I remember being a second home

692
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.500
to me it

693
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.500
Every opportunity we had I felt like we were there

694
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.200
through through being at

695
00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.800
church all the time. I remember constantly hearing the gospel through Sunday

696
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.600
school and and constantly

697
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.300
through sitting in big church. Just just

698
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.500
hearing the gospel over and over and over and it first

699
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.900
hit me hard whenever I was eight years old.

700
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.300
And that's when I that's when it came to Faith and then

701
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.700
as I've as I've matured

702
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.100
like that process of just hearing the gospel over and over

703
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.400
and how you continue to hit me and hit me and change my life has continued

704
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.700
to happen and I feel like there have

705
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.400
been times whenever I've pursued God hard and

706
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.300
he is he has changed me in this times and there have

707
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.300
been times whenever I feel like I haven't pursued God is

708
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.200
hard and I still look back on those times and God is still changing me

709
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.400
then and has continued to

710
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.700
sanctify me throughout throughout life. But that repetition of

711
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.600
the Gospel is always come back constantly in

712
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.400
my life. So I felt that so that's just a

713
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.900
bit of my story.

714
00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.100
As far as the Ministries that I've been

715
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.700
in we Chris and I have been plugged in and several

716
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.400
since we've been members here. We started

717
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.200
off in the college Ministry.

718
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.200
And we were there for I don't know a couple years this times

719
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.900
man. They get blurry real quick. Don't they?

720
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.300
The college Ministry for a couple years. We spent some time in Hillside kids with

721
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:20.200
young ones like one or two year olds currently our

722
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.600
serving the high school Ministry.

723
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.600
This is our fourth year there we started with the

724
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.400
current senior class for freshmen

725
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.400
and we've kind of got to step up with them each year. So it's

726
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.800
it's really been a privilege for us to to

727
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.000
start off investing in kids and watching

728
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.300
them mature being able to invest in them.

729
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.100
I feel like it takes several months just to to Break Down The

730
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.200
Walls and get to know them and then ever since

731
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.700
that point we've just like Stuck Like Glue and and now

732
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.400
as they've gone on we've continued to be able to pour into

733
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.300
the lives. I try to share our life as an

734
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.600
example to them end up learning a whole lot from them

735
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.300
in the process and I feel like

736
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.200
at the end of it here. We we end up with just having a

737
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.500
bunch of really close family friends and getting to know them well

738
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.300
and their families. Well, it's it's really been

739
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.000
a blessing to us.

740
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.800
All right. Well, I as well, I was born into Christian

741
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.400
Home blessed to have parents

742
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:20.800
that were.

743
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.600
Strong believers they have both passed away

744
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.100
or both with the Lord now, but we're no

745
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.400
doubt.

746
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.400
credible influence on my life

747
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.200
and in addition to that grew up in a really small

748
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.600
church, but it was a really sound Bible teaching

749
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.200
church was blessed to have grown up

750
00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.500
in that kind of environment where

751
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.800
even in that small church or a lot of people p***

752
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.400
truth in my life and

753
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.400
when I was 13, it became clear to me that

754
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.600
I was a sinner and I

755
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.500
needed forgiveness and gave my

756
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.800
life to Christ and trusted him as my savior was baptized

757
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.000
in that church and

758
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.900
Like I said, I feel like my testimony. My life

759
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.700
is kind of a testimony of God. Just continuing

760
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.200
to pursue me.

761
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.000
and bringing people into my life that have

762
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.500
helped me grow closer in my relationship with the

763
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.700
Lord certainly bringing.

764
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.300
A Godly young woman into my life that became my wife.

765
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.100
She's been a huge influence on me.

766
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.700
As well as many other people.

767
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.200
and we've been blessed in our marriage with our

768
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.600
family and a lot of ways and we've

769
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.700
had some hard times too, but

770
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.300
Through the Lord's sanctifying process

771
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.400
those hard times. I think I've drawn me into a closer relationship

772
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.900
and just deepen my faith. And and that's

773
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.900
also something I think I took from my parents to

774
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.500
just trust in.

775
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.300
The sovereignty of God and I've kind of seen that play out

776
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.400
in my life and that's come back to me as I've gotten older those lessons

777
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.100
that I learned from them.

778
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.300
And so

779
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.100
thankful for that for sure. And as far as

780
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.200
where I'm serving for the last several years have been

781
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.700
serving here at Henderson Hills and Middle School Ministry.

782
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.300
I think this is my sixth year teaching Middle School boys

783
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.200
some leading co-leading in 8th

784
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.700
grade boys group right now with Adrian savedra

785
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:35.900
and

786
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.300
You know, I didn't think that that's something that I

787
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:40.900
would be called to.

788
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.700
But man, it's been a huge blessing to me.

789
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.800
I Love Leading Middle School boys

790
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.600
It's just such a amazing age

791
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.500
and you see the development from you know,

792
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.100
sixth grade seventh grade eighth grade. There's a

793
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.100
lot of physical development for sure, but just

794
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.500
a tremendous amount of Spiritual Development that's

795
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.800
happening during those three years and

796
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.100
Kind of come into the understanding of what it means to not just

797
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.400
know about Jesus but to know Jesus never relationship with Jesus and

798
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.400
being able to play some kind of a small part in

799
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.000
that has been a blessing to me. It's strengthened my faith and

800
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.100
being blessed to be

801
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.100
able to lead them. So yeah, that's kind of where I've been

802
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.800
serving and currently serving.

803
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.200
Praise God. Yeah, I

804
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.400
I think many of us in here and me especially I've

805
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.300
seen you all the way you serve and it's

806
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.400
certainly a blessing to to me and

807
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.700
into the church body. So we

808
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.700
thank you all for that.

809
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:47.800
Brad let me ask you.

810
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.500
What is your favorite book

811
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:51.900
of the Bible?

812
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.300
Love Romans, I would

813
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.100
probably I would probably go with Ephesians.

814
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.800
love Ephesians 2 1 through 10 and just

815
00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.400
clear picture of just the Redemptive work

816
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:10.600
of

817
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.200
Jesus Christ Our Lives, so that's probably

818
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.100
that's probably floats to the top for me.

819
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.200
Yeah, excellent.

820
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.400
Alright bow, we have a different question for you.

821
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.000
How does the way that deacons

822
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.800
serve the church make an impact in people's

823
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.600
spiritual lives?

824
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.600
Yeah, I think I think that's it. That's a good question. I think a

825
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.800
lot of that is really like the main function of of

826
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.000
deacons and what Steve talked about

827
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.000
tonight it to me. It starts a lot

828
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.600
with the work of the Elders of the church shepherding the church well, and

829
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.300
then the the Deacon come alongside and

830
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:55.700
assist them in carrying that out and serving the church that it

831
00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.300
looks a lot of different ways. It looks like caring for the

832
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.300
widows and and the widowers and

833
00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.400
it looks like a lot of behind the scenes things

834
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.600
and a lot of ways. It's the the hands

835
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.900
and the feet behind protecting the church serving the

836
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.900
church loving the church and I kind

837
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.000
of like to look at it as

838
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.400
Um following Christ's command. It's viewing

839
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.100
the church as the bride of Christ and and caring for

840
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.000
it. Well, so it really takes a lot of

841
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.500
a lot of faces, but it's carrying out the Ministries set to

842
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.600
care and protect the church.

843
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:33.800
It's great.

844
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.100
And Steve, where do you see the the

845
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.500
unique passions in

846
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.400
giftings that God has given

847
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.500
you where do you see those adding elements to

848
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.700
our Church's Ministry?

849
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.900
to our white Minister our Church's Ministry

850
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.500
much of kind of what boo had

851
00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.400
mentioned. I've always been one who kind

852
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.200
of works behind the scenes

853
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.500
don't like, you know, most you're going to see out of me is leading in

854
00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.900
worship to acquire but have always been willing to

855
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.800
serve behind the scenes and helping ways

856
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.000
that are tangible whether it's

857
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.000
families or

858
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.800
single people in our church had

859
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.600
just supporting the church body in that way and and

860
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.400
Meeting the needs of those people as best

861
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.300
we can I know I've served alongside didn't even

862
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:35.500
know.

863
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.200
years ago that there were different

864
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.200
groups of Deacon helps team and different things

865
00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.500
and I just get involved with some men and go with them

866
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.800
and help, you know, when we had ice storms and cut tons

867
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.200
of trees off of houses and out of yards

868
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.400
and carried them away and things of that nature and just serving ladies come

869
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.200
to find out widows and different people is who

870
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.300
we were serving and I was serving right alongside her being drawn in

871
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:06.400
by some of you deacons and knew that

872
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.200
I had some available time and and willing to do that and

873
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.600
they would ask me and I just joined them in that effort and

874
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.300
not knowing really what I was getting involved with but

875
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.300
you know just serving the church

876
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.200
body in that way and tangible ways is

877
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:25.000
a blessing in my life and then

878
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.400
knowing the leadership

879
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.500
that we have and and praying

880
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.600
for our elders our staff our

881
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.400
pastors is

882
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.300
always on my heart they have

883
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.100
A greater. I feel like greater responsibility than even

884
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.200
the deacons do and and lifting them

885
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.400
up and and asking the Lord guidance and

886
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.500
protection upon their families their lives is something

887
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.500
that we need within the church and happy to

888
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.300
bring those men before the Lord

889
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.500
and pray for them often. So that's great. I

890
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.000
appreciate that. And this is

891
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.600
for all three of you Steve will start with you. What's what's as you've

892
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.100
gone through this process that for the last year, you know,

893
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.300
so what's what's one thing

894
00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.500
that you've enjoyed or maybe that you've learned from this

895
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.900
this Deacon process.

896
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.600
One thing I've learned is when they tell you that there's 40 questions.

897
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.800
They don't tell you that there's ABC and

898
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.600
D associated with them. So it is a being 120 or

899
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.200
however many there are so it's not

900
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.100
40, but that process in and

901
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.500
of itself was was probably the longest process

902
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.100
at least for me. I'm not

903
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.900
a student in Reading quickly

904
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.000
and well and remembering well and a lot

905
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:53.700
of times and so just digging through commentaries and

906
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.600
and the word of God and and really fleshing

907
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.200
out what your beliefs are and why

908
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.900
those why you have those beliefs that process

909
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.100
I'll still

910
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.500
go back and reflect on those questions, but that

911
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.100
process was probably the most meaningful and

912
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.200
then meeting with some of

913
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.500
the deacon team and in kind

914
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.800
of discuss it having a discussion of those questions and and

915
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.500
them asking clarification on some

916
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.400
things and getting an opportunity to talk about that and

917
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.500
and share your heart and and listen to

918
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.800
what they may have say about the same question and

919
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.600
getting it maybe a different perspective in that

920
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.200
regard so that that was probably like I

921
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.600
said the lengthiest process and

922
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.000
and the one that

923
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.500
really is most meaningful to

924
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.500
me and having a greater understanding

925
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.800
of the deacon process and just grounding

926
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.300
ground getting being more

927
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.600
grounded in in what you believe and why you believe it.

928
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.100
Now that's that's great and and church, you know,

929
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:05.600
the the questions that that these men answered and

930
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.400
that we use deacons and even Elders have

931
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.300
to answer in some form probably more extensive, but

932
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.300
they really are deep questions and

933
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.300
and make us think but it really is a blessing to

934
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.100
do it and enjoy to even though

935
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.500
it can be challenging. I I still have mine and

936
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.100
in can go back and look at them. So that's that's a beautiful

937
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:26.300
thing.

938
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.100
Um, yeah, I mean, I agree that's I've told a lot of people

939
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:36.100
I think that process of answering those questions. I

940
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.800
think it's good for everyone honestly for myself.

941
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.500
I I didn't

942
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.400
have any Monumental shifts changes in my beliefs

943
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.400
because of those but I I was able to like have

944
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.300
the biblical basis behind that.

945
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.900
So instead of instead of thinking something because it

946
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.300
was traditional it was tradition and I thought

947
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.100
that my whole life I can now have have this

948
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.400
basis which is ground in scripture for

949
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.400
for that that backing but if

950
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.400
I had to answer my own answer instead of piggyback

951
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.800
and Steve I would say I I realized going

952
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.400
into this process really early on that. I wasn't entirely

953
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.500
sure what the deacons do. So I I was

954
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.900
able to I I really enjoyed the stock

955
00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:25.100
book and learning more about

956
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.300
that learning the caveats learning what examples we

957
00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:28.700
have with.

958
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.400
In the New Testament there.

959
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.500
I think that was something that I definitely wanted

960
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.200
to learn pretty early on in the process and I felt like I was able to do that.

961
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.100
Well, I'm going to Echo what both of these guys said I'm gonna piggyback on your

962
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.900
piggyback and say that.

963
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.700
Yeah, I thought that that process was really good and I've told

964
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.900
multiple people as well. I think it would be

965
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.300
good process for anybody to go through whether you're

966
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:58.200
going through a deacon candidate

967
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.300
process or not. I think.

968
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:08.000
Going through that process of considering praying

969
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.300
through.

970
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.600
Understanding the Biblical basis for why you

971
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.400
believe what you believe and then the process of actually putting that down

972
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.000
and riding.

973
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.500
I think was really good and just cementing my

974
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.100
faith and actually building my faith. It's amazing how the Lord can work

975
00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.300
through things that you you know already believe in just

976
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.500
the process of kind of

977
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.400
reiterating those things can actually build your faith even further,

978
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.600
but

979
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.700
yeah, I enjoyed that and I think it was it was

980
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:38.600
good and just

981
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.300
like I say even helped develop my faith even

982
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:42.500
further.

983
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.200
Now, that's great. And and like I said at the

984
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.500
beginning guys, it's been a great joy and privileged to

985
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.400
get to walk through this this process with you. And I think

986
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.200
every time I've gotten to go through it I learned more about

987
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.100
what a deacon does and is supposed to

988
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.300
do and is supposed to be and it's it's

989
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.300
it's really an honor to get to serve

990
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.100
the body. So what we're

991
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.500
gonna do now is we're gonna

992
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.100
have each one of you one by one. We'll call your name.

993
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.600
You'll walk down here John will present

994
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.000
you with the certificate. You'll take a picture as these

995
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.300
men come down if families are here if you'll

996
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.400
make your way up to join them and then

997
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.000
John will say a few things and church.

998
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.300
It's okay to cheer.

999
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.300
when when we when I call their name, right this is and

1000
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.700
and I say that but it's funny but

1001
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.900
Like this is God's faithfulness right here to provide

1002
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.200
us and call men to be Deacons.

1003
00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.200
This is this isn't a popularity contest. I

1004
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.100
mean, I like all these men but they're not sitting up here because I like them or because

1005
00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.400
the DCT likes them it's because it's God's calling their life.

1006
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.100
And so let's let's praise God for that.

1007
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.600
So we'll start here.

1008
00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:00.400
with

1009
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:05.500
always want to call you Ben, but I'm not going to Brad kosanki.

1010
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.400
Yeah, right.

1011
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.100
And then if the cosanki family

1012
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.300
could come join him and then next we have

1013
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.600
Bo Bromley.

1014
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.700
And then last but certainly not least is Steve stolz.

1015
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.900
All right, so you families can come around first.

1016
00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.600
And let you all gather there and then as they're

1017
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.300
coming up here then deacons and Elders who

1018
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.300
are here as well. You can come on up and we're going to surround them

1019
00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:21.100
and pray over them.

1020
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.500
And then if you just want to after they

1021
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.500
make their way up here as well, then you can come pray

1022
00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.400
over them as well. We're gonna pray and then

1023
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.600
we're gonna sing one more song and we do have a reception

1024
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.800
out there afterwards for you. So the reason

1025
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.000
we do it this way as they're coming up is you're coming up

1026
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:42.300
to pray over them is because of what Steve said earlier Acts

1027
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.300
chapter 6 talks this way that that these were

1028
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.100
brought before the apostles and really the whole church and they

1029
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:52.100
laid hands on them and prayed and

1030
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:55.100
that was this sort of ordination Ceremony this

1031
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:57.800
sort of commissioning you might say for

1032
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.000
their role as deacons. So

1033
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.600
that's what we're doing here tonight and commissioning them

1034
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.300
towards the ends that you've heard over

1035
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.200
and over again tonight, but then verse 7, don't

1036
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.900
forget and the word of God continue to multiply and many

1037
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.300
more disciples kept coming to Christ as

1038
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.000
a result.

1039
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.300
Of the calling of the deacons because it

1040
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.100
really propelled the ministry of the church in the ways you've heard

1041
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.100
tonight and many others and so that's what we're doing tonight is just praying

1042
00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.200
and trusting God's going to use this even for more Ministry in

1043
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.200
his kingdom. So let's pray now in this ordination moment

1044
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.300
ordaining them officially as

1045
00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.200
deacons of Henderson Hills God. Thank you so much

1046
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.500
for this celebration tonight that it is.

1047
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.000
That these three men have been deaconing been

1048
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.400
serving in varieties of ways already

1049
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.600
and this is just an official recognition of their

1050
00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.600
their first their character that they

1051
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.400
were men of good repute. Good reputation.

1052
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.100
That we've watched them for years have seen

1053
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.600
and heard affirmation after

1054
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.900
affirmation of their heart their character.

1055
00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.600
their integrity

1056
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.200
both in the church outside the church. We're thankful for that

1057
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.000
God that this is

1058
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.200
this is done tonight with full confidence.

1059
00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.200
That they are yours that they are exemplary in their

1060
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:24.200
character first, but then also got thank you for their hearts that

1061
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.600
have led them to serve as as the

1062
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.900
leading servants now of the church is deacons that

1063
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:33.800
they have the opportunity to care and love

1064
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:37.100
and and serve even

1065
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.200
from way behind the scenes. No one will

1066
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.200
ever know most of what they do.

1067
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:45.300
But you're always watching God. You're always seeing.

1068
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:50.200
Thank you for their hearts in that. I thank you also for their

1069
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.700
wives their children their families.

1070
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.700
Who sacrifice a lot as well?

1071
00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.500
as they serve alongside these men as

1072
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:00.800
they

1073
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.200
allow these men to go serve and spend time outside of

1074
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.800
their homes without them being there.

1075
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.200
It's a sacrifice and so we're thankful for those

1076
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.500
wives and children and they're willingness

1077
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:16.300
to be a part of this process and serving alongside their

1078
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.900
their husbands their father.

1079
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:21.400
Thank you. God for what you've done tonight to

1080
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.600
just reaffirm to these men. I pray they would feel loved and valued

1081
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.700
and encouraged and challenged and cherished first

1082
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:30.700
by you. But then also by us as Elders by

1083
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.600
us as a church.

1084
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.400
That we are setting them apart now by this

1085
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.700
act of laying on of hands this ordination moment.

1086
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.700
But God we pray that it would not just be an affirmation

1087
00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:46.200
of them and their value to you to the kingdom to the

1088
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:46.400
church.

1089
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:49.700
But it would be something that propels the mission forward.

1090
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.800
That many more would come to see you Jesus through

1091
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.900
these men their service to you their their ability

1092
00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.100
to free up us as Elders to

1093
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.200
to teach the word to Shepherd the flock that we can do

1094
00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.700
this better because of them.

1095
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.800
That our churches cared for better because of them that

1096
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.300
more people are loved well and cared for

1097
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:12.000
well because of them.

1098
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.700
So God may all of our deacons feel that.

1099
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.300
May our church know that and how important this

1100
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:19.900
role is.

1101
00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.300
Thank you. God that you've set it up this way. You've

1102
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.400
ordained it to be this way. And now we get to be a

1103
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.000
part of it. So I pray they would feel your love and your

1104
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.800
your blessing as they go forward protect them

1105
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.100
Lord. This is this walking into the

1106
00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:39.400
teeth of the enemy his his desire is

1107
00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.300
to seek and kill and destroy and so we know that they're in the

1108
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.300
crosshairs in some ways. And so we pray your protection over

1109
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:45.400
them.

1110
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.100
That our church would pray deeply for our elders for

1111
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:53.500
our deacons staff that we would feel safe as

1112
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.400

1113
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.000

1114
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.200
Start with them and their families to even tonight. They feel

1115
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.400
your peace as they serve you with all their hearts keeping

1116
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.500
their eyes on you not on fame or recognition or

1117
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.200
anything else. They know you watch and you see and

1118
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.700
you reward.

1119
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.200
But we want to do this for your glory god. Thank you for these
